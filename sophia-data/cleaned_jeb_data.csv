0,Redundancy of olfactory sensory pathways for odor-aversion memory in the terrestrial slug Limax valentianus.,"Terrestrial slugs have the ability to learn and remember a food odor paired with an aversive stimulus. Olfaction in slugs involves the tips of two pairs of tentacles, the superior and the inferior tentacles. Sensory nerves in both pairs of the tentacles transmit olfactory information to the structure in the CNS, the procerebrum where learning and memory formation occur. We investigated the role of each pair of tentacles in odor-aversion learning, and examined the ability of slugs to recall memory after selective surgical amputation. Our results show that memory formation was not altered by the amputation of either one of the pairs before or after odor-aversion learning, while the odor sensibility of the slugs was maintained. These data suggest that either pair of tentacles is sufficient for the acquisition and retrieval of aversive olfactory memory.",10.1242/jeb.018028,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18515713/,Redundancy of olfactory sensory pathways for odor-aversion memory in the terrestrial slug Limax valentianus,"SUMMARY Terrestrial slugs have the ability to learn and remember a food odor paired with an aversive stimulus.

1,High Varroa mite abundance influences chemical profiles of worker bees and mite-host preferences.,"Honeybee disappearance is one of the major environmental and economic challenges this century has to face. The ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor represents one of the main causes of the worldwide beehive losses. Although halting mite transmission among beehives is of primary importance to save honeybee colonies from further decline, the natural route used by mites to abandon a collapsing colony has not been extensively investigated so far. Here, we explored whether, with increasing mite abundance within the colony, mites change their behaviour to maximize the chances of leaving a highly infested colony. We show that, at low mite abundance, mites remain within the colony and promote their reproduction by riding nurses that they distinguish from foragers by different chemical cuticular signatures. When mite abundance increases, the chemical profile of nurses and foragers tends to overlap, promoting mite departure from exploited colonies by riding pollen foragers.

2,On the estimation of swimming and flying forces from wake measurements.,"The transfer of momentum from an animal to fluid in its wake is fundamental to many swimming and flying modes of locomotion. Hence, properties of the wake are commonly studied in experiments to infer the magnitude and direction of locomotive forces. The determination of which wake properties are necessary and sufficient to empirically deduce swimming and flying forces is currently made ad hoc. This paper systematically addresses the question of the minimum number of wake properties whose combination is sufficient to determine swimming and flying forces from wake measurements. In particular, it is confirmed that the spatial velocity distribution (i.e. the velocity field) in the wake is by itself insufficient to determine swimming and flying forces, and must be combined with the fluid pressure distribution. Importantly, it is also shown that the spatial distribution of rotation and shear (i.e. the vorticity field) in the wake is by itself insufficient to determine swimming and flying forces, and must be combined with a parameter that is analogous to the fluid pressure. The measurement of this parameter in the wake is shown to be identical to a calculation of the added-mass contribution from fluid surrounding vortices in the wake, and proceeds identically to a measurement of the added-mass traditionally associated with fluid surrounding solid bodies. It is demonstrated that the velocity/pressure perspective is equivalent to the vorticity/vortex-added-mass approach in the equations of motion. A model is developed to approximate the contribution of wake vortex added-mass to locomotive forces, given a combination of velocity and vorticity field measurements in the wake. A dimensionless parameter, the wake vortex ratio (denoted Wa), is introduced to predict the types of wake flows for which the contribution of forces due to wake vortex added-mass will become non-negligible. Previous wake analyses are re-examined in light of this parameter to infer the existence and importance of wake vortex added-mass in those cases. In the process, it is demonstrated that the commonly used time-averaged force estimates based on wake measurements are not sufficient to prove that an animal is generating the locomotive forces necessary to sustain flight or maintain neutral buoyancy.",10.1242/jeb.01813,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16155224/,On the estimation of swimming and flying forces from wake measurements,"SUMMARY The transfer of momentum from an animal to fluid in its wake is fundamental to many swimming and flying modes of locomotion.

3,"Haze, clouds and limited sky visibility: polarotactic orientation of crickets under difficult stimulus conditions.","Field crickets (Gryllus campestris L.) are able to detect the orientation of the electric vector (e-vector) of linearly polarized light. They presumably use this sense to exploit the celestial polarization pattern for course control or navigation. Polarization vision in crickets can be tested by eliciting a spontaneous polarotactic response. Previously, wide and 100% polarized stimuli were employed to induce this behavior. However, field crickets live on meadows where the observation of the sky is strongly limited by surrounding vegetation. Moreover, degrees of polarization (d) in the natural sky are much lower than 100%. We have therefore investigated thresholds for the behavioral response to polarized light under conditions mimicking those experienced by the insects in the field. We show that crickets are able to rely on polarized stimuli of just 1 degrees diameter. We also provide evidence that they exploit polarization down to an (average) polarization level of less than 7%, irrespective of whether the stimulus is homogeneous, such as under haze, or patched, such as a sky spotted by clouds. Our data demonstrate that crickets can rely on skylight polarization even under unfavorable celestial conditions, emphasizing the significance of polarized skylight orientation for insects.",10.1242/jeb.007831,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17766304/,"Haze, clouds and limited sky visibility: polarotactic orientation of crickets under difficult stimulus conditions","SUMMARY Field crickets (Gryllus campestris L.) are able to detect the orientation of the electric vector (e-vector) of linearly polarized light.

4,FreeClimber: Automated quantification of climbing performance in Drosophila.,"Negative geotaxis (climbing) performance is a useful metric for quantifying Drosophila health. Manual methods to quantify climbing performance are tedious and often biased, while many available computational methods have challenging hardware or software requirements. We present an alternative: FreeClimber. This open source, Python-based platform subtracts a video's static background to improve detection for flies moving across heterogeneous backgrounds. FreeClimber calculates a cohort's velocity as the slope of the most linear portion of a mean-vertical position vs. time curve. It can run from a graphical user interface for optimization or a command line interface for high-throughput and automated batch processing, improving accessibility for users with different expertise. FreeClimber outputs calculated slopes, spot locations for follow up analyses (e.g. tracking), and several visualizations and plots.

5,Habitat-dependent transmission of male advertisement calls in bladder grasshoppers (Orthoptera; Pneumoridae).,"It has been hypothesized that the physical properties of the environment exert selection pressure on long-range acoustic communication signals to match the local habitat by promoting signal characteristics that minimize excess attenuation and distortion. We tested this in a unique family of bladder grasshoppers notable for producing a signal with a 2 km maximum transmission distance. In direct performance comparisons, male advertisement calls of seven species were broadcast through four vegetation biomes--forest, fynbos, savanna and succulent karoo. The calls of species native to forest and fynbos biomes propagated with lower levels of distortion over distance in their respective habitats relative to those of non-native species, while fynbos species also performed best in the remaining two habitats. In addition, both forest and fynbos species had low levels of signal attenuation over distance in all environments. The fynbos biome was characterized by high inconsistency in signal degradation, while the forest biome had the highest levels of environmental noise.

6,Dynamin-association with agonist-mediated sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptor in single-cell eukaryote Paramecium.,"Evidence that dynamin is associated with the sequestration of the Paramecium beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) immunoanalogue is presented. We previously reported a dramatic change in the distribution of betaAR analogue in the subcellular fractions upon isoproterenol treatment: it is redistributed from the membraneous to the cytosolic fraction, as revealed by quantitative image analysis of western blots.

7,Directional escape behavior in allis shad (Alosa alosa) exposed to ultrasonic clicks mimicking an approaching toothed whale.,"Toothed whales emit high-powered ultrasonic clicks to echolocate a wide range of prey. It may be hypothesized that some of their prey species have evolved capabilities to detect and respond to such ultrasonic pulses in a way that reduces predation, akin to the situation for many nocturnal insects and echolocating bats. Using high-speed film recordings and controlled exposures, we obtained behavioural evidence that simulated toothed whale biosonar clicks elicit highly directional anti-predator responses in an ultrasound-sensitive allis shad (Alosa alosa). Ten shad were exposed to 192 dB re. 1 μPa (pp) clicks centred at 40 kHz at repetition rates of 1, 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1) with summed energy flux density levels of 148, 161, 165 and 172 dB re. 1 μPa(2) s. The exposures mimicked the acoustic exposure from a delphinid toothed whale in different phases of prey search and capture. The response times of allis shad were faster for higher repetition rates of clicks with the same sound pressure level. None of the fish responded to a single click, but had median response times of 182, 93 and 57 ms when exposed to click rates of 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1), respectively. This suggests that the ultrasound detector of allis shad is an energy detector and that shad respond faster when exposed to a nearby fast-clicking toothed whale than to a slow-clicking toothed whale far away. The findings are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shad ultrasound detection is used for reducing predation from echolocating toothed whales.",10.1242/jeb.043323,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21147965/,Directional escape behavior in allis shad (Alosa alosa) exposed to ultrasonic clicks mimicking an approaching toothed whale,"SUMMARY Toothed whales emit high-powered ultrasonic clicks to echolocate a wide range of prey.

8,Behavioural and physiological state dependency of host seeking in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus.,"Vertebrate blood is essential for the growth and the reproduction of haematophagous insects. Provided that hosts play the double role of food sources and predators, feeding on their blood exposes these insects to a high predation risk. Therefore, it is expected that host seeking occurs only when insects need to feed. In the present study, we analyse how the feeding status affects the response to host-associated cues in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus. We show that the responsiveness to host-associated cues, such as CO(2) and heat, and that the motivation to feed depend on the time elapsed since a blood meal. Depending on the time elapsed after feeding, the same concentration of CO(2) may attract or repel the insects. As far as we know, this is the first time that a host signal has been shown to be repellent for a haematophagous insect. The response to heat is also modulated but no repellence was observed. When blood was replaced by saline solution as food, a significant reduction of the response to both signals was evinced but repellence was not observed. The injection of haemolymph from fed insects into starved insects inhibited the response of the receiver insects to both signals but this was not observed after the injection of saline solution or of haemolymph from non-fed insects. This is the first time that the modulation of feeding behaviour by the feeding status has been analysed in a hemimetabolous blood-sucking insect, fully excluding any effect of other processes, such as reproduction.",10.1242/jeb.030668,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19617431/,Behavioural and physiological state dependency of host seeking in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus,"SUMMARY Vertebrate blood is essential for the growth and the reproduction of haematophagous insects.

As far as we know, this is the first time that a host signal has been shown to be repellent for a haematophagous insect. The response to heat is also modulated but no repellence was observed. When blood was replaced by saline solution as food, a significant reduction of the response to both signals was evinced but repellence was not observed. The injection of haemolymph from fed insects into starved insects inhibited the response of the receiver insects to both signals but this was not observed after the injection of saline solution or of haemolymph from non-fed insects. This is the first time that the modulation of feeding behaviour by the feeding status has been analysed in a hemimetabolous blood-sucking insect, fully excluding any effect of other processes, such as reproduction."
9,The biomechanics of tree frogs climbing curved surfaces: a gripping problem.,"The adhesive mechanisms of climbing animals have become an important research topic because of their biomimetic implications. We examined the climbing abilities of hylid tree frogs on vertical cylinders of differing diameter and surface roughness to investigate the relative roles of adduction forces (gripping) and adhesion. Tree frogs adhere using their toe pads and subarticular tubercles, the adhesive joint being fluid-filled. Our hypothesis was that on an effectively flat surface (adduction forces on the largest 120 mm diameter cylinder were insufficient to allow climbing), adhesion would effectively be the only means by which tree frogs could climb, but on the 44 and 13 mm diameter cylinders, frogs could additionally utilise adduction forces by gripping the cylinder either with their limbs outstretched or by grasping around the cylinder with their digits, respectively. The frogs' performance would also depend on whether the surfaces were smooth (easy to adhere to) or rough (relatively non-adhesive). Our findings showed that climbing performance was highest on the narrowest smooth cylinder. Frogs climbed faster, frequently using a 'walking trot' gait rather than the 'lateral sequence walk' used on other cylinders. Using an optical technique to visualise substrate contact during climbing on smooth surfaces, we also observed an increasing engagement of the subarticular tubercles on the narrower cylinders. Finally, on the rough substrate, frogs were unable to climb the largest diameter cylinder, but were able to climb the narrowest one slowly.

11,Gene expression profiling of genetically determined growth variation in bivalve larvae (Crassostrea gigas).,"Growth rates in animals are governed by a wide range of biological factors, many of which remain poorly understood.

Based on transcriptomic profiling of 4.5 million cDNA sequence tags, we sequenced and annotated 181 cDNA clones identified by statistical analysis as candidates for differential growth. Significant matches were found in GenBank for 43% of clones (N=78), including 34 known genes. These sequences included genes involved in protein metabolism, energy metabolism and regulation of feeding activity.

15,"Sensory-induced modification of two motor patterns in the crab, Cancer pagurus.","Sensory input is pervasive among motor networks and continuously adapts motor patterns to changing circumstances. To elucidate common principles of sensorimotor integration, it is beneficial to characterize sensory influences on motor network operation and compare these influences between species. To facilitate such comparison, we have studied the influence of the anterior gastric receptor (AGR) - a proprioceptor that has been characterized in detail in two lobster species - on the pyloric (filtering of food) and gastric mill (chewing of food) motor patterns in the crab Cancer pagurus. AGR has a bipolar cell body in the stomatogastric ganglion; it was activated by tension increase in gastric mill powerstroke muscles. While two spike initiation zones accounted for its spontaneous activity, active membrane properties (sag potentials, spike frequency adaptation) contributed to the AGR response to current injections. When activated, AGR diminished spike activities in two pyloric motor neurons and prolonged the pyloric cycle period. Furthermore, AGR excited gastric mill protractor neurons, inhibited the retractor neuron and evoked phase-independent resetting of the gastric mill rhythm. Repetitive spike trains entrained the rhythm to both longer and shorter cycle periods. All AGR actions seemed to be mediated via at least two premotor projection neurons in the spatially distant commissural ganglia. The response of the gastric mill neurons was independent of AGR firing frequency. Our results suggest that homologous proprioceptors can elicit similar effects on motor patterns while utilizing different mechanisms.

16,Modulation of environmental light alters reception and production of visual signals in Nile tilapia.,"Signal reception and production form the basis of animal visual communication, and are largely constrained by environmental light. However, the role of environmental light in producing variation in either signal reception or production has not been fully investigated. To chart the effect of environmental light on visual sensitivity and body colouration throughout ontogeny, we measured spectral sensitivity, lens transmission and body pattern reflectance from juvenile and adult Nile tilapia held under two environmental light treatments. Spectral sensitivity in juveniles reared under a broad-spectrum light treatment and a red-shifted light treatment differed mostly at short wavelengths, where the irradiance of the two light treatments differed the most. In contrast, adults held under the same two light treatments did not differ in spectral sensitivity. Lens transmission in both juveniles and adults did not differ significantly between environmental light treatments, indicating that differences in spectral sensitivity of juveniles originated in the retina.

17,Metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis is not associated with large-scale nuclear DNA content variation.,"Amphibian metamorphosis is a complex process that has been speculated to involve DNA amplification and chromatin rearrangement. While recent studies have concentrated on chromatin rearrangement, only a few studies have dealt with variation in the amount of DNA during amphibian metamorphosis. In this study, nuclei were isolated from Xenopus laevis at various developmental stages. The nuclei were examined in both an unfixed state and a fixed state. The nuclei were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their fluorescence intensity. The unfixed nuclei had higher fluorescence variation compared with the fixed nuclei. This increase in variation appeared due to the presence of nuclei of variable fluorescence intensity within the unfixed nuclei. Upon optimum fixation, which has been speculated to result in more homogeneous chromatin conformation and to reduce staining artifacts, the nuclei were observed to have less fluorescence intensity variation. The differential fluorescence observed in this study is consistent with the hypothesis that large-scale intra-individual DNA variation is not associated with amphibian metamorphosis.",10.1242/jeb.01304,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15557032/,Metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis is not associated with large-scale nuclear DNA content variation,"SUMMARY Amphibian metamorphosis is a complex process that has been speculated to involve DNA amplification and chromatin rearrangement.

19,Escape manoeuvres in damsel-fly larvae: kinematics and dynamics.,"The kinematics and hydrodynamics of rapid escape manoeuvres executed by final-stage larvae of Enallagma cyathigerum were investigated using videography combined with a simple wake-visualisation technique. Two kinds of escape manoeuvres were identified: first, a 'rapid flex', comparable with the rapid C-start of fish, and, second, a 'rapid twist' that involves a helical contraction of the body inducing motion in the yaw, pitch and roll planes. In both cases, the initial flexion phase is concerned with re-orientating the body, the extensional phase with acceleration of the body in the new direction. The behaviour of the caudal fin during twist indicates considerable independence of movement and aspect control within the three constituent lobes.

The estimated momentum of the ring vortex containing the jet was similar to that imparted to the body at the start of the translational phase.

21,Comparative feeding kinematics of tropical hylid tadpoles.,"Anuran larvae, which are otherwise simple in shape, typically have complex keratinized mouthparts (i.e. labial teeth and jaw sheaths) that allow them to graze upon surfaces. The diversity in these structures among species presumably reflects specializations that allow for maximal feeding efficiency on different types of food. However, we lack a general understanding of how these oral structures function during feeding. We used high-speed digital imaging (500 Hz) to observe tadpoles of six species from the anuran family Hylidae grazing on a standardized food-covered substrate. Tadpoles of these species vary in the number of labial tooth rows, belong to two different feeding guilds (benthic and nektonic), and inhabit ponds and streams. We confirmed that the labial teeth in these species serve two functions: anchoring the mouth to the substrate and raking material off of the substrate. In general, tadpoles with a larger maximum gape or those with fewer labial tooth rows opened and closed their mouths slower than tadpoles with smaller gape or more tooth rows. Nektonic feeding tadpoles released each of their tooth rows proportionally earlier in the gape cycle compared with benthic feeding tadpoles. Lastly, we found some support for the idea that deformation of the jaw sheaths during a feeding cycle is predictable based on tadpole feeding guild.

22,"Microspectrophotometry of visual pigments and oil droplets in a marine bird, the wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus: topographic variations in photoreceptor spectral characteristics.","Microspectrophotometric examination of the retina of a procellariiform marine bird, the wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus, revealed the presence of five different types of vitamin A(1)-based visual pigment in seven different types of photoreceptor. A single class of rod contained a medium-wavelength sensitive visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (lambda(max)) at 502 nm. Four different types of single cone contained visual pigments maximally sensitive in either the violet (VS, lambda(max) 406 nm), short (SWS, lambda(max) 450 nm), medium (MWS, lambda(max) 503 nm) or long (LWS, lambda(max) 566 nm) spectral ranges. In the peripheral retina, the SWS, MWS and LWS single cones contained pigmented oil droplets in their inner segments with cut-off wavelengths (lambda(cut)) at 445 (C-type), 506 (Y-type) and 562 nm (R-type), respectively. The VS visual pigment was paired with a transparent (T-type) oil droplet that displayed no significant absorption above at least 370 nm. Both the principal and accessory members of the double cone pair contained the same 566 nm lambda(max) visual pigment as the LWS single cones but only the principal member contained an oil droplet, which had a lambda(cut) at 413 nm. The retina had a horizontal band or 'visual streak' of increased photoreceptor density running across the retina approximately 1.5 mm dorsal to the top of the pecten. Cones in the centre of the horizontal streak were smaller and had oil droplets that were either transparent/colourless or much less pigmented than at the periphery. It is proposed that the reduction in cone oil droplet pigmentation in retinal areas associated with high visual acuity is an adaptation to compensate for the reduced photon capture ability of the narrower photoreceptors found there.

23,Learning and memory in Lymnaea are negatively altered by acute low-level concentrations of hydrogen sulphide.,"Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is a common industrial pollutant as well as an endogenous neural transmitter/neural modulator.

24,Coordinating compass-based and nest-based flight directions during bumblebee learning and return flights.,"Bumblebees tend to face their nest over a limited range of compass directions when learning the nest's location on departure and finding it on their approach after foraging. They thus obtain similar views of the nest and its surroundings on their learning and return flights. How do bees coordinate their flights relative to nest-based and compass-based reference frames to get such similar views? We show, first, that learning and return flights contain straight segments that are directed along particular compass bearings, which are independent of the orientation of a bee's body. Bees are thus free within limits to adjust their viewing direction relative to the nest, without disturbing flight direction. Second, we examine the coordination of nest-based and compass-based control during likely information gathering segments of these flights: loops during learning flights and zigzags on return flights. We find that bees tend to start a loop or zigzag when flying within a restricted range of compass directions and to fly towards the nest and face it after a fixed change in compass direction, without continuous interactions between their nest-based and compass-based directions of flight. A preferred trajectory of compass-based flight over the course of a motif, combined with the tendency of the bees to keep their body oriented towards the nest automatically narrows the range of compass directions over which bees view the nest.

27,Color discrimination in the red range with only one long-wavelength sensitive opsin.,"The basic precondition for color vision is the presence of at least two receptor types with different spectral sensitivities. The sensitivity of a receptor is mostly defined by the opsin-based visual pigment expressed in it. We show here, through behavioral experiments, that the nymphalid butterfly Heliconius erato, although it expresses short and medium wavelength opsins and only one long wavelength opsin, discriminates colors in the long-wavelength range (590 nm, 620 nm and 640 nm), whereas another nymphalid, Vanessa atalanta, despite having color vision, is unable to do so. In the eyes of H. erato we identified filtering pigments very close to the rhabdom which differ between ommatidia and produce the yellow and red ommatidial reflection seen under orthodromic illumination. The eyes of V. atalanta lack the filtering pigments, and reflect a homogeneous orange.

28,Sprint sensitivity and locomotor trade-offs in green anole (Anolis carolinensis) lizards.,"How well an organism completes an ecologically relevant task - its performance - is often considered a key factor in determining individual fitness. Historically, ecomorphological studies have examined how morphological traits determine individual performance in a static manner, assuming that differential fitness in a population is due indirectly to differences in morphological traits that determine a simple measure of performance. This assumption, however, ignores many ecological factors that can constrain performance in nature, such as substrate variation and individual behavior. We examined some of these complexities in the morphology-performance-fitness paradigm, primarily the impact that substrate variation has on performance. We measured maximal sprint speed of green anole lizards on four substrates that varied in size and complexity and are used by or available to individuals in nature. Performance decreased significantly from a broad substrate to a narrow substrate, and lizards were three times slower on a complex substrate than the broadest substrate. We also detected trade-offs in running on substrates with different diameters and in cluttered versus uncluttered environments. Furthermore, morphological predictors of performance varied among substrates. This indicates that natural selection may act on different morphological traits, depending on which substrates are used by individuals, as well as an individual's ability to cope with changes in substrate rather than maximal capacities.

29,Path selection in cockroaches.,"In gregarious insects, the exploration and the use of the home range can involve both individual navigational abilities and/or chemical trails. Trail formation can result from an active laying of pheromones but can also derive from the incidental deposition of chemical cues. In this study, we investigated whether scent trails can influence path selection in the cockroach Blattella germanica (L.). Experiments were designed to separate the role of prior experience based on the orientation of the path and the presence of trails. In a first phase, cockroaches were able to access freely one or two branches of a platform during a 48 h period. In a second phase, cockroaches were offered a binary choice between one marked and one clean branch, or between two clean branches. In the absence of trails, cockroaches prefer the novel orientation but in the presence of a trail previously laid by the same group of individuals, they prefer the path with the trail, irrespective of orientation. However, cockroaches tended to avoid trails laid by a different group of cockroaches. Overall, our results indicate that both scent cues and response to novelty influence, weakly but significantly, path selection in cockroaches. The plausible nature of scent marks used by cockroaches is discussed.

31,The role of serotonin in the enhancement of long-term memory resulting from predator detection in Lymnaea.,"Serotonergic systems play important roles in modulating stress-induced arousal and vigilance behaviours. The pond snail, Lymnaea, shows multiple defensive vigilance behaviours in response to the stress associated with predator detection. Predator detection elicited by crayfish effluent (CE), increases the time to re-emerge from the shell and enhances the shadow withdrawal response. More importantly, in Lymnaea, CE enhances the ability to form long-term memory (LTM). We investigated the role of the serotonergic system in these anti-predator responses in Lymnaea. Using a serotonin-receptor antagonist, mianserin, we found that two defensive vigilance behaviours (e.g. increasing the time to re-emerge from their shell and shadow response) elicited by CE were not observed when the serotonergic system was disrupted. Also, methysergide, another serotonin antagonist, blocked the enhanced LTM formation after training in CE. Importantly, mianserin did not alter LTM formation in pond water (PW). These data suggest that a serotonergic system is activated only when Lymnaea detect a predator. When snails were trained in CE using a training procedure that in PW produces a 24-h LTM, a more persistent form of LTM (5 days) occurred. This more persistent form of LTM was abolished after mianserin treatment. Increasing 5-HT levels in the snail by the injection of 5-HT was also associated with enhanced LTM formation. Lastly, we tested whether the osphradium is implicated in CE detection and subsequent enhanced formation of LTM. Cutting the osphradial nerve to the CNS resulted in the loss of the ability to form enhanced LTM in CE. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the serotonergic system plays a key role in modulating the predator-induced stress responses in Lymnaea.",10.1242/jeb.048256,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20952608/,The role of serotonin in the enhancement of long-term memory resulting from predator detection in Lymnaea,"SUMMARY Serotonergic systems play important roles in modulating stress-induced arousal and vigilance behaviours.

33,Adding 'epi-' to behaviour genetics: implications for animal domestication.,"In this review, it is argued that greatly improved understanding of domestication may be gained from extending the field of behaviour genetics to also include epigenetics. Domestication offers an interesting framework of rapid evolutionary changes caused by well-defined selection pressures. Behaviour is an important phenotype in this context, as it represents the primary means of response to environmental challenges. An overview is provided of the evidence for genetic involvement in behavioural control and the presently used methods for finding so-called behaviour genes. This shows that evolutionary changes in behaviour are to a large extent correlated to changes in patterns of gene expression, which brings epigenetics into the focus. This area is concerned with the mechanisms controlling the timing and extent of gene expression, and a lot of focus has been placed on methylation of cytosine in promoter regions, usually associated with genetic downregulation. The review considers the available evidence that environmental input, for example stress, can modify methylation and other epigenetic marks and subsequently affect behaviour. Furthermore, several studies are reviewed, demonstrating that acquired epigenetic modifications can be inherited and cause trans-generational behaviour changes.

34,Kinematics of aquatic and terrestrial escape responses in mudskippers.,"Escape responses in fishes are rapid behaviors that are critical for survival. The barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilineatus) is an amphibious fish that must avoid predators in two environments. We compared mudskipper terrestrial and aquatic escapes to address two questions. First, how does an amphibious fish perform an escape response in a terrestrial environment? Second, how similar is a terrestrial escape response to an aquatic escape response? Because a mudskipper on land does not have to contend with the high viscosity of water, we predicted that, if the same behavior is employed across environments, terrestrial escape responses should have 'better' performance (higher velocity and more rapid completion of movements) when compared with aquatic escape responses. By contrast, we predicted that intervertebral bending would be similar across environments because previous studies of escape response behaviors in fishes have proposed that vertebral morphology constrains intervertebral bending. High-speed digital imaging was used to record mudskipper escapes in water and on land, and the resulting images were used to calculate intervertebral bending during the preparatory phase, peak velocity and acceleration of the center of mass during the propulsive phase, and relative timing of movements. Although similar maximum velocities are achieved across environments, terrestrial responses are distinct from aquatic responses. During terrestrial escapes, mudskippers produce greater axial bending in the preparatory phase, but only in the posterior region of the body and over a much longer time period. Mudskippers also occasionally produced the 'wrong' behavior for a given environment. Thus, it appears that the same locomotor morphology is recruited differently by the central nervous system to produce a distinct behavior appropriate for each environment.",10.1242/jeb.01237,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15498949/,Kinematics of aquatic and terrestrial escape responses in mudskippers,"SUMMARY Escape responses in fishes are rapid behaviors that are critical for survival.

36,"To paddle or not: context dependent courtship display by male blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus.","The nature of the courtship signalling used by a species is shaped by many factors, one of which is its habitat. Male blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, have a courtship display in which they elevate their body by standing high on their legs, open their chelae and paddle their swimming legs. This courtship display is not reported in other swimming (portunid) crabs and is rarely expressed in laboratory experiments on male blue crabs. In this study, we characterised this display, which we call ;courtship stationary paddling', and distinguished it from other types of paddling. To explain the species specificity of courtship stationary paddling, we hypothesised that this behaviour is an adaptation to low visibility and abundant refuges in the habitat of blue crabs, and that this behaviour enhances chemical signalling when females are relatively inaccessible to males. We used particle imaging velocimetry to visualise water currents generated during courtship stationary paddling, showing that it created water currents directed away from the male and towards the female, thus enhancing chemical signalling. We also showed that males did not perform courtship stationary paddling when females were freely walking such that males could quickly contact and cradle carry them. Rather, males typically performed courtship stationary paddling only when females were inaccessible to them.

37,IRS and TOR nutrient-signaling pathways act via juvenile hormone to influence honey bee caste fate.,"Regardless of genetic makeup, a female honey bee becomes a queen or worker depending on the food she receives as a larva. For decades, it has been known that nutrition and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling determine the caste fate of the individual bee. However, it is still largely unclear how these factors are connected. To address this question, we suppressed nutrient sensing by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) and TOR (target of rapamycin) in larvae reared on queen diet. The treatments affected several layers of organismal organization that could play a role in the response to differential nutrition between castes. These include transcript profiles, proteomic patterns, lipid levels, DNA methylation response and morphological features. Most importantly, gene knockdown abolished a JH peak that signals queen development and resulted in a worker phenotype. Application of JH rescued the queen phenotype in either knockdown, which demonstrates that the larval response to JH remains intact and can drive normal developmental plasticity even when IRS or TOR transcript levels are reduced. We discuss our results in the context of other recent findings on honey bee caste and development and propose that IRS is an alternative substrate for the Egfr (epidermal growth factor receptor) in honey bees.

38,Polyamines as olfactory stimuli in the goldfish Carassius auratus.,"Electrophysiological responses of goldfish olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and goldfish behavioral responses to polyamines were investigated in vivo. Electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings indicated that polyamines (putrescine, cadaverine and spermine) are potent olfactory stimuli for goldfish with estimated electrophysiological thresholds of 10(-8)-10(-7) mol l(-1), similar to that for L-arginine, the most stimulatory amino acid. Although thresholds were similar, the magnitude of the EOG responses to intermediate (10(-5)-10(-4) mol l(-1)) and high (10(-3) mol l(-1)) concentrations of polyamines dwarfed the responses to amino acids and related single amine containing compounds (amylamine and butylamine). The EOG responses to 0.1 mmol l(-1) putrescine, cadaverine and spermine were, respectively, 4.2x, 4.3x and 10.3x the response of the standard, 0.1 mmol l(-1) L-arginine. Electrophysiological cross-adaptation experiments indicated that polyamine receptor sites are independent from those to L-amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamate, lysine, methionine and ornithine), bile salts (sodium taurocholate and taurolithocholate), the single amine containing compounds (amylamine and butylamine) and ATP. Further, the cross-adaptation experiments revealed the existence of independent receptor sites for the different polyamines tested.

Intermuscular pressure ranged between 100 and 700 mbar (70,000 Pa) for forces up to 287 N. These pressures are similar to previous (intramuscular) recordings within skeletal muscles of different vertebrate species. Furthermore, our results suggest that the rise in intermuscular pressure during contraction may reduce the force production in muscle packages (compartments). Summary: The intermuscular pressure between synergistic muscles correlates with muscle force.",True,"The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between muscle force generated during isometric contractions (i.e. at a constant muscle–tendon unit length) and the intermuscular (between adjacent muscles) pressure in synergistic muscles. Therefore, the pressure at the contact area of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscle was measured synchronously to the force of the whole calf musculature in the rabbit species Oryctolagus cuniculus. Similar results were obtained when using a conductive pressure sensor, or a fibre-optic pressure transducer connected to a water-filled balloon.

42,Assessing a relationship between bone microstructure and growth rate: a fluorescent labelling study in the king penguin chick (Aptenodytes patagonicus).,"Microstructure-function relationships remain poorly understood in primary bone tissues. The relationship between bone growth rate and bone tissue type, although documented in some species by previous works, remains somewhat unclear and controversial. We assessed this relationship in a species with extreme adaptations, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). These birds have a peculiar growth, interrupted 3 months after hatching by the austral winter. Before this interruption, chicks undergo extremely rapid statural and ponderal growth. We recorded experimentally (by means of fluorescent labelling) the growth rate of bone tissue in four long bones (humerus, radius, femur and tibiotarsus) of four king penguin chicks during their fastest phase of growth (3-5 weeks after hatching) and identified the associated bone tissue types ('laminar', 'longitudinal', 'reticular' or 'radial' fibro-lamellar bone tissue). We found the highest bone tissue growth rate known to date, up to 171 microm day(-1) (mean 55 microm day(-1)). There was a highly significant relationship between bone tissue type and growth rate (P<10(-6)). Highest rates were obtained with the radial microarchitecture of fibro-lamellar bone, where cavities in the woven network are aligned radially.

Greater activity in the wet season reflects a release of constraints on ion and water balance independent of changes in exercise physiology. The respiratory responses to walking exercise by D. hirtipes were assessed with regard to humidity and season. In the laboratory, crabs walked 38% faster when humidity was high, while the O(2) uptake across the lung became diffusion limited despite a Ca(2+)-induced increase in O(2) affinity of the haemocyanin. Crabs walking in 90% relative humidity exhibited a larger metabolic acidosis while re-oxidation of l-lactate was only 0.49 mmol l(-1) h(-1). The wet-season crabs were more active and exhibited a respiratory acidosis compared with the quiescent dry-season crabs. The migration was close to the limit of the aerobic scope of the crabs, and the pulmonary oxygen partial pressure (P(O(2))) was depressed, the O(2) uptake diffusion limited and the arterial-venous P(O(2)) difference diminished. Additional, enforced exercise induced a metabolic acidosis. The optimum strategy for migration would be walking continuously but at a speed within the aerobic scope.

45,Patterns of variation in feeding strike kinematics of juvenile ghost praying mantis (Phyllocrania paradoxa): are components of the strike stereotypic?,"Functional systems, such as feeding mechanics, often involve the evolution of several components of the musculoskeletal system that are moved in coordination to capture prey.

46,Packaging of chemicals in the defensive secretory glands of the sea hare Aplysia californica.,"Sea hares protect themselves from predatory attacks with several modes of chemical defenses. One of these is inking, which is an active release of a protective fluid upon predatory attack. In many sea hares including Aplysia californica and A. dactylomela, this fluid is a mixture of two secretions from two separate glands, usually co-released: ink, a purple fluid from the ink gland; and opaline, a white viscous secretion from the opaline gland. These two secretions are mixed in the mantle cavity and directed toward the attacking predator. Some of the chemicals in these secretions and their mechanism of action have been identified. In our study, we used western blots, immunocytochemistry, amino acid analysis, and bioassays to examine the distribution of these components: (1) an L-amino acid oxidase called escapin for A. californica and dactylomelin-P for A. dactylomela, which has antimicrobial activity but we believe its main function is in defending sea hares against predators that evoke its release; and (2) escapin's major amino acid substrates--L-lysine and L-arginine. Escapin is exclusively produced in the ink gland and is not present in any other tissues or secretions. Furthermore, escapin is only sequestered in the amber vesicles of the ink glandand not in the red-purple vesicles, which contain algal-derived chromophores that give ink its distinctive purple color. The concentration of escapin and dactylomelin-P in ink, both in the gland and after its release, is as high as 2 mg ml(-1), or 30 micromol ml(-1), which is well above its antimicrobial threshold. Lysine and arginine (and other amino acids) are packaged into vesicles in the ink and opaline glands, but arginine is present in ink and opaline at <1 mmol l(-1) and lysine is present in ink at <1 mmol l(-1) but in opaline at 65 mmol l(-1). Our previous results showed that both lysine and arginine mediate escapin's bacteriostatic effects, but only lysine mediates its bactericidal effects. Given that escapin's antimicrobial effects require concentrations of lysine and/or arginine >1 mmol l(-1), our data lead us to conclude that lysine in opaline is the primary natural substrate for escapin in ink.

47,The functional significance of the lower temporal bar in Sphenodon punctatus.,"One of the major conundrums in the evolution of vertebrate cranial design is the early loss and frequent redevelopment of the lower temporal bar in diapsids.

As the sole recent representative of the Rhynchocephalia, Sphenodon punctatus is different from other extant lepidosaurians in having a fully diapsid skull and in using translation to shear food rather than using the typical puncture-crushing of other lizards. In the present study, we show that S. punctatus has lower bite forces compared with extant lepidosaurians. Moreover, dissection of the jaw muscles of an adult S. punctatus shows that the mass of the external jaw adductor muscle is significantly smaller than that of lizards, probably accounting for the lower measured bite forces. An analysis of the transport cycles suggests a less efficient prey transport in S. punctatus compared with an agamid lizard of similar size in terms of handling time and number of cycles needed to crush similar prey.

48,Mechanical phase shifters for coherent acoustic radiation in the stridulating wings of crickets: the plectrum mechanism.,"Male crickets produce stridulatory songs using engaged tegmina (forewings): a plectrum on the left sweeps along a tooth row on the right. During stridulation, the plectrum moves across the teeth and vibrations are amplified by the surrounding cells and veins, resonating at the frequency of tooth impacts. The advance of the plectrum on the file is controlled by an escapement mechanism so that passing each single tooth generates one wave of a highly tonal signal. Both tegmina must oscillate in phase to avoid destructive interference. But as each plectrum-tooth contact begins, the right and left tegmina react in opposite oscillatory directions. A mechanical phase shifter is part of the left tegmen and compensates to achieve wing oscillation synchrony. We use a new technique to simulate plectrum-on-file interactions: in combination with laser vibrometry, this technique assessed plectrum mechanics in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Using an excised teneral file, shaped like a partial gear and moved by a motor, and a microscan Doppler laser vibrometer, plectrum and left-tegmen mechanics were explored. The results show that plectrum and harp oscillate with a phase difference of ca. 156 deg., a shift rather than a complete phase inversion (180 deg.). This phase shift occurs at the site of a large wing vein (possibly A3).

49,Phenotypic plasticity and experimental evolution.,"Natural or artificial selection that favors higher values of a particular trait within a given population should engender an evolutionary response that increases the mean value of the trait. For this prediction to hold, the phenotypic variance of the trait must be caused in part by additive effects of alleles segregating in the population, and also the trait must not be too strongly genetically correlated with other traits that are under selection. Another prediction, rarely discussed in the literature, is that directional selection should favor alleles that increase phenotypic plasticity in the direction of selection, where phenotypic plasticity is defined as the ability of one genotype to produce more than one phenotype when exposed to different environments. This prediction has received relatively little empirical attention. Nonetheless, many laboratory experiments impose selection regimes that could allow for the evolution of enhanced plasticity (e.g. desiccation trials with Drosophila that last for several hours or days). We review one example that involved culturing of Drosophila on lemon for multiple generations and then tested for enhanced plasticity of detoxifying enzymes. We also review an example with vertebrates that involves selective breeding for high voluntary activity levels in house mice, targeting wheel-running behavior on days 5+6 of a 6-day wheel exposure. This selection regime allows for the possibility of wheel running itself or subordinate traits that support such running to increase in plasticity over days 1-4 of wheel access. Indeed, some traits, such as the concentration of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in gastrocnemius muscle, do show enhanced plasticity in the selected lines over a 5-6 day period. In several experiments we have housed mice from both the Selected (S) and Control (C) lines with or without wheel access for several weeks to test for differences in plasticity (training effects). A variety of patterns were observed, including no training effects in either S or C mice, similar changes in both the S and C lines, greater changes in the S lines but in the same direction in the C lines, and even opposite directions of change in the S and C lines. For some of the traits that show a greater training effect in the S lines, but in the same direction as in C lines, the greater effect can be explained statistically by the greater wheel running exhibited by S lines ('more pain, more gain'). For others, however, the differences seem to reflect inherently greater plasticity in the S lines (i.e. for a given amount of stimulus, such as wheel running/day, individuals in the S lines show a greater response as compared with individuals in the C lines). We suggest that any selection experiment in which the selective event is more than instantaneous should explore whether plasticity in the appropriate (adaptive) direction has increased as a component of the response to selection.",10.1242/jeb.02244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16731811/,Phenotypic plasticity and experimental evolution,"SUMMARY Natural or artificial selection that favors higher values of a particular trait within a given population should engender an evolutionary response that increases the mean value of the trait.

51,The effects of surface diameter and incline on the hindlimb kinematics of an arboreal lizard (Anolis sagrei).,"Arboreal animals often move in habitats with dense vegetation, narrow perches and variable inclines, but effects of arboreal habitat structure on locomotor function are poorly understood for most animals. Several species of Anolis lizards, which have served as a model group for relating locomotor performance to morphology, have decreased maximal sprinting speeds when perch diameter decreases. However, the effects of perch diameter on the limb movements of Anolis have not been previously studied. Hence, we quantified the hindlimb movements of Anolis sagrei, which naturally occurs on a wide variety of perch diameters and inclines. We analyzed similar speeds of steady locomotion for combinations of flat surfaces and round perches with diameters of 1, 3, 6 and 10 cm and inclines of 0 degrees and uphill 45 degrees and 90 degrees. Diameter significantly affected more kinematic variables than incline, but many kinematic variables changed little with increases in diameter beyond 6 cm. As surface diameter increased, the limb posture of A. sagrei became progressively more sprawled. Significantly greater knee flexion during stance was important for locating the foot more medially during movement on narrow perches. Stride length increased and femur depression, femur retraction and long-axis femur rotation decreased significantly as the surface diameter increased. The low hip heights on the vertical incline and the narrowest perches suggest that bringing the center of mass closer to the locomotor surface is important in these circumstances for reducing the tendency to topple backwards or sideways. Most of the kinematic changes of A. sagrei with decreased perch diameter were opposite those correlated with increased speeds of locomotion for terrestrial lizards. The foot was most lateral to the hip during the swing phase and maximal lateral displacements decreased with decreased perch diameter. Consequently, the width required to accommodate limb movement also decreased as perch diameter decreased.",10.1242/jeb.00995,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15143145/,The effects of surface diameter and incline on the hindlimb kinematics of an arboreal lizard (Anolis sagrei),"SUMMARY Arboreal animals often move in habitats with dense vegetation, narrow perches and variable inclines, but effects of arboreal habitat structure on locomotor function are poorly understood for most animals.

53,Drosophila melanogaster locomotion in cold thin air.,"The alpine environment is likely to challenge insect locomotion because of low mean temperatures and reduced barometric pressure. In this study, we measured the direct and interactive effects of these factors on walking and flight performance of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. We found that decreased temperature and decreased air pressure both reduced walking speed and flight performance. Flies walked more slowly at 18 degrees C and in the lowest air pressure treatment (34 kPa). This treatment, equivalent in air pressure to the top of Mount Everest, was the only air pressure that significantly reduced fly walking speed. Therefore, walking performance in the wild is likely limited by temperature, but not oxygen availability. In contrast to walking performance, low but ecologically realistic air pressures dramatically reduced overall flight performance. The effects of reduced air pressure on flight performance were more pronounced at colder temperatures. Reduced flight performance in high altitude conditions was primarily driven by an increased reluctance for flies to initiate flight rather than outright failure to fly.

When comparing CoT values across small (<10 kg) mammals, ferrets demonstrated a lower than predicted metabolic cost during both tunnel and terrestrial locomotion, whereas degus were very close to the line of best fit. Although tunnel locomotion requires a more striking change in posture for ferrets, ferrets are more efficient locomotors in both conditions than mammals of similar mass. Summary: The energetic cost of locomotion in a simulated tunnel exceeds that of overground locomotion in two semi-fossorial mammal species (ferrets and degus)."
55,"The protective effect of rapid cold-hardening develops more quickly in frozen versus supercooled larvae of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica.","During the austral summer, larvae of the terrestrial midge Belgica antarctica (Diptera: Chironomidae) experience highly variable and often unpredictable thermal conditions. In addition to remaining freeze tolerant year-round, larvae are capable of swiftly increasing their cold tolerance through the rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response. The present study compared the induction of RCH in frozen versus supercooled larvae. At the same induction temperature, RCH occurred more rapidly and conferred a greater level of cryoprotection in frozen versus supercooled larvae. Furthermore, RCH in frozen larvae could be induced at temperatures as low as -12°C, which is the lowest temperature reported to induce RCH. Remarkably, as little as 15 min at -5°C significantly enhanced larval cold tolerance. Not only is protection from RCH acquired swiftly, but it is also quickly lost after thawing for 2 h at 2°C. Because the primary difference between frozen and supercooled larvae is cellular dehydration caused by freeze concentration of body fluids, we also compared the effects of acclimation in dehydrated versus frozen larvae. Because slow dehydration without chilling significantly increased larval survival to a subsequent cold exposure, we hypothesize that cellular dehydration caused by freeze concentration promotes the rapid acquisition of cold tolerance in frozen larvae.

56,Cutaneous water loss and lipids of the stratum corneum in house sparrows Passer domesticus from arid and mesic environments.,"Birds that live in hot, dry environments must balance water intake with losses in order to maintain water homeostasis. The outer layer of the integument, called the stratum corneum (SC), consists of corneocytes embedded in a matrix of lipids. The SC serves as a barrier to water vapor diffusion through the skin. We measured cutaneous water loss (CWL) in two populations of house sparrow Passer domesticus L., one living in a desert environment in Saudi Arabia, and another living in a mesic environment in Ohio, USA. We found that CWL rates at 30 degrees C were lower in desert individuals (11.9+/-2.2 mg H(2)O cm(-2) day(-1); N=11) than in mesic birds (16.0+/-2.6 mg H(2)O cm(-2) day(-1); N=14). We hypothesized that changes in the lipid composition of the SC could affect CWL. We analyzed four classes of lipids in the SC: ceramides, cerebrosides, cholesterol and free fatty acids, by thin layer chromatography. Compared to mesic sparrows, desert birds had a higher amount of ceramides (49.2+/-10.3 mg g(-1) SC dry mass in Saudi Arabia; 38.2+/-18.0 mg g(-1) SC dry mass in Ohio) and cerebrosides (101.2+/-48.9 mg g(-1) SC dry mass in Saudi Arabia; 56.5+/-34.0 mg g(-1) SC dry mass in Ohio), and a lower percentage of cholesterol (4.1+/-3.6% in Saudi Arabia; 5.4+/-2.5% in Ohio) in their SC. Although CWL was lower in sparrows from Arabia, and lipid composition of their SC differed, we could not detect differences between rates of water loss through non-living skin attached to glass vials (46.0+/-15.7 mg H(2)O cm(-2) day(-1) for sparrows in Saudi Arabia; 45.8+/-27.2 mg H(2)O cm(-2) day(-1) for sparrows in Ohio).

We report on aversive learning studies in drone and worker honey bees (Apis mellifera anatolica) in escape, punishment and discriminative punishment situations. In all three experiments, a newly developed electric shock avoidance assay was used. The comparisons of expected and observed responses were performed with conventional statistical methods and a systematic randomization modeling approach called object oriented modeling. The escape experiment consisted of two measurements recorded in a master-yoked paradigm: frequency of response and latency to respond following administration of shock. Master individuals could terminate an unavoidable shock triggered by a decrementing 30 s timer by crossing the shuttlebox centerline following shock activation. Across all groups, there was large individual response variation. When assessing group response frequency and latency, master subjects performed better than yoked subjects for both workers and drones. In the punishment experiment, individuals were shocked upon entering the shock portion of a bilaterally wired shuttlebox. The shock portion was spatially static and unsignalled. Only workers effectively avoided the shock. The discriminative punishment experiment repeated the punishment experiment but included a counterbalanced blue and yellow background signal and the side of shock was manipulated.

58,Determination of pH by microfluorometry: intracellular and interstitial pH regulation in developing early-stage fish embryos (Danio rerio).,"Microfluorometric techniques were applied in vivo for continuous monitoring of specific acid-base parameters in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos during early stages of ontogeny. Dextran-coupled pH-sensitive single-excitation/dual-emission dye SNARF-1 was pressure-injected into individual cells or the interstitial space of 16- to 256-cell embryos, and pH was continuously recorded during subsequent development for time periods of up to 8 h. A novel calibration technique was developed, essentially characterized by in vitro inorganic buffer calibration of the optical system and mathematical post-processing according to the effects of in vivo dye modifiers through a correlation established by direct comparison of optical techniques with pH microelectrodes. This approach results in high accuracy of microfluorometry, comparable with that of pH electrodes, and a recovery only limited by the physical stability of the utilized optical system. Intracellular pH (pHi) in Danio rerio embryos between 1k-cells stage and the end of epiboly was found to be well regulated to a mean value of 7.55+/-0.13 (+/-s.d.), a range distinctly more alkaline than typical values for adult fish but in accordance with embryonic pHi of a few non-fish species shortly after fertilization. Also, interstitial pH (pHint) was significantly higher (8.08+/-0.25) than values for extracellular pH in adult fish. Distributions of HCO3- across membranes and between interstitium and ambient fluid compared with respective potentials strongly suggest that pH in these early stages of ontogeny is already adjusted by active transfer processes. Non-respiratory changes in ambient pH between 7.7 and 8.5 did not significantly affect pHi, a result potentially attributable to low membrane leakage rate or to the potency of active transfer mechanisms. In order to assess the pH regulatory systems more quantitatively, embryos were exposed to ambient changes of carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2). The direct impact of PCO2 changes on cell pH was alleviated by cell non-bicarbonate buffering and subsequent rapid, almost complete, compensation by changes in cell [HCO3-] as an expression of transmembrane transfer of acid-base relevant ions.

61,Mechanical and energetic consequences of rolling foot shape in human walking.,"During human walking, the center of pressure under the foot progresses forward smoothly during each step, creating a wheel-like motion between the leg and the ground. This rolling motion might appear to aid walking economy, but the mechanisms that may lead to such a benefit are unclear, as the leg is not literally a wheel. We propose that there is indeed a benefit, but less from rolling than from smoother transitions between pendulum-like stance legs. The velocity of the body center of mass (COM) must be redirected in that transition, and a longer foot reduces the work required for the redirection. Here we develop a dynamic walking model that predicts different effects from altering foot length as opposed to foot radius, and test it by attaching rigid, arc-like foot bottoms to humans walking with fixed ankles. The model suggests that smooth rolling is relatively insensitive to arc radius, whereas work for the step-to-step transition decreases approximately quadratically with foot length. We measured the separate effects of arc-foot length and radius on COM velocity fluctuations, work performed by the legs and metabolic cost. Experimental data (N=8) show that foot length indeed has much greater effect on both the mechanical work of the step-to-step transition (23% variation, P=0.04) and the overall energetic cost of walking (6%, P=0.03) than foot radius (no significant effect, P>0.05). We found the minimum metabolic energy cost for an arc foot length of approximately 29% of leg length, roughly comparable to human foot length. Our results suggest that the foot's apparently wheel-like action derives less benefit from rolling per se than from reduced work to redirect the body COM.

62,Air sac PO2 and oxygen depletion during dives of emperor penguins.,"In order to determine the rate and magnitude of respiratory O2 depletion during dives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), air sac O2 partial pressure (PO2) was recorded in 73 dives of four birds at an isolated dive hole.

Such age-dependent plasticity has important implications in a variety of evolutionary and ecological contexts, particularly with respect to understanding adaptive responses to heterogeneous environments. In this study, we used experimental diet manipulation to examine the life-history trajectory of plasticity in the feeding complex of a model organism, the white rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We demonstrate that, contrary to expectations derived from previous cross-sectional studies of skeletal plasticity, the jaws of weanlings and young adults exhibit similar increases in relative bone cross-sectional areas in response to the introduction of mechanically challenging foods into their diets. Furthermore, we present evidence that sensitivity to loading patterns persists well into adulthood in some regions of the masticatory apparatus in rabbits, indicating that there is an extended window of opportunity to respond to changes in dietary properties during an animal's life span. We conclude that certain aspects of the facial skeleton of rabbits, and perhaps mammals in general, are sensitive to environmental stimuli long after skeletal maturity is achieved, highlighting the importance of plasticity as a source of adaptive variation at later life-history stages.

64,Effects of running on human Achilles tendon length-tension properties in the free and gastrocnemius components.,"The elastic properties of the human Achilles tendon are important for locomotion; however, in vitro tests suggest that repeated cyclic contractions lead to tendon fatigue - an increase in length in response to stress applied. In vivo experiments have not, however, demonstrated mechanical fatigue in the Achilles tendon, possibly due to the limitations of using two-dimensional ultrasound imaging to assess tendon strain. This study used freehand three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) to determine whether the free Achilles tendon (calcaneus to soleus) or the gastrocnemius tendon (calcaneus to gastrocnemius) demonstrated tendon fatigue after running exercise. Participants (N=9) underwent 3DUS scans of the Achilles tendon during isometric contractions at four ankle torque levels (passive, and 14, 42 and 70 N m) before and after a 5 km run at a self-selected pace (10-14 km h(-1)). Running had a significant main effect on the length of the free Achilles tendon (P<0.01) with a small increase in length across the torque range. However, the mean lengthening effect was small (<1%) and was not accompanied by a change in free tendon stiffness. There was no significant change in the length of the gastrocnemius tendon or the free tendon cross-sectional area. While the free tendon was shown to lengthen, the lack of change in stiffness suggests the tendon exhibited mechanical creep rather than fatigue. These effects were much smaller than those predicted from in vitro experiments, possibly due to the different loading profile encountered and the ability of the tendon to repair in vivo.

65,Structural and functional adaptation to hypoxia in the rat brain.,"Chronic exposure to a hypoxic environment leads to structural and functional adaptations in the rat brain.

68,"The effect of hypoxia on gill morphology and ionoregulatory status in the Lake Qinghai scaleless carp, Gymnocypris przewalskii.","Goldfish and crucian carp at low temperature exhibit plasticity in gill morphology during exposure to hypoxia to enhance gas exchange. Hypoxia-induced changes in gill morphology and cellular ultrastructure of the high altitude scaleless carp from Lake Qinghai, China, were investigated to determine whether this is a general characteristic of cold water carp species. Fish were exposed to acute hypoxia (0.3 mg O2 l(-1)) for 24 h followed by 12 h recovery in normoxic water (6 mg O2 l(-1) at 3200 m altitude), with no mortality. Dramatic alterations in gill structure were initiated within 8 h of hypoxia and almost complete by 24 h, and included a gradual reduction of filament epithelial thickness (>50%), elongation of respiratory lamellae, expansion of lamellar respiratory surface area (>60%) and reduction in epithelial water-blood diffusion distance (<50%). An increase in caspase 3 activity in gills occurred following 24 h exposure to hypoxia, indicating possible involvement of apoptosis in gill remodeling. Extensive gill mucous production during hypoxia may have been part of a general stress response or may have played a role in ion exchange and water balance. The large increase in lamellar surface area and reduction in diffusion distance presumably enhances gas transfer during hypoxia (especially in the presence of increased mucous production) but comes with an ionoregulatory cost, as indicated by a 10 and 15% reduction in plasma [Na+] and [Cl-], respectively, within 12-24 h of hypoxia.

Although the large morphological changes in the gill observed in the scaleless carp support the hypothesis that gill remodeling during hypoxia is a general characteristic of cold water carp species, the reduced magnitude of the response in scaleless carp relative to goldfish and crucian carp may be a reflection of their more active lifestyle or because they reside in a moderately hypoxic environment at altitude."

However, the cause of bradycardia remains unresolved. To investigate this, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; acclimated at 12°C) were exposed to acute warming while electrocardiograms were recorded. From 12°C to 25.3°C, electrical excitation between different parts of the heart was coordinated, but above 25.3°C, atrial and ventricular beating rates became partly dissociated because of 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. With further warming, atrial rate increased to a peak value of 188±22 beats min−1 at 27°C, whereas the ventricle rate peaked at 124±10 beats min−1 at 25.3°C and thereafter dropped to 111±15 beats min−1 at 27°C. In single ventricular myocytes, warming from 12°C to 25°C attenuated electrical excitability as evidenced by increases in rheobase current and the size of critical depolarization required to trigger action potential. Depression of excitability was caused by temperature-induced decrease in input resistance (sarcolemmal K+ leak via the outward IK1 current) of resting myocytes and decrease in inward charge transfer by the Na+ current (INa) of active myocytes. Collectively, these findings show that at critically high temperatures AV block causes ventricular bradycardia owing to the increased excitation threshold of the ventricle, which is due to changes in the passive (resting ion leak) and active (inward charge movement) electrical properties of ventricular myocytes.

Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould Physarum polycephalum (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while P. polycephalum is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, P. polycephalum reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While P. polycephalum altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from P. polycephalum with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies.

75,Oxygen delivery to the fish eye: root effect as crucial factor for elevated retinal PO2.,"Although the retina has one of the highest metabolic rates among tissues, certain teleost fishes lack any vascular supply to this organ which, in combination with the overall thickness of the organ, results in extremely long diffusion distances. As the only way to compensate for these obstacles, oxygen partial pressure (PO2) in the eyes of such fish is elevated far above atmospheric values. Although not supported by any direct evidence, the enhancement of PO2 is considered to be related to the Root effect, the release upon acidification of Hb-bound O2 into physical dissolution, possibly supported by counter-current multiplication similar to the loop of Henle. The present study evaluates the magnitude of intraocular PO2 enhancement under tightly controlled physiological conditions, to directly confirm the involvement of the Root effect on intraocular PO2 in the retina of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraocular PO2 was determined with special polarographic microelectrodes inserted into the eye. PO2 profiles established in vivo by driving electrodes through the entire retina yielded average PO2 values between 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) at the inner retinal surface and 382 mmHg (50.9 kPa) close to the outer retinal limit (Bruch's membrane). According to estimates on the basis of the diffusion distances determined from sections of the retina (approximately 436 microm at the site of PO2 measurement) and literature data on specific oxygen consumption, the in vivo determined values would be sufficient to cover the oxygen demand of the retina with some safety margin. For a clear and direct in-tissue-test as to the involvement of the Root effect, an isolated in vitro eye preparation was established in order to avoid the problem of indirect blood supply to the eye from the dorsal aorta only via the pseudobranch, a hemibranch thought to modulate blood composition before entry of the eye. Any humoral effects (e.g. catecholamines) were eliminated by perfusing isolated eyes successively with standardized red blood cell (RBC) suspensions in Ringer, using trout (with Root) and human (lacking any Root effect) RBC suspension. To optimize perfusate conditions for maximal Root effect, the Root effect of trout RBCs was determined in vitro via graded acidification of individual samples equilibrated with standardized gas mixtures. During perfusion with trout RBC, PO2 at the outer retinal limit was 99 mmHg (13.2 kPa), but fell by a factor of 3.3 upon perfusion with human RBC in spite of higher total oxygen content (TO2 2.8 for trout vs 3.9 mmol l-1 for human RBC). Upon reperfusion with trout RBC, PO2 was restored immediately to the original value. This regularly observed pattern indicated a highly significant difference (P=0.003) between perfusion with trout (with Root effect; high retinal PO2) and perfusion with human (no Root effect; low retinal PO2) RBC suspension, thus clearly demonstrating that the Root effect is directly involved and a crucial prerequisite for the enhancement of PO2 in the retina of the teleost eye.",10.1242/jeb.01874,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244163/,Oxygen delivery to the fish eye: Root effect as crucial factor for elevated retinal PO2,"SUMMARY Although the retina has one of the highest metabolic rates among tissues, certain teleost fishes lack any vascular supply to this organ which, in combination with the overall thickness of the organ, results in extremely long diffusion distances.

To optimize perfusate conditions for maximal Root effect, the Root effect of trout RBCs was determined in vitro via graded acidification of individual samples equilibrated with standardized gas mixtures. During perfusion with trout RBC, PO2 at the outer retinal limit was 99 mmHg (13.2 kPa), but fell by a factor of 3.3 upon perfusion with human RBC in spite of higher total oxygen content (TO2 2.8 for trout vs 3.9 mmol l-1 for human RBC). Upon reperfusion with trout RBC, PO2 was restored immediately to the original value. This regularly observed pattern indicated a highly significant difference (P=0.003) between perfusion with trout (with Root effect; high retinal PO2) and perfusion with human (no Root effect; low retinal PO2) RBC suspension, thus clearly demonstrating that the Root effect is directly involved and a crucial prerequisite for the enhancement of PO2 in the retina of the teleost eye."
76,Host nutrition determines blood nutrient composition and mediates parasite developmental success: Manduca sexta L. parasitized by Cotesia congregata (Say).,"This investigation examined the influence of dietary protein and carbohydrate balance in a chemically defined artificial diet for Manduca sexta larvae on development of the gregarious parasite Cotesia congregata. Normal unparasitized larvae and larvae superparasitized in the fourth stadium were reared to the end of the fifth stadium on six diets, each having the same total amount of casein and sucrose but with different ratios ranging from high protein/no carbohydrate through to low protein/high carbohydrate. Levels of blood protein nitrogen and trehalose, nutrients supporting growth and development of C. congregata, varied with diet and were influenced by parasitism. Different levels of blood metabolites reflected differences in diet consumption, and the relationships between protein nitrogen and trehalose were very similar to those for protein and carbohydrate intake by parasitized and normal larvae on various diets. Dietary nutrient ratio had a significant effect on parasite burden, the numbers of parasites developing in individual host larvae and on parasite biomass. Parasites included individuals that developed and eventually emerged as second instar larvae, moulted to third instars and pupated. Many apparently mature second instar parasites, however, failed to emerge. The proportion of non-emerging individuals varied with diet, and in some cases, parasites failing to emerge were greater in number and total biomass than those that did emerge to complete development. On most diets, the mass of individual parasites was similar regardless of dietary nutrient ratio. Three dimensional models developed to demonstrate the relationships between blood protein nitrogen and trehalose levels and parasite burden and biomass established that the levels of both metabolites are important for supporting growth and development of emerged and non-emerged parasites. In the case of emerged parasites, however, the relationships are linear, and a quadratic function best describes the relationships with non-emerged parasites. Blood metabolite levels supporting the greatest parasite burden and biomass of emerged and non-emerged parasites occupy a region of two dimensional space corresponding to approximately 60-200 mg per insect of protein nitrogen and 60-100 mg per insect of trehalose. Despite the differences in the response of emerged and non-emerged parasites to host nutrition, the present results indicate that host nutrition is not the critical factor determining parasite emergence.

77,Temperature-dependent modification of muscle precursor cell behaviour is an underlying reason for lasting effects on muscle cellularity and body growth of teleost fish.,"Temperature is an important factor influencing teleost muscle growth, including a lasting ('imprinted') influence of embryonic thermal experience throughout all further life.

The study reported here used digital morphometry and immunolabelling for Pax7, myogenin and H3P to quantitatively examine the effects of thermal history on muscle precursor cell (MPC) behaviour and muscle growth in pearlfish (Rutilus meidingeri) until the adult stage. Fish were reared at three different temperatures (8.5, 13 and 16°C) until hatching and subsequently kept under the same (ambient) thermal conditions.

83,Establishing food site vectors in desert ants.,"When returning to the site of a successful previous forage, where does one search for the goodies?

84,"Feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities in bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus).","Feeding kinematics, suction and hydraulic jetting capabilities of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) were characterized during controlled feeding trials. Feeding trials were conducted both on land and in water, and allowed a choice between suction and biting, but food was also presented that could be ingested by suction alone. Four feeding phases, preparatory, jaw opening, hyoid depression and jaw closing were observed; the mean feeding cycle duration was 0.54+/-0.22 s, regardless of feeding mode (P>0.05). Subjects feeding on land used biting and suction 89.3% and 10.7% of the time, respectively. Subjects feeding in water used suction and hydraulic jetting 96.3% and 3.7% of the time, respectively. No biting behavior was observed underwater. Suction feeding was characterized by a small gape (2.7+/-0.85 cm), small gape angle (24.4+/-8.13 degrees ), pursing of the rostral lips to form a circular aperture, and pursing of the lateral lips to occlude lateral gape. Biting was characterized by large gape (7.3+/-2.2 cm), large gape angle (41.7+/-15.2 degrees ), and lip curling to expose the teeth.

85,Mechanical performance of spider orb webs is tuned for high-speed prey.,"Spiders in the Orbiculariae spin orb webs that dissipate the mechanical energy of their flying prey, bringing the insects to rest and retaining them long enough for the spider to attack and subdue their meals. Small prey are easily stopped by webs but provide little energetic gain. While larger prey offer substantial nourishment, they are also challenging to capture and can damage the web if they escape. We therefore hypothesized that spider orb webs exhibit properties that improve their probability of stopping larger insects while minimizing damage when the mechanical energy of those prey exceeds the web's capacity. Large insects are typically both heavier and faster flying than smaller prey, but speed plays a disproportionate role in determining total kinetic energy, so we predicted that orb webs may dissipate energy more effectively under faster impacts, independent of kinetic energy per se. We used high-speed video to visualize the impact of wooden pellets fired into orb webs to simulate prey strikes and tested how capture probability varied as a function of pellet size and speed. Capture probability was virtually nil above speeds of ~3 m s(-1). However, successful captures do not directly measure the maximum possible energy dissipation by orb webs because these events include lower-energy impacts that may not significantly challenge orb web performance. Therefore, we also compared the total kinetic energy removed from projectiles that escaped orb webs by breaking through the silk, asking whether more energy was removed at faster speeds. Over a range of speeds relevant to insect flight, the amount of energy absorbed by orb webs increases with the speed of prey (i.e. the rates at which webs are stretched). Orb webs therefore respond to faster - and hence higher kinetic energy - prey with better performance, suggesting adaptation to capture larger and faster flying insect prey. This speed-dependent toughness of a complex structure suggests the utility of the intrinsic toughness of spider silk and/or features of the macro-design of webs for high-velocity industrial or military applications, such as ballistic energy absorption.

86,"The unequal influences of the left and right vagi on the control of the heart and pulmonary artery in the rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus.","Autonomic control of the cardiovascular system in reptiles includes sympathetic components but heart rate (f(H)), pulmonary blood flow (Q(pul)) and cardiac shunt patterns are primarily controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system. The vagus innervates both the heart and a sphincter on the pulmonary artery. The present study reveals that whereas both the left and right vagi influence f(H), it is only the left vagus that influences pulmonary vascular resistance. This is associated with the fact that rattlesnakes, in common with some other species of snakes, have a single functional lung, as the other lung regresses during development. Stimulation of the left cervical vagus in anaesthetised snakes slowed the heart and markedly reduced blood flow in the pulmonary artery whereas stimulation of the right cervical vagus slowed the heart and caused a small increase in stroke volume (V(S)) in both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Central stimulation of either vagus caused small (5-10%) reductions in systemic blood pressure but did not affect blood flows or f(H). A bilateral differentiation between the vagi was confirmed by progressive vagotomy in recovered snakes. Transection of the left vagus caused a slight increase in f(H) (10%) but a 70% increase in Q(pul), largely due to an increase in pulmonary stroke volume (V(S,pul)). Subsequent complete vagotomy caused a 60% increase in f(H) accompanied by a slight rise in Q(pul), with no further change in V(S,pul). By contrast, transection of the right vagus elicited a slight tachycardia but no change in V(S,pul). Subsequent complete vagotomy was accompanied by marked increases in f(H), Q(pul) and V(S,pul).

We have previously shown that selection for starvation resistance results in increased sleep and reduced feeding in adult flies.

We found that selection for starvation resistance resulted in delayed development and a reduction in metabolic rate in larvae that persisted into adulthood, suggesting that these traits may allow for the accumulation of energy stores and an increase in body size within these selected populations. In addition, we found that larval sleep was largely unaffected by starvation selection and that feeding increased during the late larval stages, suggesting that experimental evolution for starvation resistance produces developmentally specified changes in behavioral regulation.

Interestingly, the presence of stable SCs did not prevent mitochondrial H2O2 production and was not associated with elevated respiration rates of mitochondria isolated from the examined species. Together, these data show that SC stability varies among vertebrates and is greatest in poikilothermic reptiles and weakest in endotherms. This pattern suggests an adaptive role of SCs to varying body temperature, but not necessarily a direct effect on electron transfer or in the prevention of ROS production."
91,Smelling your way to food: can bed bugs use our odour?,"The resurgence in developed countries of the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, has led to a search for new sustainable methods to monitor and control this human ectoparasite. Because of increased resistance to insecticides, traps baited with attractive cues are considered a promising method to be developed into efficient monitoring tools for bed bugs. Despite their potential as attractants, only a few studies have investigated the odorant cues implicated in the attraction of bed bugs to human hosts. In this study, we used aeration extracts from human volunteers to assess the role of olfaction in host searching by bed bugs. By coupled gas chromatography and single sensillum recordings on all the antennal sensilla, we measured the electrophysiological response elicited by the compounds present in our human odour extracts. Only five compounds were clearly detected by the olfactory receptor neurons housed in the smooth-peg sensilla of the bed bugs. We tested the behavioural effect of these extracts in a still-air arena and showed a gradient of repellence linked to the dose, as well as a higher propensity of local search behaviour associated with human odours containing a lower ratio of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one to C(7)-C(10) aldehydes.

Some members of this genus are able to survive extreme desiccation by entering into a state of suspended animation known as anhydrobiosis. We have assembled a collection of Panagrolaimus species and strains and have investigated their anhydrobiotic phenotypes. Our data show that within the genus Panagrolaimus there is a continuum of strains ranging from those unable to survive exposure to low relative humidity (RH) without prior preconditioning at high RH (slow desiccation strategists), through strains that have limited ability to survive rapid desiccation but whose anhydrobiotic ability improves upon preconditioning, to strains such as P. superbus that can readily survive immediate exposure to severe desiccation (fast desiccation strategists). Using this panel of nematodes we investigated the effect of preincubation at high RH on the accumulation of trehalose and on the nematodes' anhydrobiotic potential. We found that there is a strong correlation between trehalose induction and anhydrobiotic survival in Panagrolaimus. Furthermore, the high trehalose levels observed in fully hydrated P. superbus (10% dry mass) suggest that constitutive expression of trehalose pre-adapts this fast dehydration strategist to combat desiccation.

To gain a better understanding of the impacts of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated impacts of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined responses of dung beetles exposed to constant (20°C), low fluctuation (20±5°C), or high fluctuation (20±12°C) temperature treatments using respirometry, energetic reserves, and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rates or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high amplitude fluctuations. We found 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high amplitude fluctuation. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity.

Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation. Highlighted Article: Dung beetles respond to temperature fluctuations in different ways depending on the amplitude of fluctuation. However, any temperature fluctuation increased transcripts associated with open chromatin structure relative to constant temperatures."
98,When navigating wood ants use the centre of mass of a shape to extract directional information from a panoramic skyline.,"Bees and ants can control their direction of travel within a familiar landscape using the information available in the surrounding visual scene. To learn more about the visual cues that contribute to this directional control, we have examined how wood ants obtain direction from a single shape that is presented in an otherwise uniform panorama. Earlier experiments revealed that when an ant's goal is aligned with a point within a prominent shape, the ant is guided by a global property of the shape: it learns the relative areas of the shape that lie to its left and right when facing the goal and sets its path by keeping the proportions at the memorised value. This strategy cannot be applied when the direction of the goal lies outside the shape. To see whether a different global feature of the shape might guide ants under these conditions, we trained ants to follow a direction to a point outside a single shape and then analysed their direction of travel when they were presented with different shapes. The tests indicate that ants learn the retinal position of the centre of mass of the training shape when facing the goal and can then guide themselves by placing the centre of mass of training and test shapes in this learnt position.",10.1242/jeb.136697,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26994187/,When navigating wood ants use the centre of mass of a shape to extract directional information from a panoramic skyline,"ABSTRACT Bees and ants can control their direction of travel within a familiar landscape using the information available in the surrounding visual scene.

99,Endothermy of dynastine scarab beetles (Cyclocephala colasi) associated with pollination biology of a thermogenic arum lily (Philodendron solimoesense).,"Cyclocephala colasi beetles are facultative endotherms that spend most of their adult lives inside the inflorescences of Philodendron solimoesense, where ambient temperature (T(a)) averages about 28 degrees C due to floral thermogenesis. Measurements of respiration within a range of T(a) showed that active beetles became spontaneously endothermic at T(a) below 28 degrees C but were rarely endothermic above it. There was no evidence of endothermy within the inflorescences, indicating that activities in the floral chamber can occur without the high energy expense of endothermy. Bouts of endothermy occurred at lower T(a) in respirometer chambers mainly in the evening, when the insects normally fly from one inflorescence to another, and during the night, when they normally eat and mate within the inflorescence. Patterns of endothermy in individual episodes were studied in non-flying beetles with respirometry and infrared thermal imaging. Heat was generated in the thorax by oscillatory waves of respiration that were coupled with thoracic temperature (T(th)) increases. Stationary beetles could regulate T(th) at about 33 degrees C independently of T(a) between 16 and 29 degrees C. At T(a)=20 degrees C, this represents a 116-fold increase in metabolic rate over resting, ectothermic values. Endothermy was clearly a requirement for flight, and beetles departing inflorescences warmed to about 30 degrees C before take-off. During flight, T(th) was dependent on T(a), decreasing from 37 to 28 degrees C at T(a) of 37 to 20 degrees C, respectively. The lowest T(a) at which flight could occur was about 20 degrees C.

Therefore, this study investigated the tissue distribution patterns of C-type allatostatin and its putative receptor in the mud crab Scylla paramamosain, and further explored its potential effect on vitellogenesis. Firstly, cDNAs encoding C-type allatostatin (Sp-AST-C) precursor and its putative receptor (Sp-AST-CR) were isolated. Subsequently, RT-PCR revealed that Sp-AST-C was mainly expressed in the nervous tissue, middle gut and heart, whereas Sp-AST-CR had extensive expression in all tissues tested except the eyestalk ganglion and hepatopancreas. In addition, in situ hybridization in the cerebral ganglion showed that Sp-AST-C was localized in clusters 6 and 8 of the protocerebrum, clusters 9, 10 and 11 of the deutocerebrum, and clusters 14 and 15 of the tritocerebrum. Whole-mount immunofluorescence revealed a similar distribution pattern. Synthetic Sp-AST-C had no effect on the abundance of S. paramamosain vitellogenin (Sp-Vg) in the hepatopancreas and ovary in vitro but significantly reduced the expression of its receptor (Sp-VgR) in the ovary in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Sp-VgR expression, vitellin content and oocyte diameter in the ovary were reduced 16 days after the first injection of Sp-AST-C.

Here, we examined the thermal physiology of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas Linnaeus 1758), a globally invasive species, along three parallel thermal gradients in its native and invasive ranges. At each site, we assessed cardiac physiology to determine heat and cold tolerance and acclimatory plasticity. We found that, overall, the species is highly tolerant of both heat and cold, and that it survives higher temperatures than co-occurring native marine crustaceans. Further, we found that both heat and cold tolerance are plastic in response to short-term acclimation (18-31 days at either 5 or 25°C). Comparing patterns within ranges, we found latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance in the native European range and in the invasive range in eastern North America. This pattern is strongest in the native range, and likely evolved there. Because of a complicated invasion history, the latitudinal pattern in the eastern North American invasive range may be due either to rapid adaptation post-invasion or to adaptive differences between the ancestral populations that founded the invasion. Overall, the broad thermal tolerance ranges of green crabs, which may facilitate invasion of novel habitats, derive from high inherent eurythermality and acclimatory plasticity and potentially adaptive differentiation among populations. The highly flexible physiology that results from these capacities may represent the hallmark of a successful invasive species, and may provide a model for success in a changing world.

105,Phenotypic plasticity in blood-oxygen transport in highland and lowland deer mice.,"In vertebrates living at high altitude, arterial hypoxemia may be ameliorated by reversible changes in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (regulated by erythropoiesis) and/or changes in blood-oxygen affinity (regulated by allosteric effectors of hemoglobin function). These hematological traits often differ between taxa that are native to different elevational zones, but it is often unknown whether the observed physiological differences reflect fixed, genetically based differences or environmentally induced acclimatization responses (phenotypic plasticity). Here, we report measurements of hematological traits related to blood-O2 transport in populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are native to high- and low-altitude environments.

106,"The energy budget, thermogenic capacity and behavior in Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in temperatures.","The limitation on sustainable energy intake (SusEI) is important because it establishes the upper energetic limit on the ability of animals to disperse, survive and reproduce. However, there are still arguments about what factors impose that limitation. Thermoregulation in cold environments imposes great energy demands on small mammals. A cold-exposed animal has been suggested to be a model suitable for testing these factors. Here, we examined the changes in food intake and digestible energy intake (DEI) as measures of SusEI, thermogenic capacity and behavioral patterns in Swiss mice exposed to consecutively lower ambient temperatures from 23 to -15°C. Cold-exposed mice showed significant decreases in body mass, fat content of the carcass and body temperature, and increases in DEI compared with controls. The time spent on feeding significantly increased with decreasing temperatures, and time spent on general activity decreased following cold exposure. Resting metabolic rate, nonshivering thermogenesis and serum tri-iodothyronine levels significantly increased in mice exposed to lower temperatures in comparison with controls, whereas these thermogenic variables were not significantly different between 0 and -15°C. It might suggest that SusEI in cold exposed Swiss mice was constrained peripherally by the capacity to produce heat and also by the ability to dissipate body heat, but to a different extent. Moderate cold exposure might result in a relaxation of the heat dissipation limit (HDL), allowing the animals to increase food intake to meet cold stress. When animals are exposed to severe cold, the thermogenenic capacity might reach a ceiling, failing to compensate for the heat loss and which would finally result in lower body temperature and considerable weight loss. This might indicate that the HDL was set at a higher level than peripheral limits for Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in ambient temperatures.",10.1242/jeb.046821,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21075940/,"The energy budget, thermogenic capacity and behavior in Swiss mice exposed to a consecutive decrease in temperatures","SUMMARY The limitation on sustainable energy intake (SusEI) is important because it establishes the upper energetic limit on the ability of animals to disperse, survive and reproduce.

107,The temperature dependence of electrical excitability in fish hearts.,"Environmental temperature has pervasive effects on the rate of life processes in ectothermic animals. Animal performance is affected by temperature, but there are finite thermal limits for vital body functions, including contraction of the heart. This Review discusses the electrical excitation that initiates and controls the rate and rhythm of fish cardiac contraction and is therefore a central factor in the temperature-dependent modulation of fish cardiac function. The control of cardiac electrical excitability should be sensitive enough to respond to temperature changes but simultaneously robust enough to protect against cardiac arrhythmia; therefore, the thermal resilience and plasticity of electrical excitation are physiological qualities that may affect the ability of fishes to adjust to climate change. Acute changes in temperature alter the frequency of the heartbeat and the duration of atrial and ventricular action potentials (APs). Prolonged exposure to new thermal conditions induces compensatory changes in ion channel expression and function, which usually partially alleviate the direct effects of temperature on cardiac APs and heart rate.

In both contexts, there is an opportunity for foragers to associate warmth with food rewards. However, honeybee thermal learning is poorly understood.

109,Control of moth flight posture is mediated by wing mechanosensory feedback.,"Flying insects rapidly stabilize after perturbations using both visual and mechanosensory inputs for active control. Insect halteres are mechanosensory organs that encode inertial forces to aid rapid course correction during flight but serve no aerodynamic role and are specific to two orders of insects (Diptera and Strepsiptera).

110,Extreme impact and cavitation forces of a biological hammer: strike forces of the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus.,"Mantis shrimp are renowned for their unusual method of breaking shells with brief, powerful strikes of their raptorial appendages. Due to the extreme speeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically 390-480 micros apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and acoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the limb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitation forces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on average, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapid succession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells.

In the current study it is shown that the non-neuronal isoform of TDC, Tdc1, is expressed in the principal cells of the MT. A mutant allele of Tdc1, Tdc1(f03311), was identified that reduced expression of the mature Tdc1 transcript by greater than 100-fold.

From a movie obtained using high-speed photography from three orthogonal views of free flight in honeybees, periodic changes of the coupled-wing profile were acquired and further demonstrated that the deformation mechanism is a fundamental property for variable deformed shapes of the wing profile during flapping flight, and, in particular, the flat wing profile achieves a nice transition between downstrokes and upstrokes.

113,Photoreception and vision in the ultraviolet.,"Ultraviolet (UV) light occupies the spectral range of wavelengths slightly shorter than those visible to humans. Because of its shorter wavelength, it is more energetic (and potentially more photodamaging) than 'visible light', and it is scattered more efficiently in air and water. Until 1990, only a few animals were recognized as being sensitive to UV light, but we now know that a great diversity, possibly even the majority, of animal species can visually detect and respond to it. Here, we discuss the history of research on biological UV photosensitivity and review current major research trends in this field. Some animals use their UV photoreceptors to control simple, innate behaviors, but most incorporate their UV receptors into their general sense of vision. They not only detect UV light but recognize it as a separate color in light fields, on natural objects or living organisms, or in signals displayed by conspecifics. UV visual pigments are based on opsins, the same family of proteins that are used to detect light in conventional photoreceptors. Despite some interesting exceptions, most animal species have a single photoreceptor class devoted to the UV. The roles of UV in vision are manifold, from guiding navigation and orientation behavior, to detecting food and potential predators, to supporting high-level tasks such as mate assessment and intraspecific communication. Our current understanding of UV vision is restricted almost entirely to two phyla: arthropods and chordates (specifically, vertebrates), so there is much comparative work to be done.",10.1242/jeb.128769,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27655820/,Photoreception and vision in the ultraviolet,"ABSTRACT Ultraviolet (UV) light occupies the spectral range of wavelengths slightly shorter than those visible to humans.

114,Stimulation by cadmium of myohemerythrin-like cells in the gut of the annelid Nereis diversicolor.,"Isolated guts of Nereis diversicolor revealed the existence of a cadmium-binding protein, the MPII, belonging to the group of hemerythrins and myohemerythrins. The presence of MPII in the cells of the intestine was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, using anti-MPII, a monoclonal antibody. In addition, using in situ hybridization and northern blotting, it was shown that MPII-cells are the site of synthesis of this molecule. Exposure of the worms to cadmium led to the cellular activation process of MPII-cells (i.e. transformation of the nucleolus, development of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus), although MPII mRNA transcript levels were unchanged. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of gut extracts revealed that MPII levels were increased after exposure to Cd, so it appears that this protein is synthesized as a response to Cd exposure without any new synthesis of mRNA. This mechanism of regulation is quite similar to that reported in the case of mammalian ferritin and may be involved in the regulation of Cd levels in this worm.",10.1242/jeb.00858,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14978053/,Stimulation by cadmium of myohemerythrin-like cells in the gut of the annelid Nereis diversicolor,"SUMMARY Isolated guts of Nereis diversicolor revealed the existence of a cadmium-binding protein, the MPII, belonging to the group of hemerythrins and myohemerythrins.

115,Locomotion of lizards on inclines and perches: hindlimb kinematics of an arboreal specialist and a terrestrial generalist.,"Arboreal animals, especially lizards, often traverse three-dimensional networks of narrow perches with variable and steep inclines, but the effects of both incline and narrow surfaces on the locomotor movement and function of limbs are poorly understood. Thus, we quantified the three-dimensional hindlimb kinematics of a specialized arboreal lizard, Chamaeleo calyptratus, moving horizontally, and up and down a 30 degrees incline on a narrow (2.4 cm) perch and a flat surface. We compared the flat-surface data of C. calyptratus with those of an anatomically generalized terrestrial lizard, Dipsosaurus dorsalis. Inclines had significant main effects for relatively few kinematic variables of C. calyptratus (11%) compared to D. dorsalis (73%). For C. calyptratus, the main effects of locomotor surface were nearly three times more widespread than those of incline. The foot of C. calyptratus was markedly anterior to the hip at footfall, primarily as a result of an unusually extended knee for a lizard. A large amount of knee flexion during early stance may be used by C. calyptratus to actively pull the body forward in a manner not found in D. dorsalis. Unexpectedly, the pelvic rotation of C. calyptratus greatly exceeded that of D. dorsalis and, unlike D. dorsalis, was not affected by incline. The more medial location of the foot of C. calyptratus on the narrow perch during stance was primarily a result of knee flexion rather than femur depression.

116,Distance and force production during jumping in wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.,"In many insects renowned for their jumping ability, elastic storage is used so that high forces can be developed prior to jumping. We have combined physiological, behavioural and genetic approaches to test whether elastic energy storage makes a major contribution to jumping in Drosophila. We describe a sensitive strain gauge setup, which measures the forces produced by tethered flies through their mesothoracic legs. The peak force produced by the main jumping muscle of female flies from a wild-type (Canton-S) strain is 101+/-4.4 microN [and this is indistinguishable from a second wild-type (Texas) strain]. The force takes 8.2 ms to reach its peak. The peak force is not affected significantly by altering the leg angle (femur-tibia joint angle) in the range of 75-120 degrees, but the peak force declines as the leg is extended further. Measurements of jumping ability (distance jumped) showed that female Drosophila (with their wings removed) of two wild-type strains, Canton-S and Texas, produced jumps of 28.6+/-0.7 and 30.2+/-1.0 mm (mean +/- s.e.m.). For a female wild-type Drosophila, a jump of 30 mm corresponds to a kinetic energy of 200 nJ on take-off (allowing 20% of the energy to overcome air resistance). We develop equations of motion for a linear force-time model of take-off and calculate that the time to take-off is 5.0 ms and the peak force should be 274 microN (137 microN leg(-1)). We predicted, from the role of octopamine in enhancing muscle tension in several locust muscles, that if stored elastic energy plays no part in force development, then genetic manipulation of the octopaminergic system would directly affect force production and jumping in Drosophila. Using two mutants deficient in the octopaminergic system, TbhnM18 (M18) and TyrRhono (hono), we found significantly reduced jumping distances (20.7+/-0.7 and 20.7+/-0.4 mm, respectively) and force production (52% and 55%, respectively) compared with wild type. From the reduced distance and force production in M18, a mutant deficient in octopamine synthesis, and in hono, a tyramine/octopamine receptor mutant, we conclude that in Drosophila, as in locusts, octopamine modulates escape jumping. We conclude that the fly does not need to store large quantities of elastic energy in order to make its jump because (1) the measured and calculated forces agree to within 40% and (2) the reduction in distances jumped by the mutants correlates well with their reduction in measured peak force.",10.1242/jeb.01181,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15339947/,Distance and force production during jumping in wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster,"SUMMARY In many insects renowned for their jumping ability, elastic storage is used so that high forces can be developed prior to jumping.

118,Intragel oxygen promotes hypoxia tolerance of scyphomedusae.,"Populations of jellyfish are known to thrive in many low oxygen environments, however, the physiological mechanisms that permit these organisms to live in hypoxia remain unknown. The oxyregulatory abilities of four species of scyphomedusae were investigated, and it was found that Aurelia labiata, Phacellophora camtschatica, Cyanea capillata and Chrysaora quinquecirrha maintain steady oxygen consumption to below 20 hPa oxygen (<10% air saturation). Oxygen content of the mesoglea of A. labiata was measured using a fibre optic oxygen optode, and oxygen profiles through the gel are characterised by a gradient that decreases from just below normoxia at the aboral subsurface to approximately 85% air saturation near the subumbrellar musculature. This gradient sustains oxyregulation by scyphomedusae, and it is demonstrated that A. labiata must be using intragel oxygen to meet its metabolic needs. Gel can also be used as an oxygen reservoir when A. labiata moves into hypoxia. Gel oxygen is depleted after about 2 h in anoxia and recovers to 70% of normal after 2.5 h in normoxia. Behaviour experiments in the laboratory showed that Aurelia labiata behaves similarly in normoxia and hypoxia (30% and 18% air saturation).

119,Fluid and osmolyte recovery in the common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis following full-body withdrawal.,"The common pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis sacrifices 40-60% of its extracellular fluid (ECF) including solutes to the surrounding environment to fully retract into its shell. Our objectives were to determine recovery time following such ECF loss and characterize mechanisms involved in recovering Na(+), the primary cationic osmolyte in this snail. Pallial fluid was initially collected post-stimulation and again after a second stimulation on sub-groups of those snails 2 h to 10 weeks after initial sampling. Samples were analyzed for pH, osmotic pressure, and individual solute concentrations. Lost volume was recovered within 8 h with no significant changes in pH or total CO(2). Significant decreases in osmotic pressure, [Na(+)] (43% loss), and [Cl(-)] recovered in 48 h as a result of enhanced uptake from the water. Copper and total extracellular proteins took 5 weeks to recover. Measurements of Na(+) transport kinetics completed before and immediately after fluid loss revealed a near threefold increase in both affinity and capacity of the Na(+) uptake system. Sodium uptake was independent of ambient Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-) in both control and fluid-depleted snails. Amiloride significantly reduced recovery-phase Na(+) uptake rates but did not influence baseline Na(+) flux. Recovery uptake was significantly reduced by amiloride, ethylisopropylamiloride, bafilomycin and ethoxzolamide indicating dependency upon Na(+)/H(+) exchange, H(+) pump activity and H(+) from carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed CO(2) hydration.

120,Natural odor ligands for olfactory receptor neurons of the female mosquito Aedes aegypti: use of gas chromatography-linked single sensillum recordings.,"Female Aedes aegypti are vectors of dengue and yellow fever. Odor volatiles are the predominant cues that drive the host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti. Odorant molecules are detected and discriminated by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in sensory hairs, sensilla, located on the antennae and maxillary palps. In a previous study, we used odor volatiles that are behaviorally and/or electrophysiologically active for Ae. aegypti and other mosquito species to show that antennal ORNs of female Ae. aegypti are divided into functionally different classes. In the present study, we have, for the first time, conducted gas chromatography-coupled single sensillum recordings (GC-SSR) from antennal trichoid and intermediate sensilla of female Ae. aegypti in order to screen for additional putative host attractants and repellents. We used headspace collections from biologically relevant sources, such as different human body parts (including feet, trunk regions and armpit), as well as a plant species used as a mosquito repellent, Nepeta faassenii.

121,Mechanisms of naturally evolved ethanol resistance in Drosophila melanogaster.,"The decaying fruit in which Drosophila melanogaster feed and breed can contain ethanol in concentrations as high as 6-7%. In this cosmopolitan species, populations from temperate regions are consistently more resistant to ethanol poisoning than populations from the tropics, but little is known about the physiological basis of this difference. I show that when exposed to low levels of ethanol vapor, flies from a tropical African population accumulated 2-3 times more internal ethanol than flies from a European population, giving evidence that faster ethanol catabolism by European flies contributes to the resistance difference. Using lines differing only in the origin of their third chromosome, however, I show that faster ethanol elimination cannot fully explain the resistance difference, because relative to African third chromosomes, European third chromosomes confer substantially higher ethanol resistance, while having little effect on internal ethanol concentrations. European third chromosomes also confer higher resistance to acetic acid, a metabolic product of ethanol, than African third chromosomes, suggesting that the higher ethanol resistance conferred by the former might be due to increased resistance to deleterious effects of ethanol-derived acetic acid. In support of this hypothesis, when ethanol catabolism was blocked with an Alcohol dehydrogenase mutant, there was no difference in ethanol resistance between flies with European and African third chromosomes.

122,A surface lipid may control the permeability slump associated with entry into anhydrobiosis in the plant parasitic nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci.,"The anhydrobiotic plant-parasitic nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci undergoes a decrease in permeability (the permeability slump) during the early stages of desiccation and this produces the slow rate of water loss necessary for its survival. There were no changes in annulation spacing, followed in individual nematodes by confocal microscopy, that would account for the permeability slump. Nile Red staining reveals that the surface of the nematode is coated with an extracuticular layer of lipid. This material can be seen in unstained desiccated nematodes where it forms an oil that adheres to the coverslip and to adjacent nematodes. The oily material leaves impressions on the coverslip (cuticle prints) after the nematode has detached upon rehydration. The presence of the surface lipid was confirmed using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. This material was shown to be a triglyceride and the proportion of fatty acids determined, using thin layer and gas chromatography.

By analyzing simultaneous video footage of the tagged jellyfish, we developed ML methods to: (1) identify periods of tag data corrupted by the tether method, which may have compromised prior research findings, and (2) classify jellyfish behaviors. Our tools yield characterizations of fine-scale jellyfish activity and orientation over long durations, and we conclude that it is essential to develop behavioral classifiers on in situ rather than laboratory data.

124,Postprandial increases in nitrogenous excretion and urea synthesis in the giant mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri.,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding on the excretory nitrogen (N) metabolism of the giant mudskipper, Periophthalmodon schlosseri, with special emphasis on the role of urea synthesis in ammonia detoxification. The ammonia and urea excretion rates of P. schlosseri increased 1.70- and 1.92-fold, respectively, within the first 3 h after feeding on guppies. Simultaneously, there were significant decreases in ammonia levels in the plasma and the brain, and in urea contents in the muscle and liver, of P. schlosseri at 3 h post-feeding. Thus, it can be concluded that P. schlosseri was capable of unloading ammonia originally present in some of its tissues in anticipation of ammonia released from the catabolism of excess amino acids after feeding. Subsequently, there were significant increases in urea content in the muscle, liver and plasma (1.39-, 2.17- and 1.62-fold, respectively) at 6 h post-feeding, and the rate of urea synthesis apparently increased 5.8-fold between 3 h and 6 h. Increased urea synthesis might have occurred in the liver of P. schlosseri because the greatest increase in urea content was observed therein. The excess urea accumulated in the body at 6 h was completely excreted between 6 and 12 h, and the percentage of waste-N excreted as urea-N increased significantly to 26% during this period, but never exceeded 50%, the criterion for ureotely, meaning that P. schlosseri remained ammonotelic after feeding. By 24 h, 62.7% of the N ingested by P. schlosseri was excreted, out of which 22.6% was excreted as urea-N.

125,Developmental programming of the adrenocortical stress response by yolk testosterone depends on sex and life history stage.,"Developmental exposure of embryos to maternal hormones such as testosterone (T) in the avian egg influences the expression of multiple traits, with certain effects being sex-specific and lasting into adulthood. This pleiotropy, sex dependency, and persistency may be the consequence of developmental programming of basic systemic processes like adrenocortical activity or metabolic rate. We investigated if experimentally increased in ovo exposure to T influences hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function, i.e. baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (Cort) secretion, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adult male and female House sparrows (Passer domesticus). In previous experiments with this passerine bird we demonstrated effects of embryonic T exposure on adult agonistic and sexual behavior and survival. Here we report that baseline Cort levels and the stress secretion profile of Cort are modified by in ovo T in a sex-specific and life-history stage dependent manner. Compared to controls, males from T-treated eggs had higher baseline Cort levels whereas females from T-treated eggs showed prolonged stress-induced Cort secretion during the reproductive but not the non-reproductive phase. Adult RMR was unaffected by in ovo T-treatment but correlated with integrated Cort stress secretion levels. We conclude that exposure of the embryo to T programs the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in a sex-specific manner that in females depends, in expression, on reproductive state.

126,Warm acclimation and oxygen depletion induce species-specific responses in salmonids.,"Anthropogenic activities are greatly altering the habitats of animals, whereby fish are already encountering several stressors simultaneously. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the capacity of fish to respond to two different environmental stressors (high temperature and overnight hypoxia) separately and together. We found that acclimation to increased temperature (from 7.7±0.02°C to 14.9±0.05°C) and overnight hypoxia (daily changes from normoxia to 63-67% oxygen saturation), simulating climate change and eutrophication, had both antagonistic and synergistic effects on the capacity of fish to tolerate these stressors. The thermal tolerance of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) increased with warm acclimation by 1.3 and 2.2°C, respectively, but decreased when warm temperature was combined with overnight hypoxia (by 0.2 and 0.4°C, respectively). In contrast, the combination of the stressors more than doubled hypoxia tolerance in salmon and also increased hypoxia tolerance in char by 22%. Salmon had 1.2°C higher thermal tolerance than char, but char tolerated much lower oxygen levels than salmon at a given temperature. The changes in hypoxia tolerance were connected to the responses of the oxygen supply and delivery system. The relative ventricle mass was higher in cold- than in warm-acclimated salmon but the thickness of the compact layer of the ventricle increased with the combination of warm and hypoxia acclimation in both species. Char had also significantly larger hearts and thicker compact layers than salmon. The results illustrate that while fish can have protective responses when encountering a single environmental stressor, the combination of stressors can have unexpected species-specific effects that will influence their survival capacity.

129,Zebrafish larvae evade predators by sensing water flow.,"The ability of fish to evade predators is central to the ecology and evolution of a diversity of species. However, it is largely unclear how prey fish detect predators in order to initiate their escape. We tested whether larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) sense the flow created by adult predators of the same species. When placed together in a cylindrical arena, we found that larvae were able to escape 70% of predator strikes (mean escape probability P(escape)=0.7, N=13). However, when we pharmacologically ablated the flow-sensitive lateral line system, larvae were rarely capable of escape (mean P(escape)=0.05, N=11). In order to explore the rapid events that facilitate a successful escape, we recorded freely swimming predators and prey using a custom-built camera dolly. This device permitted two-dimensional camera motion to manually track prey and record their escape response with high temporal and spatial resolution. These recordings demonstrated that prey were more than 3 times more likely to evade a suction-feeding predator if they responded before (P(escape)=0.53, N=43), rather than after (P(escape)=0.15, N=13), a predator's mouth opened, which is a highly significant difference. Therefore, flow sensing plays an essential role in predator evasion by facilitating a response prior to a predator's strike.",10.1242/jeb.072751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23325859/,Zebrafish larvae evade predators by sensing water flow,"SUMMARY The ability of fish to evade predators is central to the ecology and evolution of a diversity of species.

130,Neuromuscular control of trout swimming in a vortex street: implications for energy economy during the Karman gait.,"Approximating the complexity of natural locomotor conditions provides insight into the diversity of mechanisms that enable animals to successfully navigate through their environment. When exposed to vortices shed from a cylinder, fishes hold station by adopting a mode of locomotion called the Kármán gait, whereby the body of the fish displays large, lateral oscillations and the tail-beat frequency matches the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Although field studies indicate that fishes often prefer turbulent flows over uniform currents, the effect of hydrodynamic perturbations on the mechanics, control and energetics of locomotion is still poorly understood. In this study, electromyography is used to measure red and white axial muscle activity for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) holding station in a vortex street. When trout Kármán gait, they show a significantly reduced but still rhythmic pattern of muscle activity compared with that seen when they swim steadily in uniform flow. Specifically, trout selectively activated only their anterior red axial muscles and abandoned the antero-posterior wave of red muscle activity that drives undulatory locomotion in uniform flow. This supports a previously proposed hypothesis that trout are not just swimming in the reduced flow behind a cylinder (drafting). Anterior axial muscle activity was correlated to head amplitude during steady swimming but not during the Kármán gait, indicating that while activation of muscles during the Kármán gait may aid in stability and control, vortices determined overall head motion. Furthermore, anterior red axial muscle activity, the only region of muscle activity shared between both the Kármán gait and steady swimming, had a lower intensity and longer duration during the Kármán gait. At times when paired fins were active during the Kármán gait, there was no axial muscle activity measured, lending support to a passive mechanism of thrust generation in oscillating flows. Comparisons with dead trout towed behind a cylinder confirm this intriguing observation that live trout may temporarily adopt the Kármán gait with no axial muscle activity, revealing paradoxically that at times fish can passively move against turbulent flow. To Kármán gait for prolonged periods, however, trout must adapt to the demands of turbulence by eliciting a shift in neural control strategy. By decoupling motor output both down and across the body, the pattern of rhythmic Kármán gait muscle activity may reflect the entrainment of a central pattern generator to environmental vortices.",10.1242/jeb.01125,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15339945/,Neuromuscular control of trout swimming in a vortex street: implications for energy economy during the Kármán gait,"SUMMARY Approximating the complexity of natural locomotor conditions provides insight into the diversity of mechanisms that enable animals to successfully navigate through their environment.

134,The evolution of micro-cursoriality in mammals.,"In this study we report on the evolution of micro-cursoriality, a unique case of cursoriality in mammals smaller than 1 kg. We obtained new running speed and limb morphology data for two species of elephant-shrews (Elephantulus spp., Macroscelidae) from Namaqualand, South Africa, which we compared with published data for other mammals. Elephantulus maximum running speeds were higher than those of most mammals smaller than 1 kg. Elephantulus also possess exceptionally high metatarsal:femur ratios (1.07) that are typically associated with fast unguligrade cursors. Cursoriality evolved in the Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Carnivora coincident with global cooling and the replacement of forests with open landscapes in the Oligocene and Miocene. The majority of mammal species, though, remained non-cursorial, plantigrade and small (<1 kg). The extraordinary running speed and digitigrady of elephant-shrews was established in the Early Eocene in the earliest macroscelid Prodiacodon, but was probably inherited from Paleocene, Holarctic stem macroscelids. Micro-cursoriality in macroscelids evolved from the plesiomorphic plantigrade foot of the possum-like ancestral mammal earlier than in other mammalian crown groups. Micro-cursoriality evolved first in forests, presumably in response to selection for rapid running speeds facilitated by local knowledge, in order to avoid predators.

136,Metabolism and water loss rate of the haematophagous insect Rhodnius prolixus: effect of starvation and temperature.,"Haematophagous insects suffer big changes in water needs under different levels of starvation. Rhodnius prolixus is the most important haematophagous vector of Chagas disease in the north of South America and a model organism in insect physiology. Although there have been some studies on patterns of gas exchange and metabolic rates, there is little information regarding water loss in R. prolixus. We investigated whether there is any modulation of water loss and metabolic rate under different requirements for saving water. We measured simultaneously CO2 production, water emission and activity in individual insects in real time by open-flow respirometry at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35°C) and post-feeding days (0, 5, 13 and 29).

139,Molecular characterization and expression of the UV opsin in bumblebees: three ommatidial subtypes in the retina and a new photoreceptor organ in the lamina.,"Ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors have been shown to be important for a variety of visual tasks performed by bees, such as orientation, color and polarization vision, yet little is known about their spatial distribution in the compound eye or optic lobe. We cloned and sequenced a UV opsin mRNA transcript from Bombus impatiens head-specific cDNA and, using western blot analysis, detected an eye protein band of approximately 41 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of the encoded opsin. We then characterized UV opsin expression in the retina, ocelli and brain using immunocytochemistry. In the main retina, we found three different ommatidial types with respect to the number of UV opsin-expressing photoreceptor cells, namely ommatidia containing two, one or no UV opsin-immunoreactive cells. We also observed UV opsin expression in the ocelli. These results indicate that the cloned opsin probably encodes the P350 nm pigment, which was previously characterized by physiological recordings. Surprisingly, in addition to expression in the retina and ocelli, we found opsin expression in different parts of the brain. UV opsin immunoreactivity was detected in the proximal rim of the lamina adjacent to the first optic chiasm, which is where studies in other insects have found expression of proteins involved in the circadian clock, period and cryptochrome.

140,An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird.,"The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks.

141,Cardiovascular development in embryos of the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis: effects of chronic and acute hypoxia.,"Chronic hypoxic incubation is a common tool used to address the plasticity of morphological and physiological characteristics during vertebrate development. In this study chronic hypoxic incubation of embryonic American alligators resulted in both morphological (mass) and physiological changes. During normoxic incubation embryonic mass, liver mass and heart mass increased throughout the period of study, while yolk mass fell. Chronic hypoxia (10%O2) resulted in a reduced embryonic mass at 80% and 90% of incubation. This reduction in embryonic mass was accompanied by a relative enlargement of the heart at 80% and 90% of incubation, while relative embryonic liver mass was similar to the normoxic group. Normoxic incubated alligators maintained a constant heart rate during the period of study, while mean arterial pressure rose continuously. Both levels of hypoxic incubation (15% and 10%O2) resulted in a lower mean arterial pressure at 90% of incubation, while heart rate was lower in the 10%O2 group only. Acute (5 min) exposure to 10%O2 in the normoxic group resulted in a biphasic response, with a normotensive bradycardia occurring during the period of exposure and a hypertensive tachycardic response occurring during recovery. The embryos incubated under hypoxia also showed a blunted response to acute hypoxic stress.

Half of the sensillar neurons of solanaceous-reared larvae were 'tuned' to indioside D, whereas those of wheat germ diet-reared larvae were not.

143,Functional characterisation of the Anopheles leucokinins and their cognate G-protein coupled receptor.,"Identification of the Anopheles gambiae leucokinin gene from the completed A. gambiae genome revealed that this insect species contains three leucokinin peptides, named Anopheles leucokinin I-III. These peptides are similar to those identified in two other mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Culex salinarius. Additionally, Anopheles leucokinin I displays sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogaster leucokinin. Using a combination of computational and molecular approaches, a full-length cDNA for a candidate leucokinin-like receptor was isolated from A. stephensi, a close relative of A. gambiae. Alignment of the known leucokinin receptors--all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)--with this receptor, identified some key conserved regions within the receptors, notably transmembrane (TM) domains I, II, III, VI and VII. The Anopheles leucokinins and receptor were shown to be a functional receptor-ligand pair. All three Anopheles leucokinins caused a dose-dependent rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) when applied to S2 cells co-expressing the receptor and an aequorin transgene, with a potency order of I>II>III. Drosophila leucokinin was also found to activate the Anopheles receptor with a similar EC50 value to Anopheles leucokinin I. However, when the Anopheles peptides were applied to the Drosophila receptor, only Anopheles leucokinin I and II elicited a rise in [Ca2+]i. This suggests that the Anopheles receptor has a broader specificity for leucokinin ligands than the Drosophila receptor. Antisera raised against the Anopheles receptor identified a doublet of approx. 65 and 72 kDa on western blots, consistent with the presence of four N-glycosylation sites within the receptor sequence, and the known glycosylation of the receptor in Drosophila. In Anopheles tubules, as in Drosophila, the receptor was localised to the stellate cells. Thus we provide the first identification of Anopheles mosquito leucokinins (Anopheles leucokinins) and a cognate leucokinin receptor, characterise their interaction and show that Dipteran leucokinin signalling is closely conserved between Drosophila and Anopheles.",10.1242/jeb.01317,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579553/,Functional characterisation of the Anopheles leucokinins and their cognate G-protein coupled receptor,"SUMMARY Identification of the Anopheles gambiae leucokinin gene from the completed A. gambiae genome revealed that this insect species contains three leucokinin peptides, named Anopheles leucokinin I-III.

144,Feel the light: sight-independent negative phototactic response in octopus arms.,"Controlling the octopus's flexible hyper-redundant body is a challenging task. It is assumed that the octopus has poor proprioception which has driven the development of unique mechanisms for efficient body control. Here we report on such a mechanism: a phototactic response of extraocular photoreception. Extraocular photoreception has been observed in many and diverse species. Previous research on cephalopods revealed that increased illumination on their skin evokes chromatophore expansion. Recently, the mechanism was investigated and has been termed 'light-activated chromatophore expansion' (LACE). In this work we show that in response to illumination, the arm tip reacts in a reflex-like manner, folding in and moving away from the light beam. We performed a set of behavioral experiments and surgical manipulations to elucidate and characterize this phototactic response. We found that in contrast to the local activation and control of LACE, the phototactic response is mediated by the brain, although it is expressed in a reflex-like pattern. Our research results and observations led us to propose that the phototaxis is a means for protecting the arms in an instinctive manner from potential daytime predators such as fish and crabs, that could identify the worm-like tips as food. Indeed, observations of the octopuses revealed that their arm tips are folded in during the daytime, whereas at night they are extended. Thus, the phototactic response might compensate for the octopus's poor proprioception by keeping their arms folded in illuminated areas, without the need to be aware of their state.",10.1242/jeb.237529,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33536305/,Feel the light: sight-independent negative phototactic response in octopus arms,"ABSTRACT Controlling the octopus's flexible hyper-redundant body is a challenging task.

145,The influence of beacon-aiming on the routes of wood ants.,"Many insects have an innate propensity to approach conspicuous objects. We explore how such beacon aiming determines the shape of a wood ant's habitual route. We find that a single large black cylinder within an arena biases the route taken by ants as they run from a start position at one end of the arena to reach a feeder at the other. Ants learn a stable route with the first segment of their trajectory aimed at the cylinder, which becomes an intermediate goal on the way to the feeder. When in occasional tests the cylinder is removed or displaced, ants head for the usual site of the cylinder. They also aim for the same site when the cylinder is removed and the ant's normal start position is changed. This behaviour suggests that visual features of the arena are learnt from the vantage point of the cylinder and that this stored snapshot guides the ant to that site. Ants thus reinforce their ability to reach the cylinder by learning other visual features in their surroundings that can also steer them to its location. The use of beacon aiming in fixing routes has several benefits. Because the same path will be traversed on every trial, beacon aiming facilitates the acquisition of routes. Beacon aiming also increases the robustness of learnt routes: ants straying from the route will be attracted to the closest beacon and so regain their habitual paths.",10.1242/jeb.00115,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12502774/,The influence of beacon-aiming on the routes of wood ants,"SUMMARY Many insects have an innate propensity to approach conspicuous objects.

147,Increased glucocorticoid concentrations in early life cause mitochondrial inefficiency and short telomeres.,"Telomeres are DNA structures that protect chromosome ends. However, telomeres shorten during cell replication and at critically low lengths can reduce cell replicative potential, induce cell senescence and decrease fitness. Stress exposure, which elevates glucocorticoid hormone concentrations, can exacerbate telomere attrition. This phenomenon has been attributed to increased oxidative stress generated by glucocorticoids ('oxidative stress hypothesis'). We recently suggested that glucocorticoids could increase telomere attrition during stressful periods by reducing the resources available for telomere maintenance through changes in the metabolic machinery ('metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis'). Here we tested whether experimental increases in glucocorticoid levels affected telomere length and mitochondrial function in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings during the energy-demanding early growth. We monitored resulting corticosterone (Cort) concentrations in plasma, and in red blood cells, telomere lengths and mitochondrial metabolism (metabolic rate, proton leak, oxidative phosphorylation, maximal mitochondrial capacity and mitochondrial inefficiency). We assessed oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolites as well as the total non-enzymatic antioxidant protection in plasma. Compared with control (Ctrl) nestlings, Cort-nestlings had higher baseline corticosterone, shorter telomeres and higher mitochondrial metabolic rate. Importantly, Cort-nestlings showed increased mitochondrial proton leak, leading to a decreased ATP production efficiency. Treatment groups did not differ in oxidative damage or antioxidants. Hence, glucocorticoid-induced telomere attrition is associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism, but not with ROS production. These findings support the hypothesis that shortening of telomere length during stressful periods is mediated by glucocorticoids through metabolic rearrangements.",10.1242/jeb.222513,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34005572/,Increased glucocorticoid concentrations in early life cause mitochondrial inefficiency and short telomeres.,"Telomeres are DNA structures that protect chromosome ends.

The critical oxygen partial pressure (Pcrit), the PO2 below which oxygen supply cannot match basal demand, is a commonly reported index of hypoxia tolerance. Any CO2-induced reduction in oxygen supply should be apparent as an increase in Pcrit. In this study, we assessed the effects of CO2 (46–143 Pa; 455–1410 μatm) on the metabolic rate and Pcrit of two squid species – Dosidicus gigas and Doryteuthis pealeii – through manipulative experiments. We also developed a model, with inputs for hemocyanin pH sensitivity, blood PCO2 and buffering capacity, that simulates blood oxygen supply under varying seawater CO2 partial pressures. We compare model outputs with measured Pcrit in squid. Using blood–O2 parameters from the literature for model inputs, we estimated that, in the absence of blood acid–base regulation, an increase in seawater PCO2 to 100 Pa (≈1000 μatm) would result in a maximum drop in arterial hemocyanin–O2 saturation by 1.6% at normoxia and a Pcrit increase of ≈0.5 kPa. Our live-animal experiments support this supposition, as CO2 had no effect on measured metabolic rate or Pcrit in either squid species.

149,Escape manoeuvres in the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias).,"The locomotor performance of dogfish during escape responses was observed by means of high-speed video. Dogfish show C-type escape responses that are comparable with those shown previously in teleosts. Dogfish show high variability of turning rates of the anterior part of the body (head to centre of mass), i.e. with peak values from 434 to 1023 deg. s(-1). We suggest that this variability may be due to the presence of two types of escape manoeuvres, i.e. responses with high and low turning rates, as previously found in a teleost species. Fast responses (i.e. with high maximum turning rates, ranging between 766 and 1023 deg. s(-1)) showed significantly higher locomotor performance than slow responses (i.e. with low maximum turning rates, ranging between 434 and 593 deg. s(-1)) in terms of distance covered, speed and acceleration, although no differences were found in the turning radius of the centre of mass during the escape manoeuvres. The existence of two types of escape responses would have implications in terms of both neural control and muscular activation patterns. When compared with literature data for the locomotor performance of bony fishes, dogfish showed relatively low speed and acceleration, comparable turning rates and a turning radius that is in the low part of the range when compared with teleosts, indicating relatively high manoeuvrability.

151,"Control of discontinuous gas exchange in Samia cynthia: effects of atmospheric oxygen, carbon dioxide and moisture.","The evolution of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in insects is highly controversial. Adaptive hypotheses which have obtained experimental support include a water savings mechanism for living in dry environments (hygric hypothesis), a reduction in oxidative damage due to a high-performance oxygen delivery system (oxidative damage hypothesis), and the need for steep intratracheal partial pressure gradients to exchange gases under the hypercapnic and/or hypoxic conditions potentially encountered in subterranean environments (chthonic hypothesis). However, few experimental studies have simultaneously assessed multiple competing hypotheses within a strong inference framework. Here, we present such a study at the species level for a diapausing moth pupa, Samia cynthia. Switching gas conditions from controlled normoxic, normocapnic and intermediate humidity to either high or low oxygen, high or low moisture, elevated carbon dioxide, or some combination of these, revealed that DGE was abandoned under all conditions except high oxygen, and high or low gas moisture levels. Thus, support is found for the oxidative damage hypothesis when scored as maintenance of DGE. Modulation of DGE under either dry or hyperoxic conditions suggested strong support for the oxidative damage hypothesis and some limited support for the hygric hypothesis. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the DGE can be maintained and modulated in response to several environmental variables.

152,Jamming avoidance response of big brown bats in target detection.,"When searching for prey, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) enhance the range of their sonar by concentrating more energy in the nearly constant-frequency (CF) tail portion of their frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. We hypothesize that this portion of their signals may be vulnerable to interference from conspecifics using the same frequencies in their own emissions. To determine how bats modify their signals when confronted with an interfering stimulus, we compared the echolocation calls of bats when a CF jamming tone was on and off. The bats performed a two-alternative forced-choice detection task in the laboratory that required the use of echolocation.

153,Gestation increases the energetic cost of breathing in the lizard Tiliqua rugosa.,"High gestational loads result in fetuses that occupy a large proportion of the body cavity and may compress maternal organs. Compression of the lungs results in alterations in breathing patterns during gestation, which may affect the energetic cost of breathing. In this study, the energetic cost of breathing during gestation was determined in the viviparous skink Tiliqua rugosa. Radiographic imaging showed progressive lung compression during gestation and a 30% reduction in the lung inflation index (rib number at which the caudal margin of the lung was imaged divided by total rib number). Pneumotachography and open flow respirometry were used to measure breathing patterns and metabolic rates. Gestation induced a twofold increase in minute ventilation via increases in breathing frequency, but no change in inspired tidal volume. The rates of O(2) consumption and CO(2) production did not change significantly during gestation. Together, these results suggest that a relative hyperventilation occurs during gestation in T. rugosa, which in turn suggests that diffusion and/or perfusion limitations may exist at the lung during gestation. The energetic cost of breathing was estimated as a percentage of resting metabolic rate using hypercapnia to stimulate ventilation at different stages of pregnancy. The energetic cost of breathing in non-pregnant lizards was 19.96±3.85% of resting metabolic rate and increased threefold to 62.80±10.11% during late gestation. This significant increase in the energetic cost of breathing may have significant consequences for energy budgets during gestation.",10.1242/jeb.067827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22972896/,Gestation increases the energetic cost of breathing in the lizard Tiliqua rugosa,"SUMMARY High gestational loads result in fetuses that occupy a large proportion of the body cavity and may compress maternal organs.

Instead, there exists a unique family of noncollagenous structural proteins, the significance of which is not completely understood. A custom-built uniaxial testing apparatus was used to quantify and compare equilibrium stress-relaxation behavior (equilibrium moduli, stress decay behavior, recovery times and relaxation times) of (1) lamprey pericardial cartilages with perichondria tested in tension (young adult and aged), (2) annular cartilages without perichondria tested in compression (young adult and aged) and (3) bovine auricular cartilage samples without perichondria tested in both tension and compression. Results of this study demonstrated that all cartilages were highly viscoelastic but with varying relaxation times; approximately 120 min for annular and pericardial cartilages and 30 min for bovine auricular cartilages. For mean equilibrium moduli, young adult lamprey annular cartilages (0.71 MPa) and pericardial cartilages (2.87 MPa) were found to be statistically different. The mean moduli of all bovine auricular cartilages were statistically identical to lamprey cartilages except in the case of aged adult pericardial cartilages, which were statistically larger than all other cartilages at 4.85 MPa.

155,In vivo muscle function vs speed. I. Muscle strain in relation to length change of the muscle-tendon unit.,"The activity of muscles can be concentric (shortening), eccentric (lengthening) or isometric (constant length). When studying muscle function it is important to know what the muscle fascicles are actually doing because the performance of muscle is strongly influenced by the type of activity: force decreases as a function of shortening velocity during concentric contractions; force produced during eccentric contractions can be stronger than maximum isometric force, and force production is enhanced if a concentric contraction follows an eccentric phase. It is well known that length changes of muscle fascicles may be different from length changes of the overall muscle-tendon unit because of the compliance of the series elasticity. Consequently, fascicles of joint extensor muscles may not undergo eccentric activity even when the joint flexes, but the extent to which this occurs may vary with the compliance of the series elasticity and may differ between species: the vastus lateralis, a knee extensor, shortens when active during trotting in dogs and lengthens in rats. Previous studies of kinematics of trotting in horses have shown that during stance, the elbow extends nearly continuously with a brief period of flexion near mid-stance and the knee exhibits two phases of flexion followed by extension. The lateral triceps (an elbow extensor) has no external tendon but the vastus lateralis has a relatively long external tendon and the fascicles insert on an aponeurosis. Thus, one might expect the relation between fascicle strain and overall length change of the muscle-tendon units to be quite different in these two muscles. In the present study in horses, fascicle length changes of the lateral triceps and vastus lateralis were measured with sonomicrometry and length changes of the muscle-tendon units were estimated from muscle architecture and joint kinematics for four horses trotting on a treadmill at nine speeds. Because the focus of this study was the relation between length changes of the muscle-tendon unit (estimated from kinematics) and length changes in the muscle fascicles, we divided the stance-phase sonomicrometry records into phases that corresponded to the alternating flexion and extension of the joint as indicated by the kinematic records. During its one eccentric phase, the triceps shortened by 0.7+/-0.4% despite a predicted lengthening of 1%. Similarly, the vastus shortened by 3.7+/-1.9% when kinematics predicted 3.2% lengthening. During their concentric phases the triceps shortened by 10.6% and the vastus shortened by 8.1%. Strain in the triceps did not change with speed but it did in the vastus. Strain rate increased with speed in both muscles as did the integrated EMG, indicating an increase in the volume of muscle recruited.

157,Form and metabolic scaling in colonial animals.,"Benthic colonial organisms exhibit a wide variation in size and shape and provide excellent model systems for testing the predictions of models that describe the scaling of metabolic rate with organism size. We tested the hypothesis that colony form will influence metabolic scaling and its derivatives by characterising metabolic and propagule production rates in three species of freshwater bryozoans that vary in morphology and module organisation and which demonstrate two- and three-dimensional growth forms. The results were evaluated with respect to predictions from two models for metabolic scaling. Isometric metabolic scaling in two-dimensional colonies supported predictions of a model based on dynamic energy budget theory (DEB) and not those of a model based on fractally branching supply networks. This metabolic isometry appears to be achieved by equivalent energy budgets of edge and central modules, in one species (Cristatella mucedo) via linear growth and in a second species (Lophopus crystallinus) by colony fission. Allometric scaling characterised colonies of a three-dimensional species (Fredericella sultana), also providing support for the DEB model. Isometric scaling of propagule production rates for C. mucedo and F. sultana suggests that the number of propagules produced in colonies increases in direct proportion with the number of modules within colonies. Feeding currents generated by bryozoans function in both food capture and respiration, thus linking metabolic scaling with dynamics of self-shading and resource capture. Metabolic rates fundamentally dictate organismal performance (e.g. growth, reproduction) and, as we show here, are linked with colony form.

Summary: Force enhancement and force depression are reduced in muscles from mice with a deletion in N2A titin, suggesting that titin plays a role in history-dependent muscle properties that contribute to natural movements."
160,Molecular identification of candidate chemoreceptor genes and signal transduction components in the sensory epithelium of Aplysia.,"An ability to sense and respond to environmental cues is essential to the survival of most marine animals. How water-borne chemical cues are detected at the molecular level and processed by molluscs is currently unknown. In this study, we cloned two genes from the marine mollusk Aplysia dactylomela which encode multi-transmembrane proteins. We have performed in situ hybridization that reveals expression and spatial distribution within the long-distance chemosensory organs, the rhinophores. This finding suggests that they could be receptors involved in binding water-borne chemicals and coupling to an intracellular signal pathway. In support of this, we found expression of a phospholipase C and an inositol trisphosphate receptor in the rhinophore sensory epithelia and possibly distributed within outer dendrites of olfactory sensory neurons. In Aplysia, mate attraction and subsequent reproduction is initiated by responding to a cocktail of water-borne protein pheromones released by animal conspecifics. We show that the rhinophore contraction in response to pheromone stimulants is significantly altered following phospholipase C inhibition. Overall, these data provide insight into the molecular components of chemosensory detection in a mollusk. An important next step will be the elucidation of how these coordinate the detection of chemical cues present in the marine environment and activation of sensory neurons.",10.1242/jeb.026427,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19525430/,Molecular identification of candidate chemoreceptor genes and signal transduction components in the sensory epithelium of Aplysia,"SUMMARY An ability to sense and respond to environmental cues is essential to the survival of most marine animals.

161,Prolactin regulates luminal bicarbonate secretion in the intestine of the sea bream (Sparus aurata L.).,"The pituitary hormone prolactin is a pleiotropic endocrine factor that plays a major role in the regulation of ion balance in fish, with demonstrated actions mainly in the gills and kidney. The role of prolactin in intestinal ion transport remains little studied. In marine fish, which have high drinking rates, epithelial bicarbonate secretion in the intestine produces luminal carbonate aggregates believed to play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. The present study was designed to establish the putative role of prolactin in the regulation of intestinal bicarbonate secretion in a marine fish. Basolateral addition of prolactin to the anterior intestine of sea bream mounted in Ussing chambers caused a rapid (<20 min) decrease of bicarbonate secretion measured by pH-stat. A clear inhibitory dose-response curve was obtained, with a maximal inhibition of 60-65% of basal bicarbonate secretion. The threshold concentration of prolactin for a significant effect on bicarbonate secretion was 10 ng ml(-1), which is comparable with putative plasma levels in seawater fish. The effect of prolactin on apical bicarbonate secretion was independent of the generation route for bicarbonate, as shown in a preparation devoid of basolateral HCO(3)(-)/CO(2) buffer.

162,Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica.,"Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother-offspring environments did not match.

163,Cadmium-induced apoptosis in oyster hemocytes involves disturbance of cellular energy balance but no mitochondrial permeability transition.,"Exposure to environmentally prevalent heavy metals such as cadmium can have detrimental effects on a variety of commercially and ecologically important species such as oysters. Since Cd(2+) is known to induce apoptosis in immune cells of vertebrates, we have investigated the effects of this metal on isolated oyster hemocytes, the main cellular immune defense in mollusks. Enhanced apoptosis of these cells could conceivably create immunosuppressed conditions in these organisms and result in reduced disease resistance and increased opportunistic infection, resulting in decline of their populations. Cd(2+) exposure induced apoptosis in oyster hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 10-100 micromol l(-1), as indicated by the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. At higher concentrations (200-1000 micromol l(-1)), there was no further increase in apoptosis but a significant increase in the level of necrosis. In stark contrast to vertebrate immune cells, there was no decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential or activation of caspases in response to Cd(2+) in the apoptotic range. Surprisingly, Cd(2+) exposure in this range did cause a significant decrease in intracellular ATP levels, indicating a severe disturbance of energy metabolism. Similarly, Cd(2+) exposure of isolated mitochondria resulted in partial uncoupling of mitochondria but no difference in mitochondrial membrane potential. The results demonstrate that the important environmental pollutant Cd(2+) induces apoptosis in oyster immune cells and does so through a mitochondria/caspase-independent pathway, suggesting that a novel, perhaps ancient, apoptotic pathway is active in these cells. Furthermore, it appears that the observed decrease in ATP production during apoptosis is not due to the loss of the mitochondrial proton-motive force but is more likely to be due to inhibition of the F(0)/F(1)-ATPase and/or mitochondrial ADP/ATP or substrate transport.",10.1242/jeb.01152,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15326213/,Cadmium-induced apoptosis in oyster hemocytes involves disturbance of cellular energy balance but no mitochondrial permeability transition,"SUMMARY Exposure to environmentally prevalent heavy metals such as cadmium can have detrimental effects on a variety of commercially and ecologically important species such as oysters.

166,"Neuromuscular control of hovering wingbeat kinematics in response to distinct flight challenges in the ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris.","While producing one of the highest sustained mass-specific power outputs of any vertebrate, hovering hummingbirds must also precisely modulate the activity of their primary flight muscles to vary wingbeat kinematics and modulate lift production. Although recent studies have begun to explore how pectoralis (the primary downstroke muscle) neuromuscular activation and wingbeat kinematics are linked in hummingbirds, it is unclear whether different species modulate these features in similar ways, or consistently in response to distinct flight challenges. In addition, little is known about how the antagonist, the supracoracoideus, is modulated to power the symmetrical hovering upstroke. We obtained simultaneous recordings of wingbeat kinematics and electromyograms from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus in ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) hovering under the following conditions: (1) ambient air, (2) air density reduction trials, (3) submaximal load-lifting trials and (4) maximal load-lifting trials. Increased power output was achieved through increased stroke amplitude during air density reduction and load-lifting trials, but wingbeat frequency only increased at low air densities. Overall, relative electromyographic (EMG) intensity was the best predictor of stroke amplitude and is correlated with angular velocity of the wingtip. The relationship between muscle activation intensity and kinematics was independent of treatment type, indicating that reduced drag on the wings in hypodense air did not lead to high wingtip angular velocities independently of increased muscle work. EMG bursts consistently began and ended before muscle shortening under all conditions. During all sustained hovering, spike number per burst consistently averaged 1.2 in the pectoralis and 2.0 in the supracoracoideus. The number of spikes increased to 2.5-3 in both muscles during maximal load-lifting trials. Despite the relative kinematic symmetry of the hovering downstroke and upstroke, the supracoracoideus was activated ~1 ms earlier, EMG bursts were longer (~0.9 ms) and they exhibited 1.6 times as many spikes per burst. We hypothesize that earlier and more sustained activation of the supracoracoideus fibres is necessary to offset the greater compliance resulting from the presence of the supracoracoid tendon.

Despite the relative kinematic symmetry of the hovering downstroke and upstroke, the supracoracoideus was activated ~1 ms earlier, EMG bursts were longer (~0.9 ms) and they exhibited 1.6 times as many spikes per burst. We hypothesize that earlier and more sustained activation of the supracoracoideus fibres is necessary to offset the greater compliance resulting from the presence of the supracoracoid tendon.",True,"While producing one of the highest sustained mass-specific power outputs of any vertebrate, hovering hummingbirds must also precisely modulate the activity of their primary flight muscles to vary wingbeat kinematics and modulate lift production. Although recent studies have begun to explore how pectoralis (the primary downstroke muscle) neuromuscular activation and wingbeat kinematics are linked in hummingbirds, it is unclear whether different species modulate these features in similar ways, or consistently in response to distinct flight challenges. In addition, little is known about how the antagonist, the supracoracoideus, is modulated to power the symmetrical hovering upstroke. We obtained simultaneous recordings of wingbeat kinematics and electromyograms from the pectoralis and supracoracoideus in ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) hovering under the following conditions: (1) ambient air, (2) air density reduction trials, (3) submaximal load-lifting trials and (4) maximal load-lifting trials. Increased power output was achieved through increased stroke amplitude during air density reduction and load-lifting trials, but wingbeat frequency only increased at low air densities. Overall, relative electromyographic (EMG) intensity was the best predictor of stroke amplitude and is correlated with angular velocity of the wingtip. The relationship between muscle activation intensity and kinematics was independent of treatment type, indicating that reduced drag on the wings in hypodense air did not lead to high wingtip angular velocities independently of increased muscle work. EMG bursts consistently began and ended before muscle shortening under all conditions. During all sustained hovering, spike number per burst consistently averaged 1.2 in the pectoralis and 2.0 in the supracoracoideus. The number of spikes increased to 2.5–3 in both muscles during maximal load-lifting trials.

167,The early ontogeny of neuronal nitric oxide synthase systems in the zebrafish.,"To examine a putative role for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in early vertebrate development we investigated nNOS mRNA expression and cGMP production during development of the zebrafish Danio rerio. The nNOS mRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery showed a distinct spatio-temporal pattern in developing zebrafish embryo and young larvae. nNOS mRNA expression was first detected at 19 h postfertilisation (h.p.f.), in a bilateral subpopulation of the embryonic ventrorostral cell cluster in the forebrain. The number of nNOS mRNA-expressing cells in the brain slowly increased, also appearing in the ventrocaudal cell cluster from about 26 h.p.f., and in the dorsorostral and hindbrain cell cluster and in the medulla at 30 h.p.f. A major increase in nNOS mRNA expression started at about 40 h.p.f., and by 55 h.p.f. the expression constituted cell populations in differentiated central nuclei and in association with the proliferation zones of the brain, and in the medulla and retina. In parts of the skin, nNOS mRNA expression started at 20 h.p.f. and ended at 55 h.p.f. Between 40 and 55 h.p.f., nNOS mRNA expression started in peripheral organs, forming distinct populations after hatching within or in the vicinity of the presumptive swim bladder, enteric ganglia, and along the alimentary tract and nephritic ducts.

As the number of clicks in the reply increases so the interval between clicks decreases; the female fits her entire reply within a critical time window following the male's call.

170,"Measuring individual locomotor rhythms in honey bees, paper wasps and other similar-sized insects.","Circadian rhythms in social insects are highly plastic and are modulated by multiple factors. In addition, complex behaviors such as sun-compass orientation and time learning are clearly regulated by the circadian system in these organisms. Despite these unique features of social insect clocks, the mechanisms as well as the functional and evolutionary relevance of these traits remain largely unknown.

171,Fluid dynamics of feeding behaviour in white-spotted bamboo sharks.,"Although the motor control of feeding is presumed to be generally conserved, some fishes are capable of modulating the feeding behaviour in response to prey type and or prey size. This led to the 'feeding modulation hypothesis', which states that rapid suction strikes are pre-programmed stereotyped events that proceed to completion once initiated regardless of sensory input. If this hypothesis holds true, successful strikes should be indistinguishable from unsuccessful strikes owing to a lack of feedback control in specialized suction feeding fishes. The hydrodynamics of suction feeding in white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) was studied in three behaviours: successful strikes, intraoral transports of prey and unsuccessful strikes. The area of the fluid velocity region around the head of feeding sharks was quantified using time-resolved digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The maximal size of the fluid velocity region is 56% larger in successful strikes than unsuccessful strikes (10.79 cm2 vs 6.90 cm2), but they do not differ in duration, indicating that strikes are modulated based on some aspect of the prey or simply as a result of decreased effort on the part of the predator. The hydrodynamic profiles of successful and unsuccessful strikes differ after 21 ms, a period probably too short to provide time to react through feedback control. The predator-to-prey distance is larger in missed strikes compared with successful strikes, indicating that insufficient suction is generated to compensate for the increased distance. An accuracy index distinguishes unsuccessful strikes (-0.26) from successful strikes (0.45 to 0.61). Successful strikes occur primarily between the horizontal axis of the mouth and the dorsal boundary of the ingested parcel of water, and missed prey are closer to the boundary or beyond.

174,How to make a sexy snake: estrogen activation of female sex pheromone in male red-sided garter snakes.,"Vertebrates indicate their genetic sex to conspecifics using secondary sexual signals, and signal expression is often activated by sex hormones. Among vertebrate signaling modalities, the least is known about how hormones influence chemical signaling. Our study species, the red-sided garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), is a model vertebrate for studying hormonal control of chemical signals because males completely rely on the female sex pheromone to identify potential mates among thousands of individuals. How sex hormones can influence the expression of this crucial sexual signal is largely unknown. We created two groups of experimental males for the first experiment: Sham (blank implants) and E2 (17β-estradiol implants). E2 males were vigorously courted by wild males in outdoor bioassays, and in a Y-maze E2 pheromone trails were chosen by wild males over those of small females and were indistinguishable from large female trails. Biochemically, the E2 pheromone blend was similar to that of large females, and it differed significantly from Shams. For the second experiment, we implanted males with 17β-estradiol in 2007 but removed the implants the following year (2008; Removal).

Among vertebrate signaling modalities, the least is known about how hormones influence chemical signaling. Our study species, the red-sided garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), is a model vertebrate for studying hormonal control of chemical signals because males completely rely on the female sex pheromone to identify potential mates among thousands of individuals.

We created two groups of experimental males for the first experiment: Sham (blank implants) and E2 (17β-estradiol implants). E2 males were vigorously courted by wild males in outdoor bioassays, and in a Y-maze E2 pheromone trails were chosen by wild males over those of small females and were indistinguishable from large female trails.

175,Activation patterns of the tongue-projector muscle during feeding in the imperial cave salamander Hydromantes imperialis.,"Salamanders of the genus Hydromantes project their tongues the greatest distance of any amphibian to capture prey, up to 80% of body length or approximately 6 cm in an adult individual. During tongue projection on distant prey, the tongue is shot ballistically and the tongue skeleton leaves the body of the salamander entirely. We investigated an aspect of the motor control of this remarkable behavior by examining electromyographic patterns within different regions of the tongue-projector muscle, the subarcualis rectus (SAR). SAR activation is strongly modulated, and features of this modulation can be predicted by tongue-projection distance (i.e. prey distance). The strap-like buccal portion of the SAR is always activated first and for the longest duration, compared to any other region. It is in a position to transmit force generated by the posterior SAR to the floor of the mouth, where it originates. The posterior SAR encompasses and applies force to the epibranchial of the tongue skeleton, and its activation pattern gradually changes from a posterior-to-anterior wave of activation onset during short-distance projection to an all-at-once pattern during the most extreme long-distance (ballistic) projection. The duration of activity and EMG area of each recorded region of the SAR increase with increasing prey distance, showing greater muscle recruitment during long-distance projection.

177,The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications.,"It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo® 'shark skin-like' swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles.

180,Point of no return in diving emperor penguins: is the timing of the decision to return limited by the number of strokes?,"At some point in a dive, breath-hold divers must decide to return to the surface to breathe. The issue of when to end a dive has been discussed intensively in terms of foraging ecology and behavioral physiology, using dive duration as a temporal parameter. Inevitably, however, a time lag exists between the decision of animals to start returning to the surface and the end of the dive, especially in deep dives. In the present study, we examined the decision time in emperor penguins under two different conditions: during foraging trips at sea and during dives at an artificial isolated dive hole. It was found that there was an upper limit for the decision-to-return time irrespective of dive depth in birds diving at sea. However, in a large proportion of dives at the isolated dive hole, the decision-to-return time exceeded the upper limit at sea. This difference between the decision times in dives at sea versus the isolated dive hole was accounted for by a difference in stroke rate. The stroke rates were much lower in dives at the isolated hole and were inversely correlated with the upper limit of decision times in individual birds. Unlike the decision time to start returning, the cumulative number of strokes at the decision time fell within a similar range in the two experiments. This finding suggests that the number of strokes, but not elapsed time, constrained the decision of emperor penguins to return to the surface.

182,Drinking problems on a 'simple' diet: physiological convergence in nectar-feeding birds.,"Regulation of energy and water are by necessity closely linked in avian nectarivores, because the easily available sugars in nectar are accompanied by an excess of water but few electrolytes. In general, there is convergence in morphology and physiology between three main lineages of avian nectarivores that have evolved on different continents - the hummingbirds, sunbirds and honeyeaters. These birds show similar dependence of sugar preferences on nectar concentration, high intestinal sucrase activity and rapid absorption of hexoses via mediated and paracellular routes. There are differences, however, in how these lineages deal with energy challenges, as well as processing the large volumes of preformed water ingested in nectar. While hummingbirds rely on varying renal water reabsorption, the passerine nectarivores modulate intestinal water absorption during water loading, thus reducing the impact on the kidneys. Hummingbirds do not generally cope with salt loading, and have renal morphology consistent with their ability to produce copious dilute urine; by contrast, as well as being able to deal with dilute diets, honeyeaters and sunbirds are more than capable of dealing with moderately high levels of added electrolytes.

While hummingbirds rely on varying renal water reabsorption, the passerine nectarivores modulate intestinal water absorption during water loading, thus reducing the impact on the kidneys. Hummingbirds do not generally cope with salt loading, and have renal morphology consistent with their ability to produce copious dilute urine; by contrast, as well as being able to deal with dilute diets, honeyeaters and sunbirds are more than capable of dealing with moderately high levels of added electrolytes. And finally, in response to energy challenge, hummingbirds readily resort to torpor, while the passerines show renal and digestive responses that allow them to deal with short-term fasts and rapidly restore energy balance without using torpor. In conclusion, sunbirds and honeyeaters demonstrate a degree of physiological plasticity in dealing with digestive and renal challenges of their nectar diet, while hummingbirds appear to be more constrained by this diet."
183,Development of vocalization and hearing in American mink (Neovison vison).,"American mink (Neovison vison) kits are born altricial and fully dependent on maternal care, for which the kits' vocalizations appear essential. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to determine: (1) hearing sensitivity of adult females from two breeding lines known to differ in maternal behaviour and (2) development of hearing in kits 8-52 days of age. We also studied sound production in 20 kits throughout postnatal days 1 to 44. Adult female mink had a broad hearing range from 1 kHz to above 70 kHz, with peak sensitivity (threshold of 20 dB SPL) at 8-10 kHz, and no difference in sensitivity between the two breeding lines (P>0.22) to explain the difference in maternal care. Mink kits showed no signs of hearing up to postnatal day 24. From day 30, all kits had ABRs indicative of hearing. Hearing sensitivity increased with age, but was still below the adult level at postnatal day 52. When separated from their mothers, kits vocalized loudly. Until the age of 22 days, 90% of all kits vocalized with no significant decline with age (P=0.27). From day 25, concurrent with the start of hearing, the number of vocalizing kits decreased with age (P<0.001), in particular in kits that were re-tested (P=0.004). Large numbers of mink are kept in fur industry farms, and our results are important to the understanding of sound communication, which is part of their natural behaviour.

185,Interactions between detoxification mechanisms and excretion in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster.,"Insects have long been known to excrete toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. In addition, exposure to natural or synthetic toxins is commonly associated with increases in the activity of detoxification enzymes such as the P450 monoxygenases (P450s) and the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). We examined the links between mechanisms for detoxification and excretion in adult Drosophila melanogaster using functional assays and measurements of changes in gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in response to dietary exposure to compounds known to alter activity or gene expression of P450s and GSTs. Dietary exposure to phenol, which alters gene expression for multiple GSTs after seven to 10 generations, was also associated with an increase (more than twofold) in secretion of the organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by isolated tubules. Dietary exposure to the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was associated with reduced expression of two P450 genes (Cyp4e2, Cyp4p1) and two GST genes (GstD1, GstD5) in the tubules, as well as increased expression of Cyp12d1 and GstE1. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of fluid secreted by isolated tubules indicated that dietary exposure to PBO resulted in increased levels of an MTX metabolite. In addition, exposure to PBO altered the expression of transporter genes in the tubules, including a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein, and was associated with a 73% increase in MTX secretion by isolated tubules.

More than half a century ago, Gordon, Huxley and Julian provided strong support for the 'sliding filament' theory that allowed prediction of the active isometric force as a function of sarcomere length (SL). Although the theory was established using single muscle fibers, the sarcomere force-length (FL) relationship has been extrapolated to whole muscles in an attempt to unravel in-vivo muscle function. However, these extrapolations were frequently associated with non-trivial assumptions, such as muscle length changes corresponding linearly to SL changes. However, the sarcomere force-length relationship in whole muscles may not behave as theoretically predicted due to the structural complexity of muscles, the force transmission, pressures and shear forces developed inside muscles, and the great SL non-uniformity recently observed in whole muscles. Here, we determined the in-situ sarcomere FL relationship in a whole muscle preparation by simultaneously measuring muscle force and individual SLs in an intact muscle-tendon unit (MTU) using state-of-the-art multi-photon excitation microscopy. We found that despite great SL non-uniformity, the mean value of SLs measured from a minute volume of the mid-belly, equivalent to about 5 x 10-6 % of the total muscle volume, agrees well with the theoretically predicted FL relationship, but only if the precise contractile filament lengths are known, and if passive forces from parallel elastic components and activation-associated sarcomere shortening are considered properly. As SLs are not uniformly distributed across the whole muscle and changes in SLs with muscle length are location-dependent, our results may not be valid for the proximal or distal parts of the muscle. The approach described here, and our findings, may encourage future studies to determine the role of SL non-uniformity in influencing sarcomere FL properties in different muscles and for different locations within single muscles.",False,"The periodic striation pattern in skeletal muscle reflects the length of the basic contractile unit: the sarcomere. More than half a century ago, Gordon, Huxley and Julian provided strong support for the 'sliding filament' theory that allowed prediction of the active isometric force as a function of sarcomere length (SL). Although the theory was established using single muscle fibers, the sarcomere force-length (FL) relationship has been extrapolated to whole muscles in an attempt to unravel in-vivo muscle function.

For this purpose, experiments were performed using (15)N-enriched DFAAs, and %(15)N enrichment was measured both in animal tissue and zooxanthellae at different DFAA concentrations, incubation time and light levels. As previously observed for urea, which is another source of organic nitrogen, DFAA uptake exhibited a biphasic mode consisting of an active carrier-mediated transport for concentrations below 3 micromol l(-1) and a linear uptake for higher concentrations. The value of the carrier affinity (K(m)=1.23 micromol l(-1) DFAA) indicated good adaptation of the corals to the low levels of DFAA concentrations measured in most oligotrophic waters. DFAA uptake was also correlated with light.

192,Sulfide consumption by mussel gill mitochondria is not strictly tied to oxygen reduction: measurements using a novel polarographic sulfide sensor.,"Some organisms that survive in environments rich in hydrogen sulfide possess specific metabolic pathways for sulfide oxidation and subsequent use of reducing equivalents in oxidative phosphorylation, a process called chemolithoheterotrophy.

Gill mitochondria use sulfide as respiratory substrate for ATP production, and sulfide consumption is sufficiently rapid and so kinetically complex that only continuous real-time detection captures these events.

Mass-specific metabolic enzyme activity confirmed that glycolytic capacity scaled positively in deep white muscle (regression slope, b=0.1 to 0.8) over a body mass range of approximately 20-1500 g, but only creatine phosphokinase showed positive scaling in lateral red muscle (b=0.5). Although oxidative enzymes showed negative allometry in red muscle (b=-0.01 to -0.02), mass-specific myoglobin content scaled positively (b=0.7). Capillary to fibre ratio of red muscle was higher in larger (1.42+/-0.15) than smaller (1.20+/-0.15) fish, suggesting progressive angiogenesis.

195,"Oxygen in egg masses: interactive effects of temperature, age, and egg-mass morphology on oxygen supply to embryos.","Embryos of many marine invertebrates are encased in gelatinous masses for part or all of development. Because gel and intervening embryos retard oxygen flux, such a life-history mode profoundly affects partial pressures of metabolic gases surrounding embryos. However, little is known about relationships between egg-mass structure and the opportunities and constraints imposed on structure by metabolic gas transport. We examined the effects of four factors (temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size) on the metabolism of egg masses using both natural egg masses of a nudibranch and artificial egg masses made from sand dollar embryos and low-melting point agarose. Both temperature and embryo age strongly affected metabolic rates of nudibranch embryos. For embryos of a given age (stage), rates of oxygen consumption roughly doubled between 12 and 21 degrees C; from early cleavage to the veliger stage, consumption rose two- to fourfold, depending on temperature. Oxygen profiles in egg masses showed that advanced embryonic age, and to a lesser extent high temperature, both led to steeper oxygen gradients into egg masses. Egg masses containing advanced embryos at 21 degrees C had very low central oxygen levels. Small-diameter artificial masses (2 mm diameter) had virtually no internal oxygen gradients regardless of embryo density or temperature, while medium (4 mm) and large diameter (10 mm) artificial masses had oxygen profiles that depended strongly and interactively on embryo density and temperature. Together, our data on natural and artificial egg masses suggest that (i) multiple factors have strong effects on metabolic rate; (ii) rates of oxygen transport are relatively invariant with temperature in simple, artificial systems but may vary more strongly with temperature in natural egg masses; and (iii) the four factors--temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size--interact in important ways bearing on egg mass design. A simple mathematical model is developed to provide a quantitative means of estimating primary and interactive effects of the different factors.

198,Water relations of tetrapod integument.,"The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment and regulating the exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have ;plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrier thickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids, and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics, relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment.

199,Associations between tissue fatty acid composition and physiological traits of performance and metabolism in the seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax).,"Seabass were fed for 4 months with diets where the lipid was provided as either canola oil (CO), palm oil (PO) or fish oil (FO), to generate diversity in their tissue fatty acid (FA) composition and investigate how this influenced major traits of exercise performance, cardiac performance and respiratory metabolism. In particular, based upon previous observations, we investigated the hypothesis that enriching the fish tissues with oleic and linoleic acids (OA, 18:1n-9 and LA, 18:2n-6, respectively) from the CO and PO diets would improve maximum exercise and cardiac performance, and increase aerobic metabolic scope. This proved to be the case; exercise respirometry on bass fitted with cardiac flow probes revealed that those fed CO and PO diets had a significantly higher critical swimming speed (U(crit)) than those fed the FO diet. The improved swimming performance in the CO and PO groups was accompanied by a higher maximum cardiac output (Q) and net cardiac scope, and a higher active metabolic rate (AMR) and aerobic scope (AS) than in the FO group. Analysis of tissue FA composition revealed that the fish fed the CO and PO diets had accumulated significantly higher levels of OA and LA in their heart and muscle than the fish from the FO group, which had significantly higher levels of highly unsaturated FA of the n-3 series, such as EPA and DHA (20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, respectively). Principal components analysis revealed significant positive associations between tissue OA and LA content and U(crit), maximum Q, the increase in Q during exercise, AMR and aerobic scope. There was a negative association between these physiological traits and tissue content of EPA.

200,Papiliochrome II pigment reduces the angle dependency of structural wing colouration in nireus group papilionids.,"The wings of four papilionid butterfly species of the nireus group, Papilio bromius, P. epiphorbas, P. nireus and P. oribazus, are marked by blue-green coloured bands surrounded by black margins. The cover scales in the coloured bands contain a violet-absorbing, blue-fluorescing pigment. The fluorescence and absorbance spectra of the nireus group wings are very similar to those of the wings of the Japanese yellow swallowtail, Papilio xuthus, and thus the pigment is presumably papiliochrome II. The scale structures of P. xuthus are arranged irregularly, and both the fluorescence and light reflection are diffuse. In the nireus papilionids, the spatial fluorescence distribution of the scales is also diffuse, but the reflection is specular. The scales have a multilayered structure, consisting of two main laminae. We show that the papiliochrome II pigment in the upper lamina of the scales functions as a violet-blocking long-pass filter in front of the lower lamina, thus limiting the reflectance spectrum to the blue-green wavelength range.

201,Parasitic and immune modulation of flight activity in honey bees tracked with optical counters.,"Host-parasite interactions are often characterized by changes in the host behaviour, which are beneficial to either the parasite or the host, or are a non-adaptive byproduct of parasitism. These interactions are further complicated in animal society because individual fitness is associated with group performance. However, a better understanding of host-parasite interaction in animal society first requires the identification of individual host behavioural modification. Therefore, we challenged honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers with the parasite Nosema ceranae or an immune stimulation and tracked their flight activity over their lifetime with an optic counter. We found that bees responded differently to each stress: both Nosema-infected and immune-challenged bees performed a lower number of daily flights compared with control bees, but the duration of their flights increased and decreased over time, respectively. Overall, parasitized bees spent more time in the field each day than control bees, and the inverse was true for immune-challenged bees. Despite the stress of immune challenge, bees had a survival similar to that of control bees likely because of their restricted activity. We discuss how those different behavioural modifications could be adaptive phenotypes.

We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of D. ananassae in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000-2010).

206,Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation in insect eggs.,"Most terrestrial insect embryos support metabolism with oxygen from the environment by diffusion across the eggshell. Because metabolism is more temperature sensitive than diffusion, embryos should be relatively oxygen-limited at high temperatures. We tested whether survival, development time and metabolism of eggs of a moth, Manduca sexta, were sensitive to experimentally imposed variation in atmospheric oxygen availability (5-50 kPa; normoxia at sea level is 21 kPa) across a range of biologically realistic temperatures. Temperature-oxygen interactions were apparent in most experiments. Hypoxia affected survival more strongly at warmer temperatures. Metabolic rates, measured as rates of CO2 emission, were virtually insensitive to hypo- and hyperoxia at 22 degrees C but were strongly influenced at 37 degrees C. Radial profiles of P(O2) inside eggs, measured using an oxygen microelectrode, demonstrated that 3-day-old eggs had broad central volumes with P(O2) less than 2 kPa, and that higher temperature led to lower P(O2). These data indicate that at realistically high temperatures (32-37 degrees C) eggs of M. sexta were oxygen limited, even in normoxia.

This result has important implications for insect population ecology and the evolution of eggshell structures, and it suggests a novel hypothesis about insect gigantism during Paleozoic hyperoxia.",True,"Most terrestrial insect embryos support metabolism with oxygen from the environment by diffusion across the eggshell. Because metabolism is more temperature sensitive than diffusion, embryos should be relatively oxygen-limited at high temperatures. We tested whether survival, development time and metabolism of eggs of a moth, Manduca sexta, were sensitive to experimentally imposed variation in atmospheric oxygen availability (5–50 kPa; normoxia at sea level is 21 kPa) across a range of biologically realistic temperatures. Temperature–oxygen interactions were apparent in most experiments. Hypoxia affected survival more strongly at warmer temperatures. Metabolic rates, measured as rates of CO2 emission, were virtually insensitive to hypo- and hyperoxia at 22°C but were strongly influenced at 37°C.

To maximise the benefit for the colony, wasps can optimise either the intake rate or energetic efficiency of a foraging trip. We investigated the foraging behaviour of vespine wasps under variable environmental and reward conditions. We trained them to forage for 0.5 mol l–1 sucrose solution from an artificial flower in a flow-through respiratory measurement chamber, and simultaneously measured their body temperature using infrared thermography to investigate interactions between thermoregulation and energetics. Measurement of carbon dioxide release (for energetic calculations) and load mass enabled the direct determination of foraging efficiency. An unlimited reward increased the wasps' energetic effort to increase the suction speed through high body temperatures. With reduced reward (limited flow), when an increased body temperature could not increase suction speed, the wasps decreased their body temperature to reduce the metabolic effort. Solar heat gain was used differently, either to increase body temperature without additional metabolic effort or to save energy. The foraging efficiency was mainly determined by the flow rate, ambient temperature and solar heat gain. In shade, an unlimited sucrose flow and a high ambient temperature yielded the highest energetic benefit. A limited flow reduced foraging efficiency in the shade, but only partly in sunshine. Solar radiation boosted the efficiency at all reward rates. Wasps responded flexibly to varying reward conditions by maximising intake rate at unlimited flow and switching to the optimisation of foraging efficiency when the intake rate could not be enhanced due to a limited flow rate.

208,GABA metabolism is crucial for long-term survival of anoxia in annual killifish embryos.,"In most vertebrates, a lack of oxygen quickly leads to irreparable damages to vital organs, such as the brain and heart. However, there are some vertebrates that have evolved mechanisms to survive periods of no oxygen (anoxia). The annual killifish (Austrofundulus limnaeus) survives in ephemeral ponds in the coastal deserts of Venezuela and their embryos have the remarkable ability to tolerate anoxia for months. When exposed to anoxia, embryos of A. limnaeus respond by producing significant amounts of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This study aims to understand the role of GABA in supporting the metabolic response to anoxia. To explore this, we investigated four developmentally distinct stages of A. limnaeus embryos that vary in their anoxia tolerance. We measured GABA and lactate concentrations across development in response to anoxia and aerobic recovery. We then inhibited enzymes responsible for the production and degradation of GABA and observed GABA and lactate concentrations, as well as embryo mortality. Here, we show for the first time that GABA metabolism affects anoxia tolerance in A. limnaeus embryos. Inhibition of enzymes responsible for GABA production (glutamate decarboxylase) and degradation (GABA-transaminase and succinic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase) led to decreased mortality, supporting a role for GABA as an intermediate product and not a metabolic end product.

209,Bioenergetics and inter-individual variation in physiological capacities in a relict mammal - the Monito del Monte (Dromiciops gliroides).,"In evolutionary physiology, studies of inter-individual variation (i.e. repeatability) in functional capacities are valuable as they indicate - within populations - what attributes could respond to natural selection.

Our results suggest that D. gliroides exhibits poor control of body temperature (T(b)), with a thermal amplitude of ca. 10 degrees C in normothermia. As a consequence, repeatability of T(b) and metabolic rate (either as V(CO(2)) or V(O(2))) were relatively low (tau(T)(b)=0.25+/-0.04, tau(VCO2)=0.14+/-0.03, tau(V)(O2)=0.24+/-0.02, jackknife estimations of standard errors). Thermal conductance exhibited near-zero or negative repeatability and was lower than expected for marsupials.

210,Problems of allometric scaling analysis: examples from mammalian reproductive biology.,"Biological scaling analyses employing the widely used bivariate allometric model are beset by at least four interacting problems: (1) choice of an appropriate best-fit line with due attention to the influence of outliers; (2) objective recognition of divergent subsets in the data (allometric grades); (3) potential restrictions on statistical independence resulting from phylogenetic inertia; and (4) the need for extreme caution in inferring causation from correlation. A new non-parametric line-fitting technique has been developed that eliminates requirements for normality of distribution, greatly reduces the influence of outliers and permits objective recognition of grade shifts in substantial datasets. This technique is applied in scaling analyses of mammalian gestation periods and of neonatal body mass in primates.

Additionally, oviposition sites may be difficult to reach, and penetrating a hard substrate can raise energy costs. In the seed-drilling parasitic wasp Eupelmus vuilleti, females actively fight with conspecific competitors over access to hosts. They are often observed laying eggs on already parasitized hosts (superparasitism) living inside cowpea seeds despite the resulting larval competition. Using flow-through respirometry, we quantified the metabolic costs of fighting and of drilling through the seed to access the host, to understand the wasp’s fighting strategies and the occurrence of superparasitism. Agonistic interactions such as kicks or pushes generated very small instantaneous costs, but the females that won their contests had higher pre-contest metabolic rates, suggesting a potential long-term cost associated with dominance. We also found that drilling holes through the seed accounted for approximately 15% of a wasp's estimated daily energy budget, and that females can reduce these drilling costs by reusing existing holes. Because exploiting new seeds incurs both drilling costs and the risk of fights, it appears cost effective in some situations for females to avoid confrontations and lay eggs in existing holes, on already parasitized hosts.

Red deer antlers were removed from the head at various times, from a few days after velvet shedding till late in the season, and weighed weekly until after casting time. Antlers cut just after losing their velvet lost weight rapidly in the first few weeks, then settled down and changed weight very little, the latter changes correlating with air relative humidity. Antlers cut later showed little weight change at any time. The water content of cortical and trabecular parts of the contralateral antler was assessed after cutting. Most of the weight loss was from the cancellous, not the cortical, part of the antler. Wet and dry specimens from the antlers, and wet specimens from deer femora, were tested mechanically. Compared with wet bone, wet antler had a much lower modulus of elasticity and bending strength, but a higher work to fracture. Compared with wet bone, dry antler showed a somewhat lower Young's modulus, but a considerably higher bending strength and a much higher work to fracture. The impact energy absorption of dry antler was much greater than that of wet bone. In red deer, the antler is effectively dry during its use in fights, at least in southern Spain. In addition, dry antler, compared with ordinary bone, shows mechanical properties that suit it admirably for its fighting function.",10.1242/jeb.032292,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19946076/,The mechanical properties of red deer antler bone when used in fighting,"SUMMARY We assessed the hydration state of antlers and its effect on antler mechanical properties compared with wet femur.

215,Context-dependent olfactory enhancement of optomotor flight control in Drosophila.,"Sensing and following the chemical plume of food odors is a fundamental challenge faced by many organisms. For flying insects, the task is complicated by wind that distorts the plume and buffets the fly. To maintain an upwind heading, and thus stabilize their orientation in a plume, insects such as flies and moths make use of strong context-specific visual equilibrium reflexes. For example, flying straight requires the regulation of image rotation across the eye, whereas minimizing side-slip and avoiding a collision require regulation of image expansion. In flies, visual rotation stabilizes plume tracking, but rotation and expansion optomotor responses are controlled by separate visual pathways. Are olfactory signals integrated with optomotor responses in a manner dependent upon visual context? We addressed this question by investigating the effect of an attractive food odor on active optomotor flight control. Odorant caused flies both to increase aerodynamic power output and to steer straighter. However, when challenged with wide-field optic flow, odor resulted in enhanced amplitude rotation responses but reduced amplitude expansion responses. For both visual conditions, flies tracked motion signals more closely in odor, an indication of increased saliency. These results suggest a simple search algorithm by which olfactory signals improve the salience of visual stimuli and modify optomotor control in a context-dependent manner, thereby enabling an animal to fly straight up a plume and approach odiferous objects.",10.1242/jeb.018879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18626082/,Context-dependent olfactory enhancement of optomotor flight control in Drosophila,"SUMMARY Sensing and following the chemical plume of food odors is a fundamental challenge faced by many organisms.

216,"Area postrema, a brain circumventricular organ, is the site of antidipsogenic action of circulating atrial natriuretic peptide in eels.","Accumulating evidence indicates that circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) potently reduces excess drinking to ameliorate hypernatremia in seawater (SW) eels. However, the cerebral mechanism underlying the antidipsogenic effect is largely unknown. To localize the ANP target site in the brain, we examined the distribution of ANP receptors (NPR-A) in eel brain immunohistochemically using an antiserum specific for eel NPR-A. The immunoreactive NPR-A was localized in the capillaries of various brain regions. In addition, immunoreactive neurons were observed mostly in the medulla oblongata, including the reticular formation, glossopharyngeal-vagal motor complex, commissural nucleus of Cajal, and area postrema (AP). Trypan Blue, which binds serum albumin and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, was injected peripherally and stained the neurons in the AP but not other NPR-A immunopositive neurons. These histological data indicate that circulating ANP acts on the AP, which was further confirmed by physiological experiments. To this end, the AP in SW eels was topically destroyed by electric cauterization or were by chemical lesion of its neurons by kainic acid, and ANP (100 pmol kg(-1)) was then injected into the circulation. Both heat-coagulative and chemical lesions to the AP greatly reduced an antidipsogenic effect of ANP, but the ANP effect was retained in sham-operated eels and in those with lesions outside the AP.

218,Estimation of the force-velocity properties of individual muscles from measurement of the combined plantarflexor properties.,"The force-velocity (F-V) properties of isolated muscles or muscle fibers have been well studied in humans and other animals. However, determining properties of individual muscles in vivo remains a challenge because muscles usually function within a synergistic group. Modeling has been used to estimate the properties of an individual muscle from the experimental measurement of the muscle group properties. While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F-V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors. The first model (Mdl1) assumed that the percent contributions of individual muscles to group force and power were based upon the muscles' cross-sectional areas and were constant across the different isotonic loads applied to the muscle group. The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F-V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but due to differences in muscle architecture, the muscles' contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions to independent estimates of the muscles' contributions based upon sonomicrometry (SONO) measurements of muscle lengths. We found that predictions from Mdl2 were not significantly different from SONO based estimates while those from Mdl1 were significantly different. The results of this study show that incorporating appropriate fiber properties and muscle architecture is necessary to parse the individual muscles' contributions to the group F-V properties.",10.1242/jeb.219980,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34005608/,Estimation of the force-velocity properties of individual muscles from measurement of the combined plantarflexor properties.,"The force-velocity (F-V) properties of isolated muscles or muscle fibers have been well studied in humans and other animals.

219,The effects of CO2 and external buffering on ammonia excretion and Rhesus glycoprotein mRNA expression in rainbow trout.,"Rhesus (Rh) proteins were recently characterized as ammonia gas (NH(3)) channels. Studies indicate, however, that Rh proteins also facilitate CO2 transport in a green alga and in human erythrocytes. Previously, we reported that Rh mRNA expression in various rainbow trout tissues responded to high environmental ammonia. To determine whether or not Rh proteins may also be involved in CO2 transport in rainbow trout, we examined the effects of a 12 h exposure to external hypercapnia (1% CO2 in air) on Rh mRNA expression in the gill, skin and erythrocytes. External hypercapnic conditions lowered the water pH and facilitated ammonia excretion; therefore, we also studied the effects of hypercapnia and normocapnia in the presence of 10 mmol l(-1) Hepes-buffered water. Hepes treatment prevented water acidification, but resulted in elevated plasma ammonia levels and reduced ammonia excretion rates. Hypercapnia exposure without buffering did not elicit changes in Rh mRNA expression in the gill or skin. However, Rhcg2 mRNA expression was downregulated in the gills and upregulated in the skin of both normocapnia- and hypercapnia-exposed fish in Hepes-buffered water. mRNA expression of a newly cloned Rhbg2 cDNA was downregulated in the skin of fish exposed to buffered water, and Rhag mRNA expression in erythrocytes was decreased with exposure to normocapnia in buffered water but not with hypercapnia exposure in either buffered or unbuffered water. With the aid of Hepes buffering, we were able to observe the effects of both CO2 and ammonia on Rh mRNA expression. Overall, we conclude that high CO2 did not directly elicit changes in Rh mRNA transcription levels in the gill and skin, and that the changes observed probably reflect responses to high plasma ammonia, mirroring those in trout exposed to high environmental ammonia. Therefore a dual function for gill and skin Rh proteins in CO2 and ammonia transport is not evident from these results. Rhag expression, however, responded differentially to high CO2 and high ammonia, suggesting a possible dual role in the erythrocytes.",10.1242/jeb.020396,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18840656/,The effects of CO2 and external buffering on ammonia excretion and Rhesus glycoprotein mRNA expression in rainbow trout,"SUMMARY Rhesus (Rh) proteins were recently characterized as ammonia gas (NH3) channels.

220,Aerodynamics of gliding flight in common swifts.,"Gliding flight performance and wake topology of a common swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(-1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s(-1) and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s(-1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s(-1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices.

221,Distinct physiological strategies are used to cope with constant hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus).,"Many fish encounter hypoxia on a daily cycle, but the physiological effects of intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to constant (sustained) hypoxia or to intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia (12 h normoxia:12 h hypoxia) had distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance or on several determinants of O2 transport and O2 utilization in estuarine killifish. Adult killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia for 7 or 28 days in brackish water (4 ppt). Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to comparable reductions in critical O2 tension and resting O2 consumption rate, but only constant hypoxia reduced the O2 tension at loss of equilibrium. Constant (but not intermittent) hypoxia decreased filament length and the proportion of seawater-type mitochondrion-rich cells in the gills (which may reduce ion loss and the associated costs of active ion uptake), increased blood haemoglobin content, and reduced the abundance of oxidative fibres in the swimming muscle.

Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to comparable reductions in critical O2 tension and resting O2 consumption rate, but only constant hypoxia reduced the O2 tension at loss of equilibrium.

223,Beauty in the eye of the beholder: the two blue opsins of lycaenid butterflies and the opsin gene-driven evolution of sexually dimorphic eyes.,"Although previous investigations have shown that wing coloration is an important component of social signaling in butterflies, the contribution of opsin evolution to sexual wing color dichromatism and interspecific divergence remains largely unexplored. Here we report that the butterfly Lycaena rubidus has evolved sexually dimorphic eyes due to changes in the regulation of opsin expression patterns to match the contrasting life histories of males and females. The L. rubidus eye contains four visual pigments with peak sensitivities in the ultraviolet (UV; lambdamax=360 nm), blue (B; lambdamax=437 nm and 500 nm, respectively) and long (LW; lambdamax=568 nm) wavelength range. By combining in situ hybridization of cloned opsin-encoding cDNAs with epi-microspectrophotometry, we found that all four opsin mRNAs and visual pigments are expressed in the eyes in a sex-specific manner. The male dorsal eye, which contains only UV and B (lambdamax=437 nm) visual pigments, indeed expresses two short wavelength opsin mRNAs, UVRh and BRh1. The female dorsal eye, which also has the UV and B (lambdamax=437 nm) visual pigments, also contains the LW visual pigment, and likewise expresses UVRh, BRh1 and LWRh mRNAs.

Surprisingly, we found that the 500 nm visual pigment is encoded by a duplicate blue opsin gene, BRh2.

224,A new model predicting locomotor cost from limb length via force production.,"Notably absent from the existing literature is an explicit biomechanical model linking limb design to the energy cost of locomotion, COL. Here, I present a simple model that predicts the rate of force production necessary to support the body and swing the limb during walking and running as a function of speed, limb length, limb proportion, excursion angle and stride frequency. The estimated rate of force production is then used to predict COL via this model following previous studies that have linked COL to force production. To test this model, oxygen consumption and kinematics were measured in nine human subjects while walking and running on a treadmill at range of speeds. Following the model, limb length, speed, excursion angle and stride frequency were used to predict the rate of force production both to support the body's center of mass and to swing the limb.

226,Switching destinations: memory change in wood ants.,"We have studied the changing use of spatial memories in wood ants by charting how the ants' paths transform when ants are first trained to feed at one site and must then switch to another site.

For a given claw size, regenerated claws have less muscle mass than original claws, and for a given muscle mass, regenerated claws were significantly weaker than original claws. The mechanical advantage was also lower in regenerated claws compared with original claws. However, the activity of three catabolic enzymes did not differ between claw types. We conclude that the structural and physiological predictors of force production influence the frequencies of reliable and unreliable signals of strength in U. vomeris. This study furthers our understanding of the proliferation of unreliable signals in natural populations. Summary: The frequencies of reliable and unreliable signals of strength in Uca vomeris are influenced by the structural and physiological mechanisms behind force production in the major claw."

230,The trade-off between growth rate and locomotor performance varies with perceived time until breeding.,"Environmental circumstances can cause changes in early growth patterns that subsequently affect the adult phenotype. Here we investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent locomotor performance, and how such effects were influenced by the perceived time until the key life-history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus, we show that a brief period of manipulated temperature in early life (independent of food supply) caused effects on skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, their growth trajectory had impacts on both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with skeletal growth rate during the compensation period. We also show for the first time that 'negative compensation' (i.e. a decelerating growth trajectory) led to an improved swimming performance compared with steadily growing controls. Replicate experiments and photoperiod manipulations, moreover, revealed that the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming performance were greater when the perceived time until the breeding season was shorter. These results show that the costs of accelerated or decelerated growth can last well beyond the time over which growth rates differ, and are affected by the time available until an approaching life history event such as reproduction, possibly because of the time available to repair the damage.",10.1242/jeb.043083,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20833921/,The trade-off between growth rate and locomotor performance varies with perceived time until breeding,"SUMMARY Environmental circumstances can cause changes in early growth patterns that subsequently affect the adult phenotype.

231,The hydrodynamics of eel swimming: I. Wake structure.,"Eels undulate a larger portion of their bodies while swimming than many other fishes, but the hydrodynamic consequences of this swimming mode are poorly understood. In this study, we examine in detail the hydrodynamics of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) swimming steadily at 1.4 L s(-1) and compare them with previous results from other fishes. We performed high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) to quantify the wake structure, measure the swimming efficiency, and force and power output. The wake consists of jets of fluid that point almost directly laterally, separated by an unstable shear layer that rolls up into two or more vortices over time. Previously, the wake of swimming eels was hypothesized to consist of unlinked vortex rings, resulting from a phase offset between vorticity distributed along the body and vorticity shed at the tail. Our high-resolution flow data suggest that the body anterior to the tail tip produces relatively low vorticity, and instead the wake structure results from the instability of the shear layers separating the lateral jets, reflecting pulses of high vorticity shed at the tail tip. We compare the wake structure to large-amplitude elongated body theory and to a previous computational fluid dynamic model and note several discrepancies between the models and the measured values. The wake of steadily swimming eels differs substantially in structure from the wake of previously studied carangiform fishes in that it lacks any significant downstream flow, previously interpreted as signifying thrust. We infer that the lack of downstream flow results from a spatial and temporal balance of momentum removal (drag) and thrust generated along the body, due to the relatively uniform shape of eels. Carangiform swimmers typically have a narrow caudal peduncle, which probably allows them to separate thrust from drag both spatially and temporally. Eels seem to lack this separation, which may explain why they produce a wake with little downstream momentum while carangiform swimmers produce a wake with a clear thrust signature.",10.1242/jeb.00968,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15107438/,The hydrodynamics of eel swimming,"SUMMARY Eels undulate a larger portion of their bodies while swimming than many other fishes, but the hydrodynamic consequences of this swimming mode are poorly understood.

In the first experiment, we examined the effects of seasonal temperature changes on the freshwater bivalve Anodonta anatina, taking measurements each month for a year at the corresponding temperature for that time of year. There was no evidence for compensation of burrowing valve closure duration or frequency, or locomotory speed.

Within the experimental limits of this study, the evidence suggests that thermal compensation of biological rates is not a strategy employed by A. anatina. We argue that this is due to either a lack of evolutionary pressure to acclimatize, or evolutionary pressure to not acclimatize.

234,Mono- versus biarticular muscle function in relation to speed and gait changes: in vivo analysis of the goat triceps brachii.,"The roles of muscles that span a single joint (monoarticular) versus those that span two (biarticular) or more joints have been suggested to differ. Monoarticular muscles are argued to perform work at a joint, whereas biarticular muscles are argued to transfer energy while resisting moments across adjacent joints. To test these predictions, in vivo patterns of muscle activation, strain, and strain rate were compared using electromyography and sonomicrometry in two major elbow extensors, the long and lateral heads of the triceps brachii of goats (Capra hircus), across a range of speed (1-5 m s(-1)) and gait. Muscle recordings were synchronized to limb kinematics using high-speed digital video imaging (250 Hz). Measurements obtained from four goats (25-45 kg) showed that the monoarticular lateral head exhibited a stretch-shortening pattern (6.8+/-0.6% stretch and -10.6+/-2.7% shortening; mean+/-s.e.m. for all speeds and gaits) after being activated, which parallels the flexion-extension pattern of the elbow. By contrast, the biarticular long head shortened through most of stance (-16.4+/-3.4%), despite elbow flexion in the first half and shoulder extension in the last half of stance. The magnitude of elbow flexion and shoulder extension increased with increasing speed (ANCOVA, P<0.05 and P<0.001), as did the magnitude and rate of active stretch of fascicles in the lateral head (P<0.001 for both). In all individuals, shortening fascicle strain rates increased with speed in the long head (P<0.001), and, in three of the four individuals, strain magnitude increased.

236,The relationship between myonuclear number and protein synthesis in individual rat skeletal muscle fibres.,"Skeletal muscle has numerous nuclei within a cell. The nucleus is considered as the central organelle for muscle protein synthesis (MPS).

237,Evidence for an audience effect in mice: male social partners alter the male vocal response to female cues.,"Mice (Mus musculus) form large and dynamic social groups and emit ultrasonic vocalizations in a variety of social contexts. Surprisingly, these vocalizations have been studied almost exclusively in the context of cues from only one social partner, despite the observation that in many social species the presence of additional listeners changes the structure of communication signals. Here, we show that male vocal behavior elicited by female odor is affected by the presence of a male audience - with changes in vocalization count, acoustic structure and syllable complexity. We further show that single sensory cues are not sufficient to elicit this audience effect, indicating that multiple cues may be necessary for an audience to be apparent.

239,Bluegill sunfish use high power outputs from axial muscles to generate powerful suction-feeding strikes.,"Suction-feeding fish rapidly expand the mouth cavity to generate high-velocity fluid flows that accelerate food into the mouth. Such fast and forceful suction expansion poses a challenge, as muscle power is limited by muscle mass and the muscles in fish heads are relatively small.

However, bluegill sunfish - with powerful strikes but different morphology and feeding behavior - may use a different balance of cranial and axial musculature to power feeding and different power outputs from these muscles. We estimated the power required for suction expansion in sunfish from measurements of intraoral pressure and rate of volume change, and measured muscle length and velocity. Unlike largemouth bass, the sternohyoideus did shorten to generate power, but it and other head muscles were too small to contribute more than 5-10% of peak expansion power in sunfish.

242,Hearing in hooktip moths (Drepanidae: Lepidoptera).,"This study presents anatomical and physiological evidence for a sense of hearing in hooktip moths (Drepanoidea). Two example species, Drepana arcuata and Watsonalla uncinula, were examined. The abdominal ears of drepanids are structurally unique compared to those of other Lepidoptera and other insects, by having an internal tympanal membrane, and auditory sensilla embedded within the membrane. The tympanum is formed by two thin tracheal walls that stretch across a teardrop-shaped opening between dorsal and ventral air chambers in the first abdominal segment. There are four sensory organs (scolopidia) embedded separately between the tympanal membrane layers: two larger lateral scolopidia within the tympanal area, and two smaller scolopidia at the medial margin of the tympanal frame. Sound is thought to reach the tympanal membrane through two external membranes that connect indirectly to the dorsal chamber. The ear is tuned to ultrasonic frequencies between 30 and 65 kHz, with a best threshold of around 52 dB SPL at 40 kHz, and no apparent difference between genders. Thus, drepanid hearing resembles that of other moths, indicating that the main function is bat detection. Two sensory cells are excited by sound stimuli. Those two cells differ in threshold by approximately 19 dB. The morphology of the ear suggests that the two larger scolopidia function as auditory sensilla; the two smaller scolopidia, located near the tympanal frame, were not excited by sound.

244,Spatial orientation based on multiple visual cues in non-migratory monarch butterflies.,"Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are prominent for their annual long-distance migration from North America to their overwintering area in Central Mexico.

This indicates that the migratory butterflies also attend to the panorama to guide their travels. While the compass has been studied in detail in migrating butterflies, little is known about the orientation abilities of non-migrating butterflies. Here we studied if non-migrating butterflies - that stay in a more restricted area to feed and breed - also use a similar compass system to guide their flights.

245,Distinct neuron phenotypes may serve object feature sensing in the electrosensory lobe of Gymnotus omarorum.,"Early sensory relay circuits in the vertebrate medulla often adopt a cerebellum-like organization specialized for comparing primary afferent inputs with central expectations. These circuits usually have a dual output, carried by center ON and center OFF neurons responding in opposite ways to the same stimulus at the center of their receptive fields. Here, we show in the electrosensory lateral line lobe of Gymnotiform weakly electric fish that basilar pyramidal neurons, representing 'ON' cells, and non-basilar pyramidal neurons, representing 'OFF' cells, have different intrinsic electrophysiological properties. We used classical anatomical techniques and electrophysiological in vitro recordings to compare these neurons. Basilar neurons are silent at rest, have a high threshold to intracellular stimulation, delayed responses to steady-state depolarization and low pass responsiveness to membrane voltage variations. They respond to low-intensity depolarizing stimuli with large, isolated spikes. As stimulus intensity increases, the spikes are followed by a depolarizing after-potential from which phase-locked spikes often arise. Non-basilar neurons show a pacemaker-like spiking activity, smoothly modulated in frequency by slow variations of stimulus intensity.

However, even in a sophisticated genetic model system like Drosophila melanogaster, few genes have been identified as functioning in cold tolerance. The accumulation of the Frost (Fst) gene transcript increases after cold exposure, making it a good candidate for a gene that has a role in cold tolerance. Despite extensive RNAi knockdown analysis, no role in cold tolerance has been assigned to Fst. CRISPR is an effective technique for completely knocking down genes, and is less likely to produce off-target effects than GAL4-UAS RNAi systems. We have used CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination to generate Fst-null alleles, and these Fst alleles uncovered a requirement for FST protein in maintaining female fecundity following cold exposure. However, FST does not have a direct role in survival following cold exposure. FST mRNA accumulates in the Malpighian tubules, and the FST protein is a highly disordered protein with a putative signal peptide for export from the cell. Future work is needed to determine whether FST is exported from the Malpighian tubules and directly interacts with female reproductive tissues post-cold exposure, or whether it is required for other repair/recovery functions that indirectly alter energy allocation to reproduction. Summary: The Drosophila gene Frost is expressed in response to cold exposure. Genome editing shows that its function is to protect post-cold reproduction rather than to improve tolerance during cold exposure.",True,"The ability to survive and reproduce after cold exposure is important in all kingdoms of life.

247,Significant dissociation of expression patterns of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Dec1 and Dec2 in rat kidney.,"Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock that show robust circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and various peripheral tissues. Although the expression of Dec1 and Dec2 is altered by multiple stimuli in different organs, their transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have not been fully elucidated for the kidney. In the present study, we describe for the first time significant dissociation of expression patterns with arrhythmic expression of Dec1 and rhythmic expression of Dec2 in rat kidney under a normal light-dark (LD) cycle. Daytime restricted feeding (RF) significantly altered the expression patterns of these two clock genes, and even induced circadian expression of Dec1 with an amplitude of 2.2 on day 3 and 4.2 on day 7. However, when a reversed feeding schedule was coupled with a reversed LD cycle, the expression of Dec1 but not Dec2 reverted to being arrhythmic. Moreover, exogenous injection of the glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone (Dex) at certain times of the day resulted in rhythmic expression of Dec1, which was similar to that seen following RF for 7 days. In contrast, endogenous disruption of glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy abolished RF-induced rhythmic expression of Dec1 in the kidney.

251,"Jumping mechanisms of treehopper insects (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae).","The kinematics and jumping performance of treehoppers (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Membracidae) were analysed from high speed images. The eight species analysed had an 11-fold range of body mass (3.8-41 mg) and a 2-fold range of body length (4.1-8.4 mm). Body shape was dominated by a prothoracic helmet that projected dorsally and posteriorly over the body, and in some species forwards to form a protruding horn. Jumping was propelled by rapid depression of the trochantera of the hindlegs. The hindlegs were only 30-60% longer than the front and middle legs, and 47-94% the length of the body in different species. They were slung beneath the body and moved together in the same plane. In preparation for a jump, the hindlegs were initially levated and rotated forwards so that the femora were pressed into indentations of the coxae. The tibiae were flexed about the femora and the tarsi were placed on the ground directly beneath the lateral edges of the abdomen. Movements of the front and middle legs adjusted the angle of the body relative to the ground, but for most treehoppers this angle was small, so that the body was almost parallel to the ground. The rapid depression of the hindlegs accelerated the body to take-off in 1.2 ms in the lighter treehoppers and 3.7 ms in the heavier ones. Take-off velocities of 2.1-2.7 m s(-1) were achieved and were not correlated with body mass.

253,The learning and maintenance of local vectors in desert ant navigation.,"The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis has at least three types of navigational strategy that can guide it between its nest and a familiar food site. The initial strategy after first finding a food site is based on a path integration memory of the position of the food site with respect to the nest. A second strategy is based on visual snapshot memories of features viewed from near or on the way to the food site. A third strategy uses local vector memories of the direction and length of habitual route segments. We show here that while such local vectors encode sufficient information to guide an individual along both the direction and distance of a route segment, its acquisition and long-term maintenance requires support from the other two strategies. We trained ants along an L-shaped route, designed to show that ants can learn local vectors on the way to a food site. The sharp turn appears to present particular difficulties for the ants. When low bushes 20-30 m from the route were removed, local vectors were briefly unaffected, but then deteriorated. The vectors improved again once the missing bushes were replaced by artificial landmarks. The fragility of local vector memories may permit an ant the flexibility to adapt its route to fluctuations in the distribution of its resources.",10.1242/jeb.024521,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19282485/,The learning and maintenance of local vectors in desert ant navigation,"SUMMARY The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis has at least three types of navigational strategy that can guide it between its nest and a familiar food site.

254,The hydrocarbon seep tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi primarily eliminates sulfate and hydrogen ions across its roots to conserve energy and ensure sulfide supply.,"Lamellibrachia luymesi (Polychaeta, Siboglinidae) is a deep-sea vestimentiferan tubeworm that forms large bush-like aggregations at hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. Like all vestimentiferans, L. luymesi obtains its nutrition from sulfide-oxidizing endosymbiotic bacteria, which it houses in an internal organ called the trophosome. This tubeworm has a lifespan of over 170 years and its survival is contingent upon the availability of sulfide during this long period. In sediments underlying L. luymesi aggregations, microbes produce sulfide by coupling sulfate reduction with hydrocarbon oxidation. L. luymesi acquires sulfide from the sediment using a root-like posterior extension of its body that is buried in the sediment. Its symbionts then oxidize the sulfide to produce energy for carbon fixation, and release sulfate and hydrogen ions as byproducts. It is critical for the tubeworm to eliminate these waste ions, and it could do so either across its vascular plume or across its root. In this study, we measured sulfate and proton elimination rates from live L. luymesi and found that they eliminated approximately 85% of the sulfate produced by sulfide oxidation, and approximately 67% of the protons produced by various metabolic processes, across their roots. On the basis of experiments using membrane transport inhibitors, we suggest that L. luymesi has anion exchangers that mediate sulfate elimination coupled with bicarbonate uptake. Roots could be the ideal exchange surface for eliminating sulfate and hydrogen ions for two reasons. First, these ions might be eliminated across the root epithelium using facilitated diffusion, which is energetically economical. Second, sulfate and hydrogen ions are substrates for bacterial sulfate reduction, and supplying these ions into the sediment might help ensure a sustained sulfide supply for L. luymesi over its entire lifespan.",10.1242/jeb.02413,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16985196/,The hydrocarbon seep tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi primarily eliminates sulfate and hydrogen ions across its roots to conserve energy and ensure sulfide supply,"SUMMARY Lamellibrachia luymesi (Polychaeta, Siboglinidae) is a deep-sea vestimentiferan tubeworm that forms large bush-like aggregations at hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico.

255,"Flight and echolocation behaviour of whiskered bats commuting along a hedgerow: range-dependent sonar signal design, Doppler tolerance and evidence for 'acoustic focussing'.","Echolocating bats obtain three-dimensional images of their surroundings in complete darkness by emitting sonar signals and evaluating returning echoes. When flying close to objects, bats risk collision and therefore depend on the accuracy of images--particularly in the perceived distance of obstacles, which is coded by the time delay between call and echo. Yet, during flight, such accuracy is perturbed first because bats call and receive echoes at different positions and second because echoes are modified by Doppler shifts. Certain call designs avoid both sources of ranging error, but only for a limited range of distances [the 'distance of focus' (DOF)]. Here, we show that whiskered bats (Myotis mystacinus) using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localised accurately. Such behaviour is adaptive because it reduces collision risk. The bats also reduced call duration to some extent as they approached obstacles so that most returning echoes arrived after they finished calling. This reduction in call duration during the approach to obstacles was neither the only nor the main factor that influenced DOF. Indeed, both duration and bandwidth of calls influenced DOF independently, with lower bandwidths and longer durations giving greater DOF.

Arterial P(O(2)) profiles (57 dives) revealed that (a) pre-dive P(O(2)) was greater than that at rest, (b) P(O(2)) transiently increased during descent and (c) post-dive P(O(2)) reached that at rest in 1.92+/-1.89 min (N=53). Venous P(O(2)) profiles (130 dives) revealed that (a) pre-dive venous P(O(2)) was greater than that at rest prior to 61% of dives, (b) in 90% of dives venous P(O(2)) transiently increased with a mean maximum P(O(2)) of 53+/-18 mmHg and a mean increase in P(O(2)) of 11+/-12 mmHg, (c) in 78% of dives, this peak venous P(O(2)) occurred within the first 3 min, and (d) post-dive venous P(O(2)) reached that at rest within 2.23+/-2.64 min (N=84). Arterial and venous P(O(2)) values in blood samples collected 1-3 min into dives were greater than or near to the respective values at rest.

Five variables differed inter-specifically (pectoral girdle retraction magnitude and timing, cranial and hyoid elevation and gape-distance timing), yet an incomplete taxon separation across multivariate kinematic space demonstrated an overall similarity in raking behavior. An outgroup analysis using bowfin (Amia calva) and pickerel (Esox americanus) to compare kinematics of raking with chewing and prey-capture provided robust quantitative evidence of raking being a convergently derived behavior.

These models will aid future analyses mapping structural and functional traits to the evolution of behaviors."

Therefore, any deficiency in the visual system could have important consequences for individual performance. We examined the effect of CO2 levels projected to occur by the end of this century on retinal responses in a damselfish, by determining the threshold of its flicker electroretinogram (fERG). The maximal flicker frequency of the retina was reduced by continuous exposure to elevated CO2, potentially impairing the capacity of fish to react to fast events. This effect was rapidly counteracted by treatment with a GABA antagonist (gabazine), indicating that GABAA receptor function is disrupted by elevated CO2.

263,"Spectral sensitivity of the concave mirror eyes of scallops: potential influences of habitat, self-screening and longitudinal chromatic aberration.","Scallop eyes contain two retinas, one proximal and one distal. Molecular evidence suggests that each retina expresses a different visual pigment. To test whether these retinas have different spectral sensitivities, we used microspectrophotometry to measure the absorption spectra of photoreceptors from the eyes of two different scallop species. Photoreceptors from the proximal and distal retinas of the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus had absorption peak wavelengths (λ(max)) of 488 ± 1 nm (mean ± s.e.m.; N=20) and 513 ± 3 nm (N=26), respectively. Photoreceptors from the corresponding retinas of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians had λ(max) values of 506 ± 1 nm (N=21) and 535 ± 3 nm (N=14). Assuming that the proximal and distal receptors had equal absorption coefficients (k(D)=0.0067 microm(-1)), we found that self-screening within the scallop eye caused the proximal and distal receptors in P. magellanicus to have peak absorption at 490 and 520 nm, respectively, and the corresponding receptors in A. irradians to have peak absorption at 504 and 549 nm.

266,Reversibility of developmental heat and cold plasticity is asymmetric and has long-lasting consequences for adult thermal tolerance.,"The ability of insects to cope with stressful temperatures through adaptive plasticity has allowed them to thrive under a wide range of thermal conditions. Developmental plasticity is generally considered to be a non-reversible phenotypic change, e.g. in morphological traits, while adult acclimation responses are often considered to be reversible physiological responses. However, physiologically mediated thermal acclimation might not follow this general prediction. We investigated the magnitude and rate of reversibility of developmental thermal plasticity responses in heat and cold tolerance of adult flies, using a full factorial design with two developmental and two adult temperatures (15 and 25°C). We show that cold tolerance attained during development is readily adjusted to the prevailing conditions during adult acclimation, with a symmetric rate of decrease or increase. In contrast, heat tolerance is only partly reversible during acclimation and is thus constrained by the temperature during development. The effect of adult acclimation on heat tolerance was asymmetrical, with a general loss of heat tolerance with age. Surprisingly, the decline in adult heat tolerance at 25°C was decelerated in flies developed at low temperatures. This result was supported by correlated responses in two senescence-associated traits and in accordance with a lower rate of ageing after low temperature development, suggesting that physiological age is not reset at eclosion.

267,Hydrodynamics of pulsed jetting in juvenile and adult brief squid Lolliguncula brevis: evidence of multiple jet 'modes' and their implications for propulsive efficiency.,"The dynamics of pulsed jetting in squids throughout ontogeny is not well understood, especially with regard to the development of vortex rings, which are common features of mechanically generated jet pulses (also known as starting jets). Studies of mechanically generated starting jets have revealed a limiting principle for vortex ring formation characterized in terms of a ;formation number' (F), which delineates the transition between the formation of isolated vortex rings and vortex rings that have; pinched off' from the generating jet. Near F, there exists an optimum in pulse-averaged thrust with (potentially) low energetic cost, raising the question: do squids produce vortex rings and if so, do they fall near F, where propulsive benefits presumably occur? To better understand vortex ring dynamics and propulsive jet efficiency throughout ontogeny, brief squid Lolliguncula brevis ranging from 3.3 to 9.1 cm dorsal mantle length (DML) and swimming at speeds of 2.43-22.2 cms(-1) (0.54-3.50 DMLs(-1)) were studied using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). A range of jet structures were observed but most structures could be classified as variations of two principal jet modes: (1) jet mode I, where the ejected fluid rolled up into an isolated vortex ring; and (2) jet mode II, where the ejected fluid developed into a leading vortex ring that separated or ;pinched off' from a long trailing jet. The ratio of jet length [based on the vorticity extent (L(omega))] to jet diameter [based on peak vorticity locations (D(omega))] was <3.0 for jet mode I and >3.0 for jet mode II, placing the transition between modes in rough agreement with F determined in mechanical jet studies. Jet mode II produced greater time-averaged thrust and lift forces and was the jet mode most heavily used whereas jet mode I had higher propulsive efficiency, lower slip, shorter jet periods and a higher frequency of fin activity associated with it. No relationship between L(omega)/D(omega) and speed was detected and there was no apparent speed preference for the jet modes within the speed range considered in this study; however, propulsive efficiency did increase with speed partly because of a reduction in slip and jet angle with speed. Trends in higher slip, lower propulsive efficiency and higher relative lift production were observed for squid <5.0 cm DML compared with squid >/=5.0 cm DML. While these trends were observed when jet mode I and II were equally represented among the size classes, there was also greater relative dependence on jet mode I than jet mode II for squid <5.0 cm DML when all of the available jet sequences were examined. Collectively, these results indicate that approximately 5.0 cm DML is an important ontogenetic transition for the hydrodynamics of pulsed jetting in squids. The significance of our findings is that from early juvenile through to adult life stages, L. brevis is capable of producing a diversity of vortex ring-based jet structures, ranging from efficient short pulses to high-force longer duration pulses. Given that some of these structures had L(omega)/D(omega)s near F, and F represented the delineation between the two primary jet modes observed, fluid dynamics probably played an integral role in the evolution of squid locomotive systems.

The ratio of jet length [based on the vorticity extent (Lω)] to jet diameter [based on peak vorticity locations (Dω)] was <3.0 for jet mode I and> 3.0 for jet mode II, placing the transition between modes in rough agreement with F determined in mechanical jet studies. Jet mode II produced greater time-averaged thrust and lift forces and was the jet mode most heavily used whereas jet mode I had higher propulsive efficiency, lower slip, shorter jet periods and a higher frequency of fin activity associated with it. No relationship between Lω/Dω and speed was detected and there was no apparent speed preference for the jet modes within the speed range considered in this study; however, propulsive efficiency did increase with speed partly because of a reduction in slip and jet angle with speed. Trends in higher slip, lower propulsive efficiency and higher relative lift production were observed for squid <5.0 cm DML compared with squid ≥5.0 cm DML. While these trends were observed when jet mode I and II were equally represented among the size classes, there was also greater relative dependence on jet mode I than jet mode II for squid <5.0 cm DML when all of the available jet sequences were examined. Collectively, these results indicate that ∼5.0 cm DML is an important ontogenetic transition for the hydrodynamics of pulsed jetting in squids. The significance of our findings is that from early juvenile through to adult life stages, L. brevis is capable of producing a diversity of vortex ring-based jet structures, ranging from efficient short pulses to high-force longer duration pulses. Given that some of these structures had Lω/Dωs near F, and F represented the delineation between the two primary jet modes observed, fluid dynamics probably played an integral role in the evolution of squid locomotive systems. When this flexibility in jet dynamics is coupled with the highly versatile fins, which are capable of producing multiple hydrodynamic modes as well, it is clear that squid have a locomotive repertoire far more complex than originally thought."
268,First evidence of epithelial transport in tardigrades: a comparative investigation of organic anion transport.,"We investigated transport of the organic anion Chlorophenol Red (CPR) in the tardigrade Halobiotus crispae using a new method for quantifying non-fluorescent dyes. We compared the results acquired from the tardigrade with CPR transport data obtained from Malpighian tubules of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria. CPR accumulated in the midgut lumen of H. crispae, indicating that organic anion transport takes place here. Our results show that CPR transport is inhibited by the mitochondrial un-coupler DNP (1 mmol l(-1); 81% reduction), the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10 mmol l(-1); 21% reduction) and the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin (5 μmol l(-1); 21% reduction), and by the organic anions PAH (10 mmol l(-1); 44% reduction) and probenecid (10 mmol l(-1); 61% reduction, concentration-dependent inhibition). Transport by locust Malpighian tubules exhibits a similar pharmacological profile, albeit with markedly higher concentrations of CPR being reached in S. gregaria.

272,Origins of variation in muscle cytochrome c oxidase activity within and between fish species.,"Mitochondrial content, central to aerobic metabolism, is thought to be controlled by a few transcriptional master regulators, including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), NRF-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α).

When incubated at the body temperature of the animal from which the cells were isolated, the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, significantly increased surfactant secretion in both warm-active and torpid squirrel type II cells. However, the cholinergic agonist, carbamylcholine chloride, only increased secretion in torpid squirrel type II cells when incubated at 4°C. Torpor did not affect basal cAMP production from isolated type II cells. However, the production of cAMP appears to be upregulated in response to isoproterenol in torpid squirrel type II cells. Thus, at the cellular level, both the secretory and regulatory pathways involved in surfactant secretion are thermally insensitive. Upregulating basal secretion and increasing the sensitivity of type II cells to cholinergic stimulation may be adaptative characteristics of torpor that enable type II cells to function effectively at 0-5°C."
275,Slow waves during sleep in crayfish. Origin and spread.,"Previous results show that when unrestrained crayfish sleep, the electrical activity of the brain changes from multiple spikes (frequencies above 300 Hz) on a flat baseline to continuous slow waves at a frequency of 15-20 Hz. To study the temporal organization of such activity, we developed a tethered crayfish preparation that allows us to place electrodes on visually identified regions of the brain. Recording the electrical activity of different brain areas shows that when the animal is active (awake), slow waves are present only in the central complex. However, simultaneously with the animal becoming limp (sleeping), slow waves spread first to deuto- and then to protocerebrum, suggesting that the central complex of the crayfish brain acts as the sleep generator.",10.1242/jeb.038240,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20511530/,Slow waves during sleep in crayfish.

276,Tolerance of aquifer stoneflies to repeated hypoxia exposure and oxygen dynamics in an alluvial aquifer.,"Aquatic insects cope with hypoxia and anoxia using a variety of behavioral and physiological responses. Most stoneflies (Plecoptera) occur in highly oxygenated surface waters, but some species live underground in alluvial aquifers containing heterogeneous oxygen concentrations. Aquifer stoneflies appear to be supported by methane-derived food resources, which they may exploit using anoxia-resistant behaviors. We documented dissolved oxygen dynamics and collected stoneflies over five years in floodplain wells of the Flathead River, Montana. Hypoxia regularly occurred in two wells, and nymphs of Paraperla frontalis were collected during hypoxic periods. We measured mass-specific metabolic rates (MSMR) at different oxygen concentrations (12, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.5 mg/L, and during recovery) for 111 stonefly nymphs to determine whether aquifer and benthic taxa differed in hypoxia tolerance. Metabolic rates of aquifer taxa were similar across oxygen concentrations spanning 12 to 2 mg/L (P>0.437), but rates of benthic taxa dropped significantly with declining oxygen (P<0.0001; 2.9× lower at 2 vs. 12 mg/L). Aquifer taxa tolerated short-term repeated exposure to extreme hypoxia surprisingly well (100% survival), but repeated longer-term (> 12 hours) exposures resulted in lower survival (38-91%) and lower metabolic rates during recovery. Our work suggests that aquifer stoneflies have evolved a remarkable set of behavioral and physiological adaptations that allow them to exploit the unique food resources available in hypoxic zones. These adaptations help explain how large-bodied consumers might thrive in the underground aquifers of diverse and productive river floodplains.",10.1242/jeb.225623,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34005614/,Tolerance of aquifer stoneflies to repeated hypoxia exposure and oxygen dynamics in an alluvial aquifer.,"Aquatic insects cope with hypoxia and anoxia using a variety of behavioral and physiological responses.

277,Aversive operant conditioning alters the phototactic orientation of the marbled crayfish.,"Aversive learning was applied to affect the phototactic behaviour of the marbled crayfish. Animals initially showed negative phototaxis to white light and positive taxis to blue light. Using an aversive learning paradigm, we investigated the plasticity of innate behaviour following operant conditioning. The initial rate of choosing a blue-lit exit was analysed by a dual choice experiment between blue-lit and white-lit exits in pre-test conditions. During training, electrical shocks were applied to the animals when they oriented to the blue-lit exit. Memory tests were given to analyse the orientation rate to the blue-lit exit in trials 1 and 24 h after training and these rates were compared with the pre-test. In general, animals avoided the blue-lit exit in the memory tests. When training was carried out three times, the long-term memory was retained for at least 48 h, although a single bout of training was also enough to form a long-term memory. Cooling animals at 4°C or injection of cycloheximide immediately after training altered the formation of long-term memory, but had no effect on short-term memory formation. Administration of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536, the PKA inhibitor H89 or the CREB inhibitor KG-501 immediately after training also blocked the formation of long-term memory, but had no effect on short-term memory formation.

278,The sub-lethal effects of repeated freezing in the woolly bear caterpillar Pyrrharctia isabella.,"Repeated freeze-thaw cycles are common and are increasing in frequency with climate change in many temperate locations, yet understanding of their impact on freeze-tolerant insects is extremely limited.

279,Burrow surveillance in fiddler crabs. I. Description of behaviour.,"When defending resources, animals need to reliably detect and identify potential competitors. Animals that live at high population densities would be expected to be efficient in this aspect of resource defence since the time lost in false alarms could be substantial and the failure of identifying a competitor could be very costly. How does an animal decide whether another animal is or is not a threat to a resource or a territory? Fiddler crabs [Uca vomeris (McNeill)] operate from burrows that they guard and defend vigorously against other crabs. The crabs live in dense populations, with many animals inhabiting one square metre of mudflat. We describe here the behavioural responses of foraging crabs to repeated presentations of small crab-like dummies approaching their burrows. We explore the relationship between the probability and the timing of burrow defence responses, the crab's behavioural state, and the visual appearance and direction of approach of the dummies. We find that the probability of response of resident crabs is independent of the relative position of crab and dummy but is strongly affected by the dummy's position and movement direction relative to the crab's burrow. The critical stimuli are the dummy's distance from the crab's burrow and whether the dummy is moving towards the burrow or not. The response distance (dummy-burrow distance) increases with the crab's own distance from the burrow, indicating that the crabs modify their assessment of threat depending on their own distance away from the burrow. Differences in dummy size and brightness do not affect the probability or the timing of the response. We discuss these results in the context of fiddler crab social life and, in a companion paper, identify the visual and non-visual cues involved in burrow defence.",10.1242/jeb.00632,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14555735/,Burrow surveillance in fiddler crabs I.

In conclusion, Atlantic salmon were able to maintain a high aerobic capacity and good swimming capabilities throughout the entire thermal interval tested, thus demonstrating a high level of flexibility in respiratory capacity towards different temperature exposures. Summary: A thorough assessment of metabolic rates and swimming capacity at five different acclimation temperatures, and the ecological relevance of aerobic scope models in Atlantic salmon."
283,"Oblique color vision in an open-habitat bird: spectral sensitivity, photoreceptor distribution and behavioral implications.","Color vision is not uniform across the retina because of differences in photoreceptor density and distribution. Retinal areas with a high density of cone photoreceptors may overlap with those with a high density of ganglion cells, increasing hue discrimination. However, there are some exceptions to this cell distribution pattern, particularly in species with horizontal visual streaks (bands of high ganglion cell density across the retina) that live in open habitats. We studied the spectral sensitivity and distribution of cone photoreceptors involved in chromatic and achromatic vision in the Canada goose (Branta canadiensis), which possesses an oblique rather than horizontal visual streak at the ganglion cell layer. Using microspectrophotometry, we found that the Canada goose has a violet-sensitive visual system with four visual pigments with absorbance peaks at 409, 458, 509 and 580 nm. The density of most cones involved in chromatic and achromatic vision peaked along a band across the retina that matched the oblique orientation of the visual streak. With the information on visual sensitivity, we calculated chromatic and achromatic contrasts of different goose plumage regions. The regions with the highest visual saliency (cheek, crown, neck and upper tail coverts) were the ones involved in visual displays to maintain flock cohesion. The Canada goose oblique visual streak is the retinal center for chromatic and achromatic vision, allowing individuals to sample the sky and the ground simultaneously or the horizon depending on head position. Overall, our results show that the Canada goose visual system has features that make it rather different from that of other vertebrates living in open habitats.",10.1242/jeb.073957,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22956248/,"Oblique color vision in an open-habitat bird: spectral sensitivity, photoreceptor distribution and behavioral implications","SUMMARY Color vision is not uniform across the retina because of differences in photoreceptor density and distribution.

284,"Effects of serotonergic agents on survival and hemolymph composition of the larval mosquito Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae, L.) in vivo: does serotonin regulate hemolymph acid-base homeostasis?","The role of serotonin in the regulation of larval Aedes aegypti hemolymph composition was investigated in vivo using two reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), alaproclate HCl and 6-nitroquipazine maleate, and the receptor antagonist methiothepin mesylate. Larvae were placed in media differing in pH and salinity in the presence and absence of serotonergic agents. The toxicity of each agent was strongly influenced by ambient pH. For each agent, toxicity was negligible in acidic media, intermediate in neutral media and greatest in alkaline media. By contrast, toxicity of all agents was independent of salinity.

285,Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) emit intense search calls and fly in stereotyped flight paths as they forage in the wild.,"The big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, uses echolocation for orientation and foraging, and scans its surroundings by aiming its sonar beam at obstacles and prey. All call parameters are highly adaptable and determine the bat's acoustic field of view and hence its perception of the echo scene. The intensity (source level) and directionality of the emitted calls directly contribute to the bat's acoustic field of view; however, the source level and directionality of the big brown bat's sonar signals have not been measured in the field. In addition, for bats, navigation and prey capture require that they process several streams of acoustic information. By using stereotypic flight paths in known areas, bats may be able to reduce the sensory processing load for orientation and therefore allocate echo processing resources to prey. Here we recorded the echolocation calls from foraging E. fuscus in the field with a microphone array and estimated call intensity and directionality, based on reconstructed flight trajectories. The source levels were intense with an average maximum source level of 138 dB (root mean square re. 20 µPa at 0.1 m). Furthermore, measurements taken from a subset of calls indicate that the echolocation signals in the field may be more directional than estimated in the laboratory (half-amplitude angle 30 deg at 35 kHz).

286,Flow patterns of larval fish: undulatory swimming in the intermediate flow regime.,"Fish larvae, like many adult fish, swim by undulating their body. However, their body size and swimming speeds put them in the intermediate flow regime, where viscous and inertial forces both play an important role in the interaction between fish and water. To study the influence of the relatively high viscous forces compared with adult fish, we mapped the flow around swimming zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae using two-dimensional digital particle image velocimetry (2D-DPIV) in the horizontal and transverse plane of the fish. Fish larvae initiate a swimming bout by bending their body into a C shape. During this initial tail-beat cycle, larvae shed two vortex pairs in the horizontal plane of their wake, one during the preparatory and one during the subsequent propulsive stroke. When they swim ;cyclically' (mean swimming speed does not change significantly between tail beats), fish larvae generate a wide drag wake along their head and anterior body. The flow along the posterior body is dominated by the undulating body movements that cause jet flows into the concave bends of the body wave. Patches of elevated vorticity form around the jets, and travel posteriorly along with the body wave, until they are ultimately shed at the tail near the moment of stroke reversal. Behind the larva, two vortex pairs are formed per tail-beat cycle (the tail beating once left-to-right and then right-to-left) in the horizontal plane of the larval wake. By combining transverse and horizontal cross sections of the wake, we inferred that the wake behind a cyclically swimming zebrafish larva contains two diverging rows of vortex rings to the left and right of the mean path of motion, resembling the wake of steadily swimming adult eels. When the fish larva slows down at the end of a swimming bout, it gradually reduces its tail-beat frequency and amplitude, while the separated boundary layer and drag wake of the anterior body extend posteriorly to envelope the entire larva. This drag wake is considerably wider than the larval body. The effects of the intermediate flow regime manifest as a thick boundary layer and in the quick dying-off of the larval wake within less than half a second.",10.1242/jeb.005629,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18165247/,Flow patterns of larval fish: undulatory swimming in the intermediate flow regime,"SUMMARY Fish larvae, like many adult fish, swim by undulating their body.

We found that while some participants used their relatively high natural gait variability to explore the new energetic landscape and spontaneously initiate energy optimization, most participants preferred to exploit their originally preferred, but now suboptimal, gait. We could nevertheless reliably initiate optimization in these exploiters by providing them with the experience of lower cost gaits, suggesting that the nervous system benefits from cues about the relevant dimensions along which to re-optimize its coordination. Once optimization was initiated, we found that the nervous system employed a local search process to converge on the new optimum gait over tens of seconds. Once optimization was completed, the nervous system learned to predict this new optimal gait and rapidly returned to it within a few steps if perturbed away. We then used our data to develop reinforcement learning models that can predict experimental behaviours, and applied these models to inductively reason about how the nervous system optimizes coordination.

289,Biorobotic insights into how animals swim.,"Many animals maneuver superbly underwater using their pectoral appendages. These animals range from sunfish, which have flexible, low aspect ratio fins, to penguins, which have relatively stiff, high aspect ratio wings. Biorobotics is a means of gaining insight into the mechanisms these animals use for maneuvering. In this study, experiments were carried out with models of abstracted penguin wings, and hydrodynamic characteristics -- in particular, efficiency -- were measured directly. A cross-flow vortex model of the unsteady force mechanism was developed that can compute instantaneous lift and drag forces accurately. This makes use of the steady characteristics of the fin and proposes that cross-flow drag vortices of bluff bodies in steady flow are analogous to dynamic stall vortices and that fin oscillation is a means for keeping the vortices attached to the fin. From what has been reported for sunfish with pectoral fins to our current measurements for single abstracted penguin wings, we infer that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency has remained largely unchanged. A selection algorithm was used to rapidly find the fin oscillation parameters for optimum efficiency. Finally, we compared the measurements on the penguin-like relatively stiff fins and the reported flow visualization of flexible sunfish pectoral fins. The flexible pectoral fins of station-keeping sunfish exhibit a rich repertoire of capability such as the formation of dynamic stall vortices simultaneously on two leading edges during part of the cycle, changes in projected area in different planes, and the vectoring of jets. However, such fins may not be scalable to larger biorobotic vehicles and relatively stiff fins appear to be better suited instead, albeit with somewhat limited station-keeping ability.",10.1242/jeb.012161,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18165248/,Biorobotic insights into how animals swim,"SUMMARY Many animals maneuver superbly underwater using their pectoral appendages.

The flexible pectoral fins of station-keeping sunfish exhibit a rich repertoire of capability such as the formation of dynamic stall vortices simultaneously on two leading edges during part of the cycle, changes in projected area in different planes, and the vectoring of jets.

These animals range from sunfish, which have flexible, low aspect ratio fins, to penguins, which have relatively stiff, high aspect ratio wings. Biorobotics is a means of gaining insight into the mechanisms these animals use for maneuvering. In this study, experiments were carried out with models of abstracted penguin wings, and hydrodynamic characteristics – in particular, efficiency – were measured directly. A cross-flow vortex model of the unsteady force mechanism was developed that can compute instantaneous lift and drag forces accurately. This makes use of the steady characteristics of the fin and proposes that cross-flow drag vortices of bluff bodies in steady flow are analogous to dynamic stall vortices and that fin oscillation is a means for keeping the vortices attached to the fin. From what has been reported for sunfish with pectoral fins to our current measurements for single abstracted penguin wings, we infer that the maximum hydrodynamic efficiency has remained largely unchanged.

291,A hierarchy of factors influence discontinuous gas exchange in the grasshopper Paracinema tricolor (Orthoptera: Acrididae).,"The evolutionary origin and maintenance of discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) in tracheate arthropods are poorly understood and highly controversial.

295,The predictive start of hunting archer fish: a flexible and precise motor pattern performed with the kinematics of an escape C-start.,"Once their shots have successfully dislodged aerial prey, hunting archer fish monitor the initial values of their prey's ballistic motion and elicit an adapted rapid turning maneuver. This allows these fish to head straight towards the later point of catch with a speed matched to the distance to be covered. To make the catch despite severe competition the fish must quickly and yet precisely match their turn and take-off speed to the initial values of prey motion. However, the initial variables vary over broad ranges and can be determined only after prey is dislodged. Therefore, the underlying neuronal circuitry must be able to drive a maneuver that combines a high degree of precision and flexibility at top speed. To narrow down which neuronal substrate underlies the performance we characterized the kinematics of archer fish predictive starts using digital high-speed video. Strikingly, the predictive starts show all hallmarks of Mauthner-driven teleost C-type fast-starts, which have previously not been noted in feeding strikes and were not expected to provide the high angular accuracy required. The high demands on flexibility and precision of the predictive starts do not compromise their performance.

Larvae and flow were observed simultaneously with near-infrared particle-image velocimetry, and behavior was quantified as a response to strain rate, vorticity and centripetal acceleration. Only flows rotating about a horizontal axis elicited the diving response observed previously for oyster larvae in turbulence. The results provide strong evidence that the turbulence-sensing mechanism relies on gravity-detecting organs (statocysts) rather than mechanosensors (cilia). Flow sensing with statocysts sets oyster larvae apart from zooplankters such as copepods and protists that use external mechanosensors in sensing spatial velocity gradients generated by prey or predators. Sensing flow-induced changes in orientation, rather than flow deformation, would enable more efficient control of vertical movements. Statocysts provide larvae with a mechanism of maintaining their upward swimming when rotated by vortices and initiating dives toward the seabed in response to the strong turbulence associated with adult habitats. Summary: Oyster larvae exhibit behavioral responses to flow-induced rotation of the body relative to gravity; in turbulence, these responses will enhance control of vertical motion."
297,Whole-body mechanics and gaits in the gray short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica: integrating patterns of locomotion in a semi-erect mammal.,"Gaits (footfall patterns) and external mechanical energy patterns of the center of mass were quantified in a generalized, semi-erect mammal in order to address three general questions. First, do semi-erect mammals exhibit the walk/run gait transitions that have been proposed as the primitive condition for tetrapods? Second, do small, semi-erect mammals employ the energy-saving pendular and spring-based mechanics used by erect mammals? Third, how well do mechanical locomotor patterns of the center of mass correlate with gaits? Monodelphis domestica utilizes only fast walking and running trot gaits over a fivefold increase in speed, over which we could illicit constant velocity steps, although running trots were their preferred gait. In sustained level locomotion the opossums did not use other walking gaits presumed to be primitive for tetrapods. Across the full range of speeds their trotting gaits exhibited force patterns and in-phase mechanical energy fluctuations that are characteristic of spring-mass mechanics. Thus, opossums appear to prefer trotting gaits with bouncing mechanics for sustained locomotion. Integration of center-of-mass versus footfall perspectives reveals that spring-mass mechanics is associated with both walking trot and running trot gaits. Furthermore, the onset of an aerial phase was not clearly associated with either the walk/run gait transition (50% duty factor) or a change in center-of-mass mechanics. The assumption that energy-saving mechanisms are ubiquitous among mammals is tenuous because small non-cursorial mammals do not appear to use pendular-based mechanics for sustained locomotion and, although they prefer spring-based mechanics, they probably lack clear musculoskeletal spring elements that could store energy during running.

300,"A critical analysis of carbonic anhydrase function, respiratory gas exchange, and the acid-base control of secretion in the rectal gland of Squalus acanthias.","We compared in vivo responses of rectal gland secretion to carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition (10(-4) mol l(-1) acetazolamide) in volume-loaded dogfish with in vitro responses in an isolated-perfused gland stimulated with 5 x 10(-6) mol l(-1) forskolin and removed from systemic influences. We also measured respiratory gas exchange in the perfused gland, described the acid-base status of the secreted fluid, and determined the relative importance of various extracellular and intracellular acid-base parameters in controlling rectal gland secretion in vitro. In vivo, acetazolamide inhibited Cl(-) secretion and decreased pHi in the rectal gland, but interpretation was confounded by an accompanying systemic respiratory acidosis, which would also have contributed to the inhibition. In the perfused gland, M(CO(2)) and M(O(2)) increased in linear relation to increases in Cl(-) secretion rate. CA inhibition (10(-4) mol l(-1) acetazolamide) had no effect on Cl(-) secretion rate or pHi in the perfused gland, in contrast to in vivo, but caused a transitory 30% inhibition of M(CO(2)) (relative to stable M(O(2))) and elevation in secretion P(CO(2)) effects, which peaked at 2 h and attenuated by 3.5-4 h. Secretion was inhibited by acidosis and stimulated by alkalosis; the relationship between relative Cl(-) secretion rate and pHe was almost identical to that seen in vivo. Experimental manipulations of perfusate pH, P(CO(2)) and HCO(3)(-) concentration, together with measurements of pHi, demonstrated that these responses were most strongly correlated with changes in pHe, and were not related to changes in P(CO(2)), extracellular HCO(3)(-), or intracellular HCO(3)(-) levels, though changes in pHi may also have played a role. The acid-base status of the secreted fluid varied with that of the perfusate, secretion pH remaining about 0.3-0.5 units lower, and changing in concert with pHe rather than pHi; secretion HCO(3)(-) concentrations remained low, even in the face of greatly elevated perfusate HCO(3)(-) concentrations. We conclude that pH effects on rectal gland secretion rate are adaptive, that CA functions to catalyze the hydration of CO(2), thereby maintaining a gradient for diffusive efflux of CO(2) from the working cells, and that differences in response to CA inhibition likely reflect the higher perfusion-to-secretion ratio in vitro than in vivo.",10.1242/jeb.02564,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17114403/,"A critical analysis of carbonic anhydrase function, respiratory gas exchange, and the acid-base control of secretion in the rectal gland of Squalus acanthias","SUMMARY We compared in vivo responses of rectal gland secretion to carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition (10-4 mol l-1 acetazolamide) in volume-loaded dogfish with in vitro responses in an isolated-perfused gland stimulated with 5×10-6 mol l-1 forskolin and removed from systemic influences.

303,Pre- and post-natal stress in context: effects on the stress physiology in a precocial bird.,"Developmental stress can significantly influence physiology and survival in many species. Mammalian studies suggest that pre- and post-natal stress can have different effects (i.e. hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the main mediator of the stress response. In mammals, the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring constrains the possibility to control, and therefore manipulate, maternal pre- and post-natal influences. Here, using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as our model, we elevated levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone in ovo and/or in the endogenous circulation of hatchlings. We examined the effects of treatments on corticosterone and glucose stress responses at two different ages, in juvenile and adult quail. In juveniles, corticosterone data revealed a sex-specific effect of post-natal treatment regardless of the previous pre-natal protocol, with post-natally treated females showing shorter stress responses in comparison with the other groups, while no differences were observed among males. In adulthood, birds previously stressed as embryos showed higher corticosterone concentrations over the stress response compared with controls. This effect was not evident in birds subjected to either post-natal treatment or the combined treatments. There were no effects on glucose in the juveniles. However, adult birds previously stressed in ovo showed opposite sex-specific basal glucose patterns compared with the other groups. Our results demonstrate that (1) early glucocorticoid exposure can have both transient and long-term effects on the HPA axis, depending upon the developmental stage and sex and (2) post-natal stress can modulate the effects of pre-natal stress on HPA activity.",10.1242/jeb.071423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22899536/,Pre- and post-natal stress in context: effects on the stress physiology in a precocial bird,"SUMMARY Developmental stress can significantly influence physiology and survival in many species.

In adulthood, birds previously stressed as embryos showed higher corticosterone concentrations over the stress response compared with controls. This effect was not evident in birds subjected to either post-natal treatment or the combined treatments. There were no effects on glucose in the juveniles. However, adult birds previously stressed in ovo showed opposite sex-specific basal glucose patterns compared with the other groups. Our results demonstrate that (1) early glucocorticoid exposure can have both transient and long-term effects on the HPA axis, depending upon the developmental stage and sex and (2) post-natal stress can modulate the effects of pre-natal stress on HPA activity.",True,"Developmental stress can significantly influence physiology and survival in many species. Mammalian studies suggest that pre- and post-natal stress can have different effects (i.e. hyper- or hypo-responsiveness) on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, the main mediator of the stress response. In mammals, the physiological intimacy between mother and offspring constrains the possibility to control, and therefore manipulate, maternal pre- and post-natal influences. Here, using the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as our model, we elevated levels of the glucocorticoid stress hormone corticosterone in ovo and/or in the endogenous circulation of hatchlings. We examined the effects of treatments on corticosterone and glucose stress responses at two different ages, in juvenile and adult quail.

304,A false killer whale adjusts its hearing when it echolocates.,"The use of auditory evoked potential (AEP) measurements has added considerably to knowledge of the hearing mechanisms of marine mammals. We have recently measured the hearing of a stranded infant Risso's dolphin, the audiograms of white-beaked dolphins temporarily caught and released, and the hearing of anaesthetized polar bears. Most small toothed whales echolocate and hear very high frequency sounds underwater. While much has previously been learned about the echolocation performance and characteristics of the outgoing signals of echolocating dolphins and small whales, the hearing processes occurring while these animals actively echolocate have not previously been examined. Working with a well-trained echolocating false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) wearing latex surface suction cup electrodes, we have measured echolocation hearing AEPs in response to outgoing echolocation clicks, returning echoes, and comparable simulated whale clicks and echoes in a variety of situations. We have found that: (1) the whale may hear her loud outgoing clicks and much quieter returning echoes at comparable levels, (2) the whale has protective mechanisms that dampen the intensity of her outgoing signals - she hears her outgoing signals at a level about 40 dB lower than similar signals presented directly in front of her, (3) when echo return levels are lowered either by making the targets smaller or by placing the targets farther away - without changing the levels of her outgoing signals - the hearing of these echoes remains at almost the same level, (4) if targets are made much smaller and harder to echolocate, the animal will modify what she hears of her outgoing signal - as if to heighten overall hearing sensitivity to keep the echo level hearable, (5) the animal has an active 'automatic gain control' mechanism in her hearing based on both forward masking that balances outgoing pulse intensity and time between pulse and echo, and active hearing control.

312,Controlled feeding trials with ungulates: a new application of in vivo dental molding to assess the abrasive factors of microwear.,"Microwear, the quantification of microscopic scratches and pits on the occlusal surfaces of tooth enamel, is commonly used as a paleodietary proxy. For ungulates (hoofed mammals), scratch-dominant microwear distinguishes modern grazers from browsers, presumably as a result of abrasion from grass phytoliths (biogenic silica). However, it is also likely that exogenous grit (i.e. soil, dust) is a contributing factor to these scratch-dominant patterns, which may reflect soil ingestion that varies with feeding height and/or environmental conditions (e.g. dust production in open and/or arid habitats). This study assessed the contribution of exogenous grit to tooth wear by measuring the effects of fine- and medium-grained silica sand on tooth enamel using a novel live-animal tooth-molding technique. It therefore constitutes the first controlled feeding experiment using ungulates and the first in vivo experiment using abrasives of different sizes. Four sheep were fed three diet treatments: (1) a mixture of Garrison and Brome hay (control), (2) hay treated with fine-grained silica sand (180-250 µm) and (3) hay treated with medium-grained silica sand (250-425 µm). We found a significant increase in pit features that was correlated with an increase in grain size of grit, corroborating earlier chewing simulation experiments that produced pits through grit-induced abrasion (i.e. the 'grit effect'). Our results support an interpretation of large silica grains fracturing to create smaller, more abundant angular particles capable of abrasion, with jaw movement defining feature shape (i.e. scratch or pit).

313,Effects of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids on mitochondrial metabolism in mammalian hibernation.,"Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) were fed one of four isocaloric, isolipemic diets containing 16, 22, 35 or 55 mg linoleic acid (18:2n-6) per gram. Mitochondrial properties were compared between hibernating and summer active states, and between diet groups. As in other studies, state 3 respiration was significantly reduced in hibernation, but only in animals fed the 22 mg g(-1) 18:2 diet. In the other diet groups, there was no difference in state 3 respiration between the hibernating and summer active groups.

However, for all other diet groups, mitochondrial proton conductance was significantly reduced during hibernation. Mitochondrial phospholipid fatty acids changed significantly with hibernation, including increases in unsaturation indices and n-6/n-3, but no differences were found among diet groups. Mitochondrial proton conductance in hibernation showed a positive correlation with the content of linoleic acid (18:2) and arachidonic acid (20:4) in mitochondrial phospholipids. Lipid peroxidation was higher in mitochondria from hibernating animals, probably due to higher unsaturation, but there was no effect of dietary 18:2 on this pattern.

We provide the first measurements of the effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on transepithelial potential (TEP), luminal ion concentrations and electrochemical potentials, as well as basolateral membrane potential and H+, Na+ and K+ fluxes. TEP, basolateral membrane potential, and H+, K+ and Na+ fluxes across the gastric caeca declined within 3–6 min after isolation of the entire midgut from the larva. 5-HT restored both the TEP and active accumulation of H+, K+ and Na+ in the lumen. Additionally, 5-HT restored H+, K+ and Na+ fluxes across the distal caecum of freshwater larvae, and restored H+ fluxes across the distal caecum of brackish water larvae. There was no effect of 5-HT on ion fluxes across the proximal caecum. We have also shown that 5-HT restores the basolateral membrane potential in cells of the distal, but not proximal, caecum. Effects of 5-HT on TEP and basolateral membrane potential were mimicked by application of cAMP but not by a phorbol ester. We provide a working model which proposes that 5-HT and cAMP stimulate the vacuolar H+-ATPase of the distal caecum. Our results provide evidence that the gastric caecum is functionally distinct from the adjacent anterior midgut and we discuss possible roles of the gastric caecum in osmoregulation.

317,Membrane lipid physiology and toxin catabolism underlie ethanol and acetic acid tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Drosophila melanogaster has evolved the ability to tolerate and utilize high levels of ethanol and acetic acid encountered in its rotting-fruit niche.

320,Plasticity of muscle fibre number in seawater stages of Atlantic salmon in response to photoperiod manipulation.,"Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were fed to satiety and reared from approximately 60 g to 5000 g at ambient seawater temperatures. The effect of photoperiod manipulation on muscle growth was investigated from the start of the first sea winter. Continuous light treatment in winter/spring (1 November to 18 June) improved growth performance in fish, resulting in a 30% increase in mean body mass relative to the ambient photoperiod fish by 12 August, but had no effect on sexual maturation. Significant increases in body mass in the continuous light groups were observed after 126 days (P<0.01).

323,Vocal tract articulation revisited: the case of the monk parakeet.,"Birdsong and human speech share many features with respect to vocal learning and development. However, the vocal production mechanisms have long been considered to be distinct. The vocal organ of songbirds is more complex than the human larynx, leading to the hypothesis that vocal variation in birdsong originates mainly at the sound source, while in humans it is primarily due to vocal tract filtering. However, several recent studies have indicated the importance of vocal tract articulators such as the beak and oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity. In contrast to most other bird groups, parrots have a prominent tongue, raising the possibility that tongue movements may also be of significant importance in vocal production in parrots, but evidence is rare and observations often anecdotal. In the current study we used X-ray cinematographic imaging of naturally vocalizing monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) to assess which articulators are possibly involved in vocal tract filtering in this species. We observed prominent tongue height changes, beak opening movements and tracheal length changes, which suggests that all of these components play an important role in modulating vocal tract resonance. Moreover, the observation of tracheal shortening as a vocal articulator in live birds has to our knowledge not been described before. We also found strong positive correlations between beak opening and amplitude as well as changes in tongue height and amplitude in several types of vocalization. Our results suggest considerable differences between parrot and songbird vocal production while at the same time the parrot's vocal articulation might more closely resemble human speech production in the sense that both make extensive use of the tongue as a vocal articulator.",10.1242/jeb.064717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22162856,Vocal tract articulation revisited: the case of the monk parakeet,"SUMMARY Birdsong and human speech share many features with respect to vocal learning and development.

325,Intrinsic mechanical properties of the perfused armoured catfish heart with special reference to the effects of hypercapnic acidosis on maximum cardiac performance.,"The armoured catfish, Pterygoplichthys pardalis, is known to be extremely tolerant of environmental hypercarbia (elevated water CO(2) tensions), which occurs in their natural environment. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that during exposure to hypercarbia, P. pardalis does not exhibit extracellular pH compensation and thus the heart and other organs must continue to function despite a severe extracellular acidosis. We used an in situ perfused heart preparation to determine the effects of an extracellular hypercapnic (elevated CO(2) in the animal) acidosis (1-7.5% CO(2)) on heart function, specifically cardiac output, power output, heart rate and stroke volume. The present study is the first to comprehensively examine cardiac function in an acidosis-tolerant teleost. When compared with control conditions, maximum cardiac performance was unaffected at levels of CO(2) as high as 5%, far exceeding the hypercapnic tolerance of other teleosts. Moreover, P. pardalis exhibited only a moderate decrease (approximately 35%) in cardiac performance when exposed to 7.5% CO(2), and full cardiac performance was restored in six out of seven hearts upon return to control conditions. Myocardial intracellular pH (pH(i)) was protected in situ, as has been found in vivo, and this protection extended to the highest level of CO(2) (7.5%) investigated. Thus, maintained heart function during a hypercapnic acidosis in P. pardalis is probably associated with preferential pH(i) regulation of the heart, but ultimately is not sufficient to prevent loss of cardiac function.

327,Mechanical and optical properties of the femoral chordotonal organ in beetles (Coleoptera).,"The femoral chordotonal organ (FCO) in beetles differs from that in orthopterids in the origin of its apodeme: it originates directly from the tibia in the latter, but amidst the tendon of the extensor muscle in the former.

The turn of the arculum is several times more than the turn of the tibia, and the arculum is connected to the FCO. This system behaves as a high-pass filter with a time constant close to the step period. Various aspects of the arculum have been studied previously, including its shape in various taxa, its biomechanics, matched neural activity in the FCO, as well as evolutionary aspects.

Recently, we minimized the system to three components: the proximal tibial ledge, the tendon and the arculum. The elastic tendon contains resilin. In four model species, the arculum readily turned upon stretching of the tendon. Turning was video recorded. The force of approximately 0.005 N, applied to a tendon approximately 0.25 mm in size, is enough for the utmost turn of the arculum. The arculum turned also upon local deformations close to its base. The ability to turn vanished after incision between the arculum and the distal part of the extensor apodeme. A mechanical model of an amplifier is proposed.

In four model species, the arculum readily turned upon stretching of the tendon. Turning was video recorded. The force of approximately 0.005 N, applied to a tendon approximately 0.25 mm in size, is enough for the utmost turn of the arculum. The arculum turned also upon local deformations close to its base. The ability to turn vanished after incision between the arculum and the distal part of the extensor apodeme. A mechanical model of an amplifier is proposed. The apodeme includes optically active structures, which behave differently in polarized light. Summary: Unique among insects, the femoral chordotonal organs in many beetles have a special design of the apodeme for amplification of dynamic signals.",True,"The femoral chordotonal organ (FCO) in beetles differs from that in orthopterids in the origin of its apodeme: it originates directly from the tibia in the latter, but amidst the tendon of the extensor muscle in the former. In many beetles, the apodeme pops up from the tendon as a short sclerite (arculum). It turns distally upon bending of the tibia. The turn of the arculum is several times more than the turn of the tibia, and the arculum is connected to the FCO. This system behaves as a high-pass filter with a time constant close to the step period. Various aspects of the arculum have been studied previously, including its shape in various taxa, its biomechanics, matched neural activity in the FCO, as well as evolutionary aspects.

328,"Silicon-based plant defences, tooth wear and voles.","Plant-herbivore interactions are hypothesized to drive vole population cycles through the grazing-induced production of phytoliths in leaves. Phytoliths act as mechanical defences because they deter herbivory and lower growth rates in mammals. However, how phytoliths impair herbivore performance is still unknown. Here, we tested whether the amount of phytoliths changes tooth wear patterns. If confirmed, abrasion from phytoliths could play a role in population crashes. We applied dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to laboratory and wild voles. Lab voles were fed two pelleted diets with differing amounts of silicon, which produced similar dental textures. This was most probably due to the loss of food mechanical properties through pelletization and/or the small difference in silicon concentration between diets. Wild voles were trapped in Poland during spring and summer, and every year across a population cycle. In spring, voles feed on silica-rich monocotyledons, while in the summer they also include silica-depleted dicotyledons. This was reflected in the results; the amount of silica therefore leaves a traceable record in the dental microwear texture of voles. Furthermore, voles from different phases of population cycles have different microwear textures. We tentatively propose that these differences result from grazing-induced phytolith concentrations. We hypothesize that the high amount of phytoliths in response to intense grazing in peak years may result in malocclusion and other dental abnormalities, which would explain how these silicon-based plant defences help provoke population crashes. DMTA could then be used to reconstruct vole population dynamics using teeth from pellets or palaeontological material.

329,Feather roughness reduces flow separation during low Reynolds number glides of swifts.,"Swifts are aerodynamically sophisticated birds with a small arm and large hand wing that provides them with exquisite control over their glide performance. However, their hand wings have a seemingly unsophisticated surface roughness that is poised to disturb flow. This roughness of about 2% chord length is formed by the valleys and ridges of overlapping primary feathers with thick protruding rachides, which make the wing stiffer. An earlier flow study of laminar-turbulent boundary layer transition over prepared swift wings suggested that swifts can attain laminar flow at a low angle of attack. In contrast, aerodynamic design theory suggests that airfoils must be extremely smooth to attain such laminar flow. In hummingbirds, which have similarly rough wings, flow measurements on a 3D printed model suggest that the flow separates at the leading edge and becomes turbulent well above the rachis bumps in a detached shear layer. The aerodynamic function of wing roughness in small birds is, therefore, not fully understood. Here, we performed particle image velocimetry and force measurements to compare smooth versus rough 3D-printed models of the swift hand wing. The high-resolution boundary layer measurements show that the flow over rough wings is indeed laminar at a low angle of attack and a low Reynolds number, but becomes turbulent at higher values. In contrast, the boundary layer over the smooth wing forms open laminar separation bubbles that extend beyond the trailing edge. The boundary layer dynamics of the smooth surface varies non-linearly as a function of angle of attack and Reynolds number, whereas the rough surface boasts more consistent turbulent boundary layer dynamics. Comparison of the corresponding drag values, lift values and glide ratios suggests, however, that glide performance is equivalent. The increased structural performance, boundary layer robustness and equivalent aerodynamic performance of rough wings might have provided small (proto) birds with an evolutionary window to high glide performance.

331,The influence of photosynthesis on host intracellular pH in scleractinian corals.,"The regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) is a fundamental aspect of cell physiology that has received little attention in studies of reef-building corals and symbiotic cnidarians. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that dynamic changes in the pHi of coral host cells are controlled by the photosynthetic activity of the coral's dinoflagellate symbionts. Using live cell imaging and the pH-sensitive dye SNARF-1, we tracked pH in symbiont-containing and symbiont-free cells isolated from the reef coral Stylophora pistillata. We characterised the response of coral pHi in the presence of a photosynthetic inhibitor, the dynamics of coral pHi during light exposure and how pHi values vary on exposure to a range of irradiance levels lying within the coral's photosynthesis-irradiance response curve. Our results demonstrate that increases in coral pHi are dependent on photosynthetic activity of intracellular symbionts and that pHi recovers under darkness to values that match those of symbiont-free cells. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the pHi response is governed by irradiance level and that pHi increases to irradiance-specific steady-state values. Minimum steady-state pHi values of 7.05 ± 0.05 were obtained under darkness and maximum values of 7.46 ± 0.07 were obtained under saturating irradiance. As changes in pHi often affect organism homeostasis, there is a need for continued research into acid/base regulation in symbiotic corals.

The low infection rate of eggs of one species in particular, the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg contents than chicken eggs.

The present study describes (1) the mechanical energy fluctuations of the body centre-of-mass (BCOM) as a reflection of the whole-body dynamics and (2) the joint kinematics and kinetics. Consistent with previous research, the spatiotemporal variables showed a sudden switch from walking to running in one transition step. During this step there was a sudden increase in forward speed, the so-called speed jump (0.42 m s(-1)). At total body level, this was reflected in a sudden increase in energy of the BCOM (0.83±0.14 J kg(-1)) and an abrupt change from an out-of-phase to an in-phase organization of the kinetic and potential energy fluctuations. During the transition step a larger net propulsive impulse compared with the preceding and following steps was observed due to a decrease in the braking impulse. This suggests that the altered landing configuration (prepared during the last 40% of the preceding swing) places the body in an optimal configuration to minimize this braking impulse. We hypothesize this configuration also evokes a reflex allowing a more powerful push off, which generates enough power to complete the transition and launch the first flight phase.

335,The dive response redefined: underwater behavior influences cardiac variability in freely diving dolphins.,"A hallmark of the dive response, bradycardia, promotes the conservation of onboard oxygen stores and enables marine mammals to submerge for prolonged periods. A paradox exists when marine mammals are foraging underwater because activity should promote an elevation in heart rate (f(H)) to support increased metabolic demands. To assess the effect of the interaction between the diving response and underwater activity on f(H), we integrated interbeat f(H) with behavioral observations of adult bottlenose dolphins diving and swimming along the coast of the Bahamas. As expected for the dive response, f(H) while resting during submergence (40±6 beats min(-1)) was significantly lower than f(H) while resting at the water surface (105±8 beats min(-1)). The maximum recorded f(H) (f(H,max)) was 128±7 beats min(-1), and occurred during post-dive surface intervals. During submergence, the level of bradycardia was modified by activity. Behaviors such as simple head bobbing at depth increased f(H) by 40% from submerged resting levels. Higher heart rates were observed for horizontal swimming at depth. Indeed, the dolphins operated at 37-58% of their f(H,max) while active at depth and approached 57-79% of their f(H,max) during anticipatory tachycardia as the animals glided to the surface. f(H) was significantly correlated with stroke frequency (range=0-2.5 strokes s(-1), r=0.88, N=25 dives) and calculated swim speed (range=0-5.4 m s(-1), r=0.88, N=25 dives).

As expected for the dive response, fH while resting during submergence (40±6 beats min−1) was significantly lower than fH while resting at the water surface (105±8 beats min−1). The maximum recorded fH (fH,max) was 128±7 beats min−1, and occurred during post-dive surface intervals. During submergence, the level of bradycardia was modified by activity. Behaviors such as simple head bobbing at depth increased fH by 40% from submerged resting levels. Higher heart rates were observed for horizontal swimming at depth. Indeed, the dolphins operated at 37–58% of their fH,max while active at depth and approached 57–79% of their fH,max during anticipatory tachycardia as the animals glided to the surface. fH was significantly correlated with stroke frequency (range=0–2.5 strokes s−1, r=0.88, N=25 dives) and calculated swim speed (range=0–5.4 m s−1, r=0.88, N=25 dives).

336,On the importance of radiative heat exchange during nocturnal flight in birds.,"Many migratory flights take place during cloudless nights, thus under conditions where the sky temperature can commonly be 20 degrees C below local air temperature. The sky then acts as a radiative sink, leading objects exposed to it to have a lower surface temperature than unexposed ones because less infrared energy is received from the sky than from the surfaces that are isothermic to air. To investigate the significance of this effect for heat dissipation during nocturnal flight in birds, we built a wind tunnel with the facility to control wall temperature (TASK) and air temperature (TAIR) independently at air speeds (UWIN) comparable to flying speeds. We used it to measure the influence of TASK, TAIR and UWIN on plumage and skin temperatures in pigeons having to dissipate a thermal load while constrained at rest in a flight posture. Our results show that the temperature of the flight and insulation plumages exposed to a radiative sink can be accurately described by multiple regression models (r2>0.96) based only on TAIR, TASK and UWIN. Predictions based on these models indicate that while convection dominates heat loss for a plumage exposed to air moving at flight speed in a thermally uniform environment, radiation may dominate in the presence of a radiative sink comparable to a clear sky. Our data also indicate that reducing TASK to a temperature 20 degrees C below TAIR can increase the temperature difference across the exposed plumage by at least 13% and thus facilitate heat flow through the main thermal resistance to the loss of internally produced heat in birds. While extrapolation from our experimentally constrained conditions to free flight in the atmosphere is difficult, our results suggest that the sky temperature has been a neglected factor in determining the range of TAIR over which prolonged flight is possible.",10.1242/jeb.01964,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16354782/,On the importance of radiative heat exchange during nocturnal flight in birds,"SUMMARY Many migratory flights take place during cloudless nights, thus under conditions where the sky temperature can commonly be 20°C below local air temperature.

The current study examined how auditory function in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a vocal teleost, co-varied with sex, reproductive condition and female plasma 17β-estradiol level. Auditory evoked potentials were collected in response to tone pips (100-600 Hz) and a natural round goby pulse vocalization. Additionally, saccule hair cell densities were compared across reproductive groups. Auditory threshold was evaluated in terms of pressure and particle acceleration, and response amplitude and onset latency were measured at 10 dB above threshold. Relative to males, females displayed lower auditory thresholds in response to the natural vocalization and to tones at 300-600 Hz, and had a higher density of saccule hair cells. The 17β-estradiol level was positively associated with amplitude and latency for the pulse stimulus and with both threshold and amplitude for tones at 100-200 Hz in females. Relative to non-reproductive males, reproductive males exhibited longer response latencies at 100-200 Hz. The results demonstrate sexual dimorphism in auditory function in a teleost fish as well as intra-sexual variation, partially based on hormone levels.

338,When vortices stick: an aerodynamic transition in tiny insect flight.,"We have used computational fluid dynamics to study changes in lift generation and vortex dynamics for Reynolds numbers (Re) between 8 and 128. The immersed boundary method was used to model a two-dimensional wing through one stroke cycle. We calculated lift and drag coefficients as a function of time and related changes in lift to the shedding or attachment of the leading and trailing edge vortices. We find that the fluid dynamics around the wing fall into two distinct patterns. For Re> or =64, leading and trailing edge vortices are alternately shed behind the wing, forming the von Karman vortex street. For Re< or =32, the leading and trailing edge vortices remain attached to the wing during each 'half stroke'. In three-dimensional studies, large lift forces are produced by 'vortical asymmetry' when the leading edge vortex remains attached to the wing for the duration of each half stroke and the trailing edge vortex is shed. Our two-dimensional study suggests that this asymmetry is lost for Re below some critical value (between 32 and 64), resulting in lower lift forces.

339,Dual inhibition of the dactyl opener muscle in lobster.,"The dactyl opener neuromuscular system of crayfish and lobster has long been a popular model system for studies of synaptic physiology and its modulation. Previous studies of its neural innervation in both species have reported that whereas the opener excitor axon (OE) and the specific opener inhibitor (OI) innervate the entire muscle, the common inhibitor (CI) is restricted to a small number of the most proximal muscle fibers and is the physiologically weaker of the two inhibitors. Here, we show in the lobster that, contrary to previous reports, CI innervates fibers along the entire extent of the dactyl opener muscle and thus shares the innervation targets of OE and OI. To characterize the physiological function of CI in the lobster dactyl opener system, we independently stimulated both OI and CI and compared their effects. The physiological impact of each inhibitor was similar: inhibitors elicit inhibitory junction potentials of similar sizes, both trigger muscle relaxations and both inhibit excitatory junction potentials and muscle contractions to a comparable extent. Thus, in the periphery, CI and OI appear to be equally powerful inhibitors with similar physiological roles, both in suppressing contractions triggered by the excitor OE and in directly relaxing muscle tension. In light of these observations, our understanding of the physiological roles of specific and common inhibitors in crustacean motor control requires reevaluation.",10.1242/jeb.02114,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16574798/,Dual inhibition of the dactyl opener muscle in lobster,"SUMMARY The dactyl opener neuromuscular system of crayfish and lobster has long been a popular model system for studies of synaptic physiology and its modulation.

The crystalline lens plays a central role in the visual pathway and hence the ecology of fishes. In this study, we tested whether the different light regimes in the Mediterranean and Red Seas have an effect on the optical properties of the lenses in the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus. This species has migrated through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea and established a vital population in the Mediterranean Sea. Longitudinal spherical aberration curves and focal lengths of the fish lenses were measured by laser scans and compared between the two populations. In addition, rivulated rabbitfish from the Mediterranean Sea were exposed to colored light (yellow, green and blue) and unfiltered light for periods of 1 or 13 days to test for short-term adjustments. Lens focal length was significantly longer (3%) in the Rea Sea population. The shorter focal length of the Mediterranean population can be explained as an adaptation to the dimmer light environment, as this difference makes the Mediterranean eyes 5% more sensitive than the eyes of the Red Sea population. The difference may be due to genetic differences or, more likely, adaptive developmental plasticity.

341,The relationship of head movements to semicircular canal size in cetaceans.,"The semicircular canals measure head rotations, providing information critical for maintaining equilibrium. The canals of cetaceans (including whales, dolphins and porpoises) are extraordinarily small, making them unique exceptions to the allometric relationship shared by all other vertebrates between canal size and animal mass. Most modern cetaceans have shorter and less flexible necks than those of their ancestors, an adaptation hypothesized to have led to exaggerated head movements during locomotion. These movements are thought to have necessitated a decrease in the size and sensitivity of the canals, increasing their operating range to accommodate increased head motion. We tested whether the size of the semicircular canals in cetaceans is related to their head movements by comparing the rotational head velocities, frequencies and accelerations of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and a terrestrial relative, cattle (Bos taurus), using an array of three orthogonal head-fixed miniaturized rotational ratemeters. We collected data during typical locomotion (swimming; trotting) and during behaviors with enhanced head movements (rapid spiraling underwater; bucking). Cattle head movements always exceeded those of dolphins. Maximum head velocities were 528 deg. s(-1) in dolphins and 534 deg. s(-1) in cattle; maximum head frequencies were 2.86 Hz in dolphins and 3.45 Hz in cattle; and maximum head accelerations were 5253 deg. s(-2) in dolphins and 10,880 deg. s(-2) in cattle.

We found that calcium responses to the learned odor and an odor that was strongly generalized with it were enhanced compared with responses to a weakly generalized control. Thus, the physiological responses measured in these extrinsic neurons accurately reflect what is observed in behavior. We conclude that the recorded recurrent neurons feed information back to the mushroom body about the features of learned odor stimuli. Other extrinsic neurons may signal information about learned odors to different brain regions."
344,Prolonged fasting does not increase oxidative damage or inflammation in postweaned northern elephant seal pups.,"Elephant seals are naturally adapted to survive up to three months of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting). Prolonged food deprivation in terrestrial mammals increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative damage and inflammation that can be induced by an increase in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). To test the hypothesis that prolonged fasting in elephant seals is not associated with increased oxidative stress or inflammation, blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected from early (2-3 weeks post-weaning) and late (7-8 weeks post-weaning) fasted seals. Plasma levels of oxidative damage, inflammatory markers and plasma renin activity (PRA), along with muscle levels of lipid and protein oxidation, were compared between early and late fasting periods. Protein expression of angiotensin receptor 1 (AT(1)), pro-oxidant (Nox4) and antioxidant enzymes (CuZn- and Mn-superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidase and catalase) was analyzed in muscle. Fasting induced a 2.5-fold increase in PRA, a 50% increase in AT(1), a twofold increase in Nox4 and a 70% increase in NADPH oxidase activity. By contrast, neither tissue nor systemic indices of oxidative damage or inflammation increased with fasting. Furthermore, muscle antioxidant enzymes increased 40-60% with fasting in parallel with an increase in muscle and red blood cell antioxidant enzyme activities. These data suggest that, despite the observed increases in RAS and Nox4, an increase in antioxidant enzymes appears to be sufficient to suppress systemic and tissue indices of oxidative damage and inflammation in seals that have fasted for a prolonged period. The present study highlights the importance of antioxidant capacity in mammals during chronic periods of stress to help avoid deleterious systemic consequences.",10.1242/jeb.041335,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20581282,Prolonged fasting does not increase oxidative damage or inflammation in postweaned northern elephant seal pups,"SUMMARY Elephant seals are naturally adapted to survive up to three months of absolute food and water deprivation (fasting).

345,Cationic pathway of pH regulation in larvae of Anopheles gambiae.,"Anopheles gambiae larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) live in freshwater with low Na(+) concentrations yet they use Na(+) for alkalinization of the alimentary canal, for electrophoretic amino acid uptake and for nerve function. The metabolic pathway by which larvae accomplish these functions has anionic and cationic components that interact and allow the larva to conserve Na(+) while excreting H(+) and HCO(3)(-). The anionic pathway consists of a metabolic CO(2) diffusion process, carbonic anhydrase and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchangers; it provides weak HCO(3)(-) and weaker CO(3)(2-) anions to the lumen. The cationic pathway consists of H(+) V-ATPases and Na(+)/H(+) antiporters (NHAs), Na(+)/K(+) P-ATPases and Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) along with several (Na(+) or K(+)):amino acid(+/-) symporters, a.k.a. nutrient amino acid transporters (NATs). This paper considers the cationic pathway, which provides the strong Na(+) or K(+) cations that alkalinize the lumen in anterior midgut then removes them and restores a lower pH in posterior midgut. A key member of the cationic pathway is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, which was cloned recently from Anopheles gambiae larvae, localized strategically in plasma membranes of the alimentary canal and named AgNHA1 based upon its phylogeny. A phylogenetic comparison of all cloned NHAs and NHEs revealed that AgNHA1 is the first metazoan NHA to be cloned and localized and that it is in the same clade as electrophoretic prokaryotic NHAs that are driven by the electrogenic H(+) F-ATPase. Like prokaryotic NHAs, AgNHA1 is thought to be electrophoretic and to be driven by the electrogenic H(+) V-ATPase. Both AgNHA1 and alkalophilic bacterial NHAs face highly alkaline environments; to alkalinize the larva mosquito midgut lumen, AgNHA1, like the bacterial NHAs, would have to move nH(+) inwardly and Na(+) outwardly. Perhaps the alkaline environment that led to the evolution of electrophoretic prokaryotic NHAs also led to the evolution of an electrophoretic AgNHA1 in mosquito larvae. In support of this hypothesis, antibodies to both AgNHA1 and H(+) V-ATPase label the same membranes in An. gambiae larvae. The localization of H(+) V-ATPase together with (Na(+) or K(+)):amino acid(+/-) symporter, AgNAT8, on the same apical membrane in posterior midgut cells constitutes the functional equivalent of an NHE that lowers the pH in the posterior midgut lumen. All NATs characterized to date are Na(+) or K(+) symporters so the deduction is likely to have wide application. The deduced colocalization of H(+) V-ATPase, AgNHA1 and AgNAT8, on this membrane forms a pathway for local cycling of H(+) and Na(+) in posterior midgut. The local H(+) cycle would prevent unchecked acidification of the lumen while the local Na(+) cycle would regulate pH and support Na(+):amino acid(+/-) symport. Meanwhile, a long-range Na(+) cycle first transfers Na(+) from the blood to gastric caeca and anterior midgut lumen where it initiates alkalinization and then returns Na(+) from the rectal lumen to the blood, where it prevents loss of Na(+) during H(+) and HCO(3)(-) excretion. The localization of H(+) V-ATPase and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in An. gambiae larvae parallels that reported for Aedes aegypti larvae.

346,Inhibition of the oxidative stress response by heat stress in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"It has long been recognized that simultaneous exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress shows a synergistic interaction that reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying this interaction. We investigated the role of molecular stress responses in driving this synergistic interaction using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans To induce oxidative stress, we used the pro-oxidant compounds acrylamide, paraquat and juglone. As expected, we found that heat stress and oxidative stress interact synergistically to reduce survival. Compared with exposure to each stressor alone, during simultaneous sublethal exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress the normal induction of key oxidative-stress response (OxSR) genes was generally inhibited, whereas the induction of key heat-shock response (HSR) genes was not. Genetically activating the SKN-1-dependent OxSR increased a marker for protein aggregation and decreased whole-worm survival during heat stress alone, with the latter being independent of HSF-1. In contrast, compared with wild-type worms, inactivating the HSR by HSF-1 knockdown, which would be expected to decrease basal heat shock protein expression, increased survival during oxidative stress alone. Taken together, these data suggest that, in C. elegans, the HSR and OxSR cannot be simultaneously activated to the same extent that each can be activated during a single stressor exposure. We conclude that the observed synergistic reduction in survival during combined exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress is due, at least in part, to inhibition of the OxSR during activation of the HSR.",10.1242/jeb.135327,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207646/,Inhibition of the oxidative stress response by heat stress in Caenorhabditis elegans,"ABSTRACT It has long been recognized that simultaneous exposure to heat stress and oxidative stress shows a synergistic interaction that reduces organismal fitness, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms underlying this interaction.

347,Diurnal oscillation of vocal development associated with clustered singing by juvenile songbirds.,"Spaced practice affects learning efficiency in humans and other animals. However, it is not well understood how spaced practice contributes to learning during development. Here, we show the behavioral significance of singing frequency in song development in a songbird, the zebra finch. Songbirds learn a complex song pattern by trial-and-error vocalizations as self-motivated practice, which is executed over a thousand times per day during the sensitive period of vocal learning. Notably, juveniles generate songs with a high frequency of singing in clusters with dense singing, whereas adults sing with low frequency in short clusters. This juvenile-specific clustered singing was characterized by clear separations of daily time for intense practice and rest. During the epochs of vocal practice in juveniles, the song structure approached that of song produced at the end of the day. In contrast, during the epochs of vocal rest, the structure of juvenile songs regressed toward that of songs produced at the beginning of the day, indicating a dynamic progression and regression of song development over the course of the day. When the singing frequency was manipulated to decrease it at the juvenile stage, the oscillation rate of song development was dramatically reduced. Although the juvenile-specific clustered singing occurred in non-tutored socially isolated birds or those with auditory deprivation, the diurnal oscillation of vocal development was only observed in non-tutored isolated juveniles. These results show the impact of 'self-motivated' vocal practice on diurnal song developmental plasticity, modulated by the amount of vocal output and auditory feedback.

348,Muscle strain is modulated more with running slope than speed in wild turkey knee and hip extensors.,"We examined the length changes and electromyographic (EMG) activity of two hindlimb muscles in wild turkeys, to determine how these muscles modulate mechanical function with changes in running speed and slope. The muscles studied were the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO), a biarticular knee and hip extensor, and the femorotibialis lateralis (FT), a knee extensor. Muscle length changes were recorded using sonomicrometry, and EMG activity was recorded from indwelling bipolar electrodes as the animals walked and ran at a range of speeds (1-3.5 m s(-1)). Treadmill slope was also varied, from a 12 degrees uphill slope to a downhill slope of -12 degrees. To test the hypothesis that the strain pattern in active muscles reflects the demand for mechanical work, we compared strain in the ILPO and FT across the range of slopes. Both muscles underwent active lengthen-shorten cycles during stance. We analyzed the lengthening and shortening part of the strain pattern separately to determine the response of muscle strain to surface slope. In both muscles stance phase shortening strain increased over the range of slopes studied, from 7.8+/-3.5% (ILPO) and 1.9+/-2.2% (FT) during downhill running at -12 degrees, to 30.3+/-3.9% (ILPO) and 8.2+/-5.6% (FT) during uphill running at 12 degrees. Stance-phase lengthening strain was also modulated with slope, from -15.6+/-3.2% (ILPO) and -22.1+/-9.6% (FT) during downhill running at -12 degrees, to -4.2+/-2.5% (ILPO) and -9.0+/-5.6% (FT) during uphill running at 12 degrees. The results suggest that for the ILPO and FT a change in net mechanical work output with running slope is likely mediated by a change in both the lengthening, energy absorbing portion of the contraction and the shortening, energy producing part of the contraction. We also found changes in the timing of EMG activity, and the relative portion of the stance period spent lengthening, which were consistent with a shift in muscle function from energy absorption during downhill running, to net energy production during uphill running. Generally, muscle strain was less affected by speed than by slope. Shortening strains were not significantly correlated with running speed. Only FT lengthening strain changed significantly with speed, ranging from -6.8+/-4.3% at 1 m s(-1) to -15.3+/-4.7% at 3.5 m s(-1). The consistent patterns of strain changes with running slope are evidence that strain pattern is modulated to meet the changes in demand for net mechanical work. The relatively poor relationship between strain and running speed may reflect the fact that changes in running speed during level running are not associated with a change in demand for net mechanical work.

Generally, muscle strain was less affected by speed than by slope. Shortening strains were not significantly correlated with running speed. Only FT lengthening strain changed significantly with speed, ranging from– 6.8±4.3% at 1 m s–1 to –15.3±4.7% at 3.5 m s–1. The consistent patterns of strain changes with running slope are evidence that strain pattern is modulated to meet the changes in demand for net mechanical work. The relatively poor relationship between strain and running speed may reflect the fact that changes in running speed during level running are not associated with a change in demand for net mechanical work. Taken together, the speed and slope results suggest that the demand for mechanical work is an important determinant of muscle length patterns in running and walking."
349,The kinematic consequences of locomotion on sloped arboreal substrates in a generalized (Rattus norvegicus) and a specialized (Sciurus vulgaris) rodent.,"Small mammals must negotiate terrains that consist of numerous substrates that vary in diameter, surface structure, rigidity and orientation. Most studies on mammals have focused on the effects of substrate diameter during horizontal locomotion, especially in small- to medium-sized primates and marsupials. Locomotion across sloped arboreal substrates, however, is poorly understood. Here, in order to determine which locomotor parameters a terrestrial mammal, the rat, and a tree-dwelling mammal, the European red squirrel, modify in response to differences in substrate orientation, three-dimensional kinematics were examined using biplanar videoradiography as the animals moved on 30 and 60 deg inclined branches. Our results revealed that to maintain stability and friction as well as balance during inclined branch locomotion, these species utilize comparable locomotor adjustments despite significant differences in travel speed and gait. Rats and European red squirrels increased limb flexion and retraction in order to bring the center of mass as close as possible to the substrate surface and to achieve maximum propulsion. Additionally, forelimbs were placed more laterally and underneath the branch whereas the hindlimbs were placed approximately on the top of the branch. These locomotor adjustments, which have also been observed in primates and marsupials, are independent of speed, morphological adaptations and limb proportions and thus might be strategies used by early mammals. Our results also suggest that mammals that lack, or have reduced, grasping abilities try to maintain the locomotor mode used during horizontal branch locomotion on inclined branches for as long as possible.",10.1242/jeb.051086,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21753049/,The kinematic consequences of locomotion on sloped arboreal substrates in a generalized (Rattus norvegicus) and a specialized (Sciurus vulgaris) rodent,"SUMMARY Small mammals must negotiate terrains that consist of numerous substrates that vary in diameter, surface structure, rigidity and orientation.

352,Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in oxygen minimum layer fishes: the role of alcohol dehydrogenase.,"Zones of minimum oxygen form at intermediate depth in all the world's oceans as a result of global circulation patterns that keep the water at oceanic mid-depths out of contact with the atmosphere for hundreds of years. In areas where primary production is very high, the microbial oxidation of sinking organic matter results in very low oxygen concentrations at mid-depths. Such is the case with the Arabian Sea, with O(2) concentrations reaching zero at 200 m and remaining very low (<0.1 ml O(2)l(-1)) for hundreds of meters below this depth, and in the California borderland, where oxygen levels reach 0.2 ml O(2)l(-1) at 700 m with severely hypoxic (<1.0 ml O(2)l(-1)) waters at depths 300 m above and below that. Despite the very low oxygen, mesopelagic fishes (primarily lanternfishes: Mytophidae) inhabiting the Arabian Sea and California borderland perform a daily vertical migration into the low-oxygen layer, spending daylight hours in the oxygen minimum zone and migrating upward into normoxic waters at night. To find out how fishes were able to survive their daily sojourns into the minimum zone, we tested the activity of four enzymes, one (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) that served as a proxy for anaerobic glycolysis with a conventional lactate endpoint, a second (citrate synthase, CS) that is indicative of aerobic metabolism, a third (malate dehydrogenase) that functions in the Krebs' cycle and as a bridge linking mitochondrion and cytosol, and a fourth (alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH) that catalyzes the final reaction in a pathway where pyruvate is reduced to ethanol.

353,Development of the sympatho-vagal balance in the cardiovascular system in zebrafish (Danio rerio) characterized by power spectrum and classical signal analysis.,"The development of sympatho-vagal control of cardiac activity was analyzed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae from 2 to 15 days post fertilization (d.p.f.) by pharmacological studies as well as by assessing short term heart rate variability. Changes in heart rate in response to cholinergic and adrenergic receptor stimulation or inhibition were investigated using in situ preparations and digital video-microscopic techniques. The data revealed that the heart responded to adrenergic stimulation starting at 4 d.p.f. and to cholinergic stimulation starting at 5 d.p.f. Atropine application resulted in an increase in heart rate beyond 12 d.p.f., while the inhibitory effect of cholinergic stimulation ceased at this time of development.

Arterial responses were evaluated as the change in dorsal aortic blood pressure (P(da)) before and after pre-branchial occlusion.

355,Sperm release strategies in marine broadcast spawners: the costs of releasing sperm quickly.,"When under competition for fertilisations, males are thought to increase their reproductive success by releasing as many sperm as possible into the reproductive arena and in many species, this prediction holds. For marine invertebrates, which utilise the ancestral strategy of broadcast spawning eggs and sperm, however, it appears that males tend to release their sperm more slowly than females release their eggs. Marine invertebrate eggs typically have a relatively slow permanent block to polyspermy (whereby eggs become impermeable to further sperm attachment), and for several minutes after fertilisation, sperm can continue to attach to a fertilised egg. We hypothesised that releasing sperm slowly minimises the 'wastage' of sperm on already fertilised eggs. We simulated different sperm release rates in a flume using the broadcast spawning polychaete, Galeolaria caespitosa. Sperm release rates strongly affected overall fertilisation success: higher release rates resulted in lower fertilisation rates. Laboratory studies confirmed that the 'permanent' block to polyspermy in G. caespitosa took less than a minute to form but this lag was sufficient to result in some sperm wastage. Thus upstream, fertilised eggs that have not formed a permanent block to polyspermy can remove sperm from the pool that would otherwise fertilise downstream sibling eggs. We suggest that while electrical blocks to polyspermy evolved in response to excess sperm, permanent blocks to polyspermy could have evolved in response to sperm limitation (insufficient sperm).",10.1242/jeb.008417,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17951412/,Sperm release strategies in marine broadcast spawners: the costs of releasing sperm quickly,"SUMMARY When under competition for fertilisations, males are thought to increase their reproductive success by releasing as many sperm as possible into the reproductive arena and in many species, this prediction holds.

We suggest that while electrical blocks to polyspermy evolved in response to excess sperm, permanent blocks to polyspermy could have evolved in response to sperm limitation (insufficient sperm).",True,"When under competition for fertilisations, males are thought to increase their reproductive success by releasing as many sperm as possible into the reproductive arena and in many species, this prediction holds. For marine invertebrates, which utilise the ancestral strategy of broadcast spawning eggs and sperm, however, it appears that males tend to release their sperm more slowly than females release their eggs. Marine invertebrate eggs typically have a relatively slow permanent block to polyspermy (whereby eggs become impermeable to further sperm attachment), and for several minutes after fertilisation, sperm can continue to attach to a fertilised egg. We hypothesised that releasing sperm slowly minimises the `wastage' of sperm on already fertilised eggs. We simulated different sperm release rates in a flume using the broadcast spawning polychaete, Galeolaria caespitosa. Sperm release rates strongly affected overall fertilisation success: higher release rates resulted in lower fertilisation rates. Laboratory studies confirmed that the `permanent' block to polyspermy in G. caespitosa took less than a minute to form but this lag was sufficient to result in some sperm wastage. Thus upstream, fertilised eggs that have not formed a permanent block to polyspermy can remove sperm from the pool that would otherwise fertilise downstream sibling eggs.

356,Body temperature stability achieved by the large body mass of sea turtles.,"To investigate the thermal characteristics of large reptiles living in water, temperature data were continuously recorded from 16 free-ranging loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, during internesting periods using data loggers. Core body temperatures were 0.7-1.7°C higher than ambient water temperatures and were kept relatively constant. Unsteady numerical simulations using a spherical thermodynamic model provided mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and the body temperature responses to fluctuating water temperature can be simply explained by a large body mass with a constant thermal diffusivity and a heat production rate rather than physiological thermoregulation. By contrast, body temperatures increased 2.6-5.1°C in 107-152 min during their emergences to nest on land. The estimated heat production rates on land were 7.4-10.5 times the calculated values in the sea. The theoretical prediction that temperature difference between body and water temperatures would increase according to the body size was confirmed by empirical data recorded from several species of sea turtles. Comparing previously reported data, the internesting intervals of leatherback, green and loggerhead turtles were shorter when the body temperatures were higher. Sea turtles seem to benefit from a passive thermoregulatory strategy, which depends primarily on the physical attributes of their large body masses.

357,Muscular and non-muscular contributions to maximum power cycling in children and adults: implications for developmental motor control.,"During submaximal cycling, children demonstrate a different distribution between muscular and non-muscular (gravitational and motion-dependent) forces when compared with adults. This is partly due to anthropometric differences. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that during maximum power cycling, children would construct the task (in terms of the distribution between muscular and non-muscular pedal power) similarly to adults. Eleven children (aged 8-9 years) and 13 adults (aged 20-40 years) performed a maximal isokinetic cycling task over 3 s at 115 r.p.m. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in normalized maximum, minimum and average positive non-muscular pedal power between children and adults (Wilks' lambda=0.755, F(3,20)=2.17, P=0.124). Thus, maximum cycling is a developmental ;self-scaling' task and age-related differences in muscular power production are not confounded by differences in anthropometry. This information is useful to researchers who wish to differentiate between muscular and non-muscular power when studying developmental motor control. In addition to the similarities in the distribution between muscular and non-muscular pedal power, we found age-related differences in the relative joint power contributions to total pedal power. In children, a significantly smaller proportion of total pedal power was generated at the ankle joint (6.1+/-5.4% for children and 12.6+/-3.2% for adults), whilst relatively more power was generated at the knee and hip joints.

358,Generalization and discrimination tasks yield concordant measures of perceived distance between odours and their binary mixtures in larval Drosophila.,"Similarity between odours is notoriously difficult to measure. Widely used behavioural approaches in insect olfaction research are cross-adaptation, masking, as well as associative tasks based on olfactory learning and the subsequent testing for how specific the established memory is. A concern with such memory-based approaches is that the learning process required to establish an odour memory may alter the way the odour is processed, such that measures of perception taken at the test are distorted. The present study was therefore designed to see whether behavioural judgements of perceptual distance are different for two different memory-based tasks, namely generalization and discrimination. We used odour-reward learning in larval Drosophila as a study case. In order to challenge the larvae's olfactory system, we chose to work with binary mixtures and their elements (1-octanol, n-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, benzaldehyde and hexyl acetate). We determined the perceptual distance between each mixture and its elements, first in a generalization task, and then in a discrimination task. It turns out that scores of perceptual distance are correlated between both tasks. A re-analysis of published studies looking at element-to-element perceptual distances in larval reward learning and in adult punishment learning confirms this result.

359,CHHBP: a newly identified receptor of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone.,"Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) is a neurohormone found only in arthropods that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hemolymph glucose levels, molting and stress responses.

362,The regulation and importance of glucose uptake in the isolated Atlantic cod heart: rate-limiting steps and effects of hypoxia.,"This study investigated the regulation of glucose uptake in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) hearts. Isolated hearts were perfused with or without glucose in the medium, under either normoxic or severely hypoxic conditions. Working at basal levels, hearts did not require extracellular glucose to maintain power under aerobic conditions. However, cardiac performance was significantly reduced without exogenous glucose under oxygen-limiting conditions. The addition of the glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B caused hypoxic hearts to fail early, and hearts perfused with a glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), increased glucose uptake 3-fold under hypoxia. The uptake of 2-DG was only partially inhibited when cytochalasin B was added to the medium. Isolated ventricle strips were also incubated in the presence of 2-DG and the extracellular marker mannitol. Glucose uptake (glucose transport plus intracellular phosphorylation) was assessed by measuring the initial rate of 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate (2-DG-6-P) accumulation. At 1 mmol l(-1) 2-DG, the rate of 2-DG uptake remained linear for 60 min, and 2-DG-6-P, but not free 2-DG, accumulation was increased. The fact that intracellular 2-DG did not increase indicates that glucose transport is the rate-limiting step for glucose utilization in non-stimulated cardiac tissue. Replacement of Na(+) by choline in the incubation medium did not affect 2-DG uptake, providing evidence that Na(+)-coupled glucose transport is absent in cod cardiac tissue. Similar to cytochalasin B, glucose uptake was also inhibited by phloridzin, suggesting that facilitated, carrier-mediated glucose transport occurs in cod hearts. Under the conditions employed in these experiments, it is clear that (1) activation of glucose transport is required to support hypoxic performance, (2) the rate-limiting step for glucose utilization is glucose transport rather than glucose phosphorylation, (3) 2-DG uptake accurately reflects glucose transport activity and (4) glucose uptake in cod hearts does not involve an Na(+)-dependent mechanism.",10.1242/jeb.00965,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15107441/,The regulation and importance of glucose uptake in the isolated Atlantic cod heart: rate-limiting steps and effects of hypoxia,"SUMMARY This study investigated the regulation of glucose uptake in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) hearts.

363,"Jumping in a wingless stick insect, Timema chumash (Phasmatodea, Timematodea, Timematidae).","The stick insect Timema chumash belongs to a sub-order of the phasmids that is thought to have diverged early from other stick insects, and which is restricted to the southwest of North America. It jumps by rapidly extending the tibiae of both its hind legs simultaneously from an initially fully flexed position, unlike any other stick insect that has been described. The hind legs are 1.5 times longer than the front and middle legs, but still represent only half the length of its body, and the femoro-tibial joints show few specialisations for jumping. In its best jumps, the wingless body is accelerated in 12 ms to a take-off velocity of 0.9 m s(-1) and experiences an acceleration of 75 m s(-2), the equivalent of 8 g. This performance requires an energy expenditure of 19 microJ, generates a power output of 1.6 mW and exerts a force of 3.6 mN. The jump propels the body forward a distance of 80 mm from a mean take-off angle of 39 degrees . Heights of 20 mm were also achieved. Elevation of the jump was controlled by the initial position of the hind legs; when the hind tibiae and femora projected above the dorsal outline of the body the jump was forwards, when parallel with the long axis of the body the jump was backwards and could result in somersaulting.

364,Acquisition and expression of memories of distance and direction in navigating wood ants.,"Wood ants, like other central place foragers, rely on route memories to guide them to and from a reliable food source. They use visual memories of the surrounding scene and probably compass information to control their direction. Do they also remember the length of their route and do they link memories of direction and distance? To answer these questions, we trained wood ant (Formica rufa) foragers in a channel to perform either a single short foraging route or two foraging routes in opposite directions. By shifting the starting position of the route within the channel, but keeping the direction and distance fixed, we tried to ensure that the ants would rely upon vector memories rather than visual memories to decide when to stop. The homeward memories that the ants formed were revealed by placing fed or unfed ants directly into a channel and assessing the direction and distance that they walked without prior performance of the food-ward leg of the journey. This procedure prevented the distance and direction walked being affected by a home vector derived from path integration. Ants that were unfed walked in the feeder direction. Fed ants walked in the opposite direction for a distance related to the separation between start and feeder. Vector memories of a return route can thus be primed by the ants' feeding state and expressed even when the ants have not performed the food-ward route. Tests on ants that have acquired two routes indicate that memories of the direction and distance of the return routes are linked, suggesting that they may be encoded by a common neural population within the ant brain.

365,"Hydrodynamic fin function of brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis.","Although the pulsed jet is often considered the foundation of a squid's locomotive system, the lateral fins also probably play an important role in swimming, potentially providing thrust, lift and dynamic stability as needed. Fin morphology and movement vary greatly among squid species, but the locomotive role of the fins is not well understood. To begin to elucidate the locomotive role of the fins in squids, fin hydrodynamics were studied in the brief squid Lolliguncula brevis, a species that exhibits a wide range of fin movements depending on swimming speed. Individual squid were trained to swim in both the arms-first and tail-first orientations against currents in a water tunnel seeded with light-reflective particles. Particle-laden water around the fins was illuminated with lasers and videotaped so that flow dynamics around the fins could be analyzed using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Time-averaged forces generated by the fin were quantified from vorticity fields of the fin wake. During the low swimming speeds considered in this study [<2.5 dorsal mantle lengths (DML) per second], L. brevis exhibited four unique fin wake patterns, each with distinctive vortical structures: (1) fin mode I, in which one vortex is shed with each downstroke, generally occurring at low speeds; (2) fin mode II, an undulatory mode in which a continuous linked chain of vortices is produced; (3) fin mode III, in which one vortex is shed with each downstroke and upstroke, and; (4) fin mode IV, in which a discontinuous chain of linked double vortex structures is produced. All modes were detected during tail-first swimming but only fin modes II and III were observed during arms-first swimming. The fins produced horizontal and vertical forces of varying degrees depending on stroke phase, swimming speed, and swimming orientation. During tail-first swimming, the fins functioned primarily as stabilizers at low speeds before shifting to propulsors as speed increased, all while generating net lift. During arms-first swimming, the fins primarily provided lift with thrust production playing a reduced role. These results demonstrate the lateral fins are an integral component of the complex locomotive system of L. brevis, producing lift and thrust forces through different locomotive modes.",10.1242/jeb.039057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20511514/,"Hydrodynamic fin function of brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis","SUMMARY Although the pulsed jet is often considered the foundation of a squid's locomotive system, the lateral fins also probably play an important role in swimming, potentially providing thrust, lift and dynamic stability as needed.

369,Inter-leg coordination in the control of walking speed in Drosophila.,"Legged locomotion is the most common behavior of terrestrial animals and it is assumed to have become highly optimized during evolution. Quadrupeds, for instance, use distinct gaits that are optimal with regard to metabolic cost and have characteristic kinematic features and patterns of inter-leg coordination. In insects, the situation is not as clear. In general, insects are able to alter inter-leg coordination systematically with locomotion speed, producing a continuum of movement patterns. This notion, however, is based on the study of several insect species, which differ greatly in size and mass. Each of these species tends to walk at a rather narrow range of speeds. We have addressed these issues by examining four strains of Drosophila, which are similar in size and mass, but tend to walk at different speed ranges. Our data suggest that Drosophila controls its walking speed almost exclusively via step frequency. At high walking speeds, we invariably found tripod coordination patterns, the quality of which increased with speed as indicated by a simple measure of tripod coordination strength (TCS). At low speeds, we also observed tetrapod coordination and wave gait-like walking patterns. These findings not only suggest a systematic speed dependence of inter-leg movement patterns but also imply that inter-leg coordination is flexible. This was further supported by amputation experiments in which we examined walking behavior in animals after the removal of a hindleg. These animals show immediate adaptations in body posture, leg kinematics and inter-leg coordination, thereby maintaining their ability to walk.",10.1242/jeb.078139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23038731/,Inter-leg coordination in the control of walking speed in Drosophila,"SUMMARY Legged locomotion is the most common behavior of terrestrial animals and it is assumed to have become highly optimized during evolution.

These animals show immediate adaptations in body posture, leg kinematics and inter-leg coordination, thereby maintaining their ability to walk.",True,"Legged locomotion is the most common behavior of terrestrial animals and it is assumed to have become highly optimized during evolution. Quadrupeds, for instance, use distinct gaits that are optimal with regard to metabolic cost and have characteristic kinematic features and patterns of inter-leg coordination. In insects, the situation is not as clear. In general, insects are able to alter inter-leg coordination systematically with locomotion speed, producing a continuum of movement patterns. This notion, however, is based on the study of several insect species, which differ greatly in size and mass. Each of these species tends to walk at a rather narrow range of speeds. We have addressed these issues by examining four strains of Drosophila, which are similar in size and mass, but tend to walk at different speed ranges. Our data suggest that Drosophila controls its walking speed almost exclusively via step frequency. At high walking speeds, we invariably found tripod coordination patterns, the quality of which increased with speed as indicated by a simple measure of tripod coordination strength (TCS). At low speeds, we also observed tetrapod coordination and wave gait-like walking patterns. These findings not only suggest a systematic speed dependence of inter-leg movement patterns but also imply that inter-leg coordination is flexible. This was further supported by amputation experiments in which we examined walking behavior in animals after the removal of a hindleg. These animals show immediate adaptations in body posture, leg kinematics and inter-leg coordination, thereby maintaining their ability to walk."
370,"Changes in composition of spider orb web sticky droplets with starvation and web removal, and synthesis of sticky droplet compounds.","The sticky spiral of araneoid spider orb webs consists of silk fibers coated with adhesive droplets. The droplets contain a variety of low-molecular-mass compounds (LMM). Within a species, a fairly consistent ratio of LMM is often observed, but substantial variability can exist. To gain insight into factors influencing LMM composition, spiders of three araneid species were starved and LMM from their webs were analyzed for changes in composition. To determine if these changes were consistent with the spider's ability to synthesize the different organic LMM, synthetic capacities were estimated following the feeding of radiolabeled metabolites. Some changes in droplet composition were broadly consistent with differing synthetic capacities: molar percentages of less readily synthesized compounds (e.g. choline, isethionate, N-acetyltaurine) typically declined with starvation, at least during a portion of the imposed fast, while more readily synthesized compounds (e.g. GABamide, glycine) tended to increase. Most striking was the apparent partial substitution of N-acetylputrescine by the more readily synthesized GABamide in fasting Argiope trifasciata. However, departures from expected compositional shifts demonstrated that synthetic capacity alone does not adequately predict sticky droplet compositional shifts with starvation. Moreover, feeding controls exhibited some changes in composition similar to starving spiders. As the webs of both feeding and starving spiders were removed for chemical analysis and could not be recycled, the loss of LMM contained in these webs likely contributed to similarities between treatments. In addition, feeding spiders molted, oviposited and/or built heavier webs. The added metabolic demands of these activities may have contributed to changes in composition similar to those resulting from starvation.",10.1242/jeb.02147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16574806,"Changes in composition of spider orb web sticky droplets with starvation and web removal, and synthesis of sticky droplet compounds","SUMMARY The sticky spiral of araneoid spider orb webs consists of silk fibers coated with adhesive droplets.

371,Fruit bats (Pteropodidae) fuel their metabolism rapidly and directly with exogenous sugars.,"Previous studies reported that fed bats and birds mostly use recently acquired exogenous nutrients as fuel for flight, rather than endogenous fuels, such as lipids or glycogen. However, this pattern of fuel use may be a simple size-related phenomenon because, to date, only small birds and bats have been studied with respect to the origin of metabolized fuel, and because small animals carry relatively small energy reserves, considering their high mass-specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that approximately 150 g Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus Pteropodidae), which are more than an order of magnitude heavier than previously studied bats, also catabolize dietary sugars directly and exclusively to fuel both rest and flight metabolism. We based our expectation on the observation that these animals rapidly transport ingested dietary sugars, which are absorbed via passive paracellular pathways in the intestine, to organs of high energy demand. We used the stable carbon isotope ratio in exhaled CO(2) (delta(13)C(breath)) to assess the origin of metabolized substrates in 16 Egyptian fruit bats that were maintained on a diet of C3 plants before experiments. First, we predicted that in resting bats delta(13)C(breath) remains constant when bats ingest C3 sucrose, but increases and converges on the dietary isotopic signature when C4 sucrose and C4 glucose are ingested. Second, if flying fruit bats use exogenous nutrients exclusively to fuel flight, we predicted that delta(13)C(breath) of flying bats would converge on the isotopic signature of the C4 sucrose they were fed. Both resting and flying Egyptian fruit bats, indeed, directly fuelled their metabolism with freshly ingested exogenous substrates. The rate at which the fruit bats oxidized dietary sugars was as fast as in 10 g nectar-feeding bats and 5 g hummingbirds.

Using wild-caught animals, we measured oxygen consumption rate and physiological markers of hormonal stress response, energy availability and anaerobic respiration in blood plasma across five ecologically relevant temperatures (24, 28, 32, 35 and 38°C; 3 h exposure). Corticosterone, insulin and glucose concentrations all increased with temperature, but with different thermal response curves, suggesting that high temperatures differently affect energy-regulation pathways. Additionally, oxygen consumption rate increased without plateau and lactate concentration did not increase with temperature, challenging the recent hypothesis that oxygen limitation sets upper thermal tolerance limits. Finally, animals had similar physiological thermal responses to high-temperature exposure regardless of genetic background, suggesting that local adaptation has not resulted in fixed differences between ecotypes.

374,Activity-dependent gene expression in honey bee mushroom bodies in response to orientation flight.,"The natural history of adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) provides an opportunity to study the molecular basis of learning in an ecological context. Foragers must learn to navigate between the hive and floral locations that may be up to miles away.

We found that Egr, an insect homolog of Egr-1, is rapidly and transiently upregulated in the mushroom bodies in response to orientation.

376,Unconventional mechanisms control cyclic respiratory gas release in flying Drosophila.,"The high power output of flight muscles places special demands on the respiratory gas exchange system in insects. In small insects, respiration relies on diffusion, and for elevated locomotor performance such as flight, instantaneous gas exchange rates typically co-vary with the animal's metabolic activity. By contrast, under certain conditions, instantaneous release rate of carbon dioxide from the fruit fly Drosophila flying in a virtual-reality flight arena may oscillate distinctly at low frequency (0.37+/-0.055 Hz), even though flight muscle mechanical power output requires constant metabolic activity. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that this uncoupling between respiratory and metabolic rate is not driven by conventional types of convective flow reinforcement such as abdominal pumping, but might result from two unusual mechanisms for tracheal breathing. Simplified analytical modeling of diffusive tracheal gas exchange suggests that cyclic release patterns in the insect occur as a consequence of the stochastically synchronized control of spiracle opening area by the four large thoracic spiracles. Alternatively, in-flight motion analysis of the abdomen and proboscis using infra-red video imaging suggests utilization of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) for tracheal convection.

An overall assessment of the different mechanisms involved in force production during take-off has never been explored. Focusing on the first downstroke, we have addressed this problem from a force balance perspective in butterflies taking off from the ground. In order to determine whether the sole aerodynamic wing force could explain the observed motion of the insect, we have firstly compared a simple analytical model of the wing force with the acceleration of the insect's center of mass estimated from video tracking of the wing and body motions. Secondly, wing kinematics were also used for numerical simulations of the aerodynamic flow field. Similar wing aerodynamic forces were obtained by the two methods. However, neither are sufficient, nor is the inclusion of the ground effect, to predict faithfully the body acceleration. We have to resort to the leg forces to obtain a model that best fits the data. We show that the median and hind legs display an active extension responsible for the initiation of the upward motion of the insect's body, occurring before the onset of the wing downstroke. We estimate that legs generate, at various times, an upward force that can be much larger than all other forces applied to the insect's body. The relative timing of leg and wing forces explains the large variability of trajectories observed during the maneuvers.

379,Dynamic properties of a locomotory muscle of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta during strain cycling and simulated natural crawling.,"Caterpillars are soft-bodied terrestrial climbers that perform a wide variety of complex movements with several hundred muscles and a relatively small number of neurons. Control of movements is therefore expected to place unusual demands on the mechanical properties of the muscles. The muscles develop force slowly (1-6 s to peak) yet over a strain range extending from under 60% to more than 160% of resting length, with a length-tension relationship resembling that of supercontracting or cross-striated muscle. In passive and active sinusoidal strain cycling, muscles displayed viscoelastic qualities, with very low and stretch-velocity dependent resilience; there was a positive linear relationship between stretch velocity and the fraction of work dissipation attributable to passive muscle properties (20-80%). In linear stretches of unstimulated muscles at velocities bracketing those encountered in natural crawling, the rise in tension showed a distinct transition to a lower rate of increase, with transition tension dependent upon stretch velocity; peak force was exponentially related to stretch velocity. When stretching ceased, force decayed exponentially, with slower decay associated with lower stretch velocities; the decay time constant was exponentially related to stretch velocity. From the kinematics of caterpillars crawling horizontally we determined that the ventral interior lateral muscle (VIL) of the third abdominal segment (A3) is at or near resting length for most of the crawl cycle, with a fairly linear shortening by 25-30% and re-lengthening occupying about 45% of cycle duration. Synchronized kinematic and EMG recordings showed that during horizontal crawling A3 VIL is stimulated as the muscle shortens from about 95% to 75% of its resting length. We subjected in vitro VIL preparations to strain cycling and stimulus phase and duration similar to that of natural crawling. The resulting work loops were figure-eight shaped, with the muscle performing work during the shortest 45-65% of the strain cycle but dissipating work during the rest of the cycle. The muscle remained in the ascending limb of its length-tension relationship throughout the crawl cycle. Peak force occurred at the end of re-lengthening, nearly a full second after stimulation ceased, underscoring the importance of understanding passive muscle properties to explain caterpillar locomotion. Whether A3 VIL functions as an actuator at all during simulated natural strain cycling is highly sensitive to stimulus timing but far less so to stimulus duration.

380,Water deprivation increases maternal corticosterone levels and enhances offspring growth in the snake Vipera aspis.,"Circulating glucocorticoid (GC) levels may increase as a result of reproductive effort or in response to unpredictable events. However, GC secretion can vary with the availability of vital trophic resources such as energy. While water represents another critical resource, the impact of water deprivation on GC secretion during reproduction has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we examined the effects of water deprivation on plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations of female aspic vipers (Vipera aspis), and determined the impacts of water deprivation on offspring traits. We exposed both pregnant and non-reproductive females to a 20-day water deprivation and compared their pre- and post-deprivation CORT levels with those of control females. At the end of the treatment, only water-deprived pregnant females showed a significant increase in CORT levels. In pregnant females, changes in baseline CORT level were correlated with changes in female hydration state. Changes in baseline CORT levels were also negatively influenced by maternal reproductive effort in pregnant control females, while such a relationship was not apparent in pregnant water-deprived females. Finally, we found that offspring from water-deprived females had higher growth rates than offspring from control females. Offspring growth was also positively correlated with changes in both maternal osmolality and baseline CORT levels. Together, our results suggest that dehydration increases maternal CORT levels, which may subsequently influence offspring development.

382,Social synchronization of circadian locomotor activity rhythm in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.,"Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across a wide range of taxa. To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light-dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b(0)) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods.",10.1242/jeb.057554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22031738/,Social synchronization of circadian locomotor activity rhythm in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,"SUMMARY Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across a wide range of taxa.

383,Visual stimuli induced by self-motion and object-motion modify odour-guided flight of male moths (Manduca sexta L.).,"Animals rely on multimodal sensory integration for proper orientation within their environment. For example, odour-guided behaviours often require appropriate integration of concurrent visual cues. To gain a further understanding of mechanisms underlying sensory integration in odour-guided behaviour, our study examined the effects of visual stimuli induced by self-motion and object-motion on odour-guided flight in male M. sexta. By placing stationary objects (pillars) on either side of a female pheromone plume, moths produced self-induced visual motion during odour-guided flight. These flights showed a reduction in both ground and flight speeds and inter-turn interval when compared with flight tracks without stationary objects. Presentation of an approaching 20 cm disc, to simulate object-motion, resulted in interrupted odour-guided flight and changes in flight direction away from the pheromone source. Modifications of odour-guided flight behaviour in the presence of stationary objects suggest that visual information, in conjunction with olfactory cues, can be used to control the rate of counter-turning. We suggest that the behavioural responses to visual stimuli induced by object-motion indicate the presence of a neural circuit that relays visual information to initiate escape responses. These behavioural responses also suggest the presence of a sensory conflict requiring a trade-off between olfactory and visually driven behaviours.

Contrary to our prediction, we found that larger grasshoppers had critical PO2s eight times lower than juveniles due in part to their threefold lower mass-specific metabolic rates and their ability to quadruple convective gas exchange. Adults more than doubled abdominal pumping frequency and increased tidal volume by 25% as PO2 decreased fourfold, whereas the youngest juveniles showed no such responses. This study indicates that juveniles may be more susceptible to hypoxia in natural situations, such as exposure to high altitude or restricted burrows. Also, larger size is not necessarily correlated with a smaller safety margin for oxygen delivery in insects."
386,Prolonged exposure to stressors suppresses exploratory behavior in zebrafish larvae.,"Environmental stressors induce rapid physiological and behavioral shifts in vertebrate animals. However, the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for stress-induced changes in behavior are complex and not well understood. Similar to mammalian vertebrates, zebrafish adults display a preference for dark environments that is associated with predator avoidance, enhanced by stressors, and broadly used in assays for anxiety-like behavior. Although the larvae of zebrafish are a prominent model organism for understanding neural circuits, fewer studies have examined the effects of stressors on their behavior. This study examines the effects of noxious chemical and electric shock stressors on locomotion and light preference in zebrafish larvae. We found that both stressors elicited similar changes in behavior. Acute exposure induced increased swimming activity, while prolonged exposure depressed activity. Neither stressor produced a consistent shift in light/dark preference, but prolonged exposure to these stressors resulted in a pronounced decrease in exploration of different visual environments. We also examined the effects of exposure to a noxious chemical cue using whole-brain calcium imaging, and identified neural correlates in the area postrema, an area of the hindbrain containing noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. Pharmaceutical blockade experiments showed that ɑ-adrenergic receptors contribute to the behavioral response to an acute stressor but are not necessary for the response to a prolonged stressor.

387,Deconstructing honeybee vitellogenin: novel 40 kDa fragment assigned to its N terminus.,"Vitellogenin, an egg-yolk protein precursor common to oviparous animals, is found abundantly in honeybee workers - a caste of helpers that do not usually lay eggs. Instead, honeybee vitellogenin (180 kDa) participates in processes other than reproduction: it influences hormone signaling, food-related behavior, immunity, stress resistance and longevity. The molecular basis of these functions is largely unknown. Here, we establish and compare the molecular properties of vitellogenin from honeybee hemolymph (blood) and abdominal fat body, two compartments that are linked to vitellogenin functions. Our results reveal a novel 40 kDa vitellogenin fragment in abdominal fat body tissue, the main site for vitellogenin synthesis and storage. Using MALDI-TOF combined with MS/MS mass-spectroscopy, we assign the 40 kDa fragment to the N terminus of vitellogenin, whereas a previously observed 150 kDa fragment corresponded to the remainder of the protein. We show that both protein units are N glycosylated and phosphorylated. Focusing on the novel 40 kDa fragment, we present a homology model based on the structure of lamprey lipovitellin that includes a conserved β-barrel-like shape, with a lipophilic cavity in the interior and two insect-specific loops that have not been described before.

391,Decreased precision contributes to the hypoxic thermoregulatory response in lizards.,"The decrease in body temperature (T(b)) observed in most vertebrate classes in response to hypoxia has been attributed to a regulated decrease in set-point, protecting organs against tissue death due to oxygen depletion.

In ectotherms, where thermoregulation is mainly behavioural, stressors that influence the propensity to move and respond to temperature gradients are expected to have an impact on thermoregulatory control. Using low oxygen as a potent stressor, we evaluated the variability and level of thermoregulation of inland bearded dragons. To examine the source of thermoregulatory variability, we studied their behaviour in an electronically controlled temperature-choice shuttle box, a constant temperature dual-choice shuttle box, and a linear thermal gradient. A significant increase in the size of the T(b) range was observed at the lowest oxygen concentration (4% O(2)), reflecting a decrease in thermoregulatory precision in the temperature-choice shuttle box. This was also accompanied by a drop of approximately 2-4 degrees C in T(b), the drop being greatest in situations where T(b) must be actively defended.

The DPOAE tuning curve derived from the response matrix resembles that obtained previously by electrophysiology, and is V-shaped and tuned to frequencies between 25 and 45 kHz with low Q10dB values of 1.21±0.26.

The DPOAE tuning curve derived from the response matrix resembles that obtained previously by electrophysiology, and is V-shaped and tuned to frequencies between 25 and 45 kHz with low Q10dB values of 1.21±0.26. In addition, while using a comparable stimulation regime, mechanical distortion in the displacement of the moth's tympanal membrane at the stigma was recorded with a laser Doppler vibrometer. The corresponding mechanical vibration audiograms were compared with DPOAE audiograms. Both types of audiograms have comparable shape, but most of the mechanical response fields are shifted towards lower frequencies. We showed for the first time in moths that DPOAE have a pronounced analogy in the vibration of the tympanic membrane where they may originate. Our work supports previous studies that point to the stigma (and the internally associated transduction machinery) as an important place of sound amplification in the moth ear, but also suggests a complex mechanical role for the rest of the transparent zone."
394,The role of the cerebral ganglia in the venom-induced behavioral manipulation of cockroaches stung by the parasitoid jewel wasp.,"The jewel wasp stings cockroaches and injects venom into their cerebral ganglia, namely the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) and supraesophageal ganglion (SupOG). The venom induces a long-term hypokinetic state, during which the stung cockroach shows little or no spontaneous walking. It was shown that venom injection to the SOG reduces neuronal activity, thereby suggesting a similar effect of venom injection in the SupOG. Paradoxically, SupOG-ablated cockroaches show increased spontaneous walking in comparison with control. Yet most of the venom in the SupOG of cockroaches is primarily concentrated in and around the central complex (CX). Thus the venom could chiefly decrease activity in the CX to contribute to the hypokinetic state. Our first aim was to resolve this discrepancy by using a combination of behavioral and neuropharmacological tools. Our results show that the CX is necessary for the initiation of spontaneous walking, and that focal injection of procaine to the CX is sufficient to induce the decrease in spontaneous walking. Furthermore, it was shown that artificial venom injection to the SOG decreases walking. Hence our second aim was to test the interactions between the SupOG and SOG in the venom-induced behavioral manipulation. We show that, in the absence of the inhibitory control of the SupOG on walking initiation, injection of venom in the SOG alone by the wasp is sufficient to induce the hypokinetic state. To summarize, we show that venom injection to either the SOG or the CX of the SupOG is, by itself, sufficient to decrease walking.",10.1242/jeb.116491,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25687435/,The role of the cerebral ganglia in the venom-induced behavioral manipulation of cockroaches stung by the parasitoid jewel wasp,"ABSTRACT The jewel wasp stings cockroaches and injects venom into their cerebral ganglia, namely the subesophageal ganglion (SOG) and supraesophageal ganglion (SupOG).

395,Movements of vastly different performance have similar underlying muscle physiology.,"Many animals use elastic recoil mechanisms to power extreme movements, achieving levels of performance that would not be possible using muscle power alone.

396,Could thermal sensitivity of mitochondria determine species distribution in a changing climate?,"For many aquatic species, the upper thermal limit (Tmax) and the heart failure temperature (THF) are only a few degrees away from the species' current environmental temperatures. While the mechanisms mediating temperature-induced heart failure (HF) remain unresolved, energy flow and/or oxygen supply disruptions to cardiac mitochondria may be impacted by heat stress. Recent work using a New Zealand wrasse (Notolabrus celidotus) found that ATP synthesis capacity of cardiac mitochondria collapses prior to T(HF). However, whether this effect is limited to one species from one thermal habitat remains unknown. The present study confirmed that cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to heat stress-induced HF in two additional wrasses that occupy cold temperate (Notolabrus fucicola) and tropical (Thalassoma lunare) habitats. With exposure to heat stress, T. lunare had the least scope to maintain heart function with increasing temperature. Heat-exposed fish of all species showed elevated plasma succinate, and the heart mitochondria from the cold temperate N. fucicola showed decreased phosphorylation efficiencies (depressed respiratory control ratio, RCR), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) flux and electron transport system (ETS) flux. In situ assays conducted across a range of temperatures using naive tissues showed depressed complex II (CII) and CCO capacity, limited ETS reserve capacities and lowered efficiencies of pyruvate uptake in T. lunare and N. celidotus. Notably, alterations of mitochondrial function were detectable at saturating oxygen levels, indicating that cardiac mitochondrial insufficiency can occur prior to HF without oxygen limitation.

397,Function of a large biarticular hip and knee extensor during walking and running in guinea fowl (Numida meleagris).,"Physiological and anatomical evidence suggests that in birds the iliotibialis lateralis pars postacetabularis (ILPO) is functionally important for running. Incorporating regional information, we estimated the mean sarcomere strain trajectory and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude of the ILPO during level and incline walking and running. Using these data and data in the literature of muscle energy use, we examined three hypotheses: (1) active lengthening will occur on the ascending limb of the length-tension curve to avoid potential damage caused by stretch on the descending limb; (2) the active strain cycle will shift to favor active shortening when the birds run uphill and shortening will occur on the plateau and shallow ascending limb of the length-tension curve; and (3) measures of EMG intensity will correlate with energy use when the mechanical function of the muscle is similar. Supporting the first hypothesis, we found that the mean sarcomere lengths at the end of active lengthening during level locomotion were smaller than the predicted length at the start of the plateau of the length-tension curve. Supporting the second hypothesis, the magnitude of active lengthening decreased with increasing slope, whereas active shortening increased. In evaluating the relationship between EMG amplitude and energy use (hypothesis 3), we found that although increases in EMG intensity with speed, slope and loading were positively correlated with muscle energy use, the quantitative relationships between these variables differed greatly under different conditions. The relative changes in EMG intensity and energy use by the muscle probably varied because of changes in the mechanical function of the muscle that altered the ratio of muscle energy use to active muscle volume. Considering the overall function of the cycle of active lengthening and shortening of the fascicles of the ILPO, we conclude that the function of active lengthening is unlikely to be energy conservation and may instead be related to promoting stability at the knee. The work required to lengthen the ILPO during stance is provided by co-contracting knee flexors.

398,Respiratory patterns and oxygen consumption in singing zebra finches.,"Song production in birds is driven by temporally complex respiratory patterns. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), song consists of repetitions of a stereotyped sequence of distinct syllables (motif). Syllables correspond to distinct expiratory pulses, which alternate with short deep inspirations. We investigated the effect of the song motor pattern on respiration using a newly developed mask system to measure oxygen consumption while simultaneously monitoring subsyringeal air sac pressure. The metabolic cost of song is closely related to song duration (mean=85.7 microl O(2) g(-1) x min(-1) over pre-song levels) and confirms earlier estimates for this species. When motif duration is controlled for, there is only small interindividual variability in oxygen consumption per motif. The oxygen measurements were also used to evaluate various methods of estimating and reporting the metabolic cost. Up to 20s before song, respiratory activity and oxygen consumption increased. Shortly before and during the introductory notes of the song bout, respiration and oxygen consumption decreased markedly. In some individuals, significant hyperventilation occurred during song, causing almost complete apnea after the song. In three different birds, we measured tracheal airflow and air sac pressure during song. Birds with higher airflow during song relative to flow during quiet respiration had a more pronounced decrease in respiratory activity after the song bout. These results suggest that gas exchange continues in the lung during the song bout and that long expiratory pressure pulses of the song motif can lead to hyperventilation but that no oxygen debt resulted from song.

400,Selected regulation of gastrointestinal acid-base secretion and tissue metabolism for the diamondback water snake and Burmese python.,"Snakes exhibit an apparent dichotomy in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) performance with feeding and fasting; frequently feeding species modestly regulate intestinal function whereas infrequently feeding species rapidly upregulate and downregulate intestinal function with the start and completion of each meal, respectively. The downregulatory response with fasting for infrequently feeding snakes is hypothesized to be a selective attribute that reduces energy expenditure between meals. To ascertain the links between feeding habit, whole-animal metabolism, and GI function and metabolism, we measured preprandial and postprandial metabolic rates and gastric and intestinal acid-base secretion, epithelial conductance and oxygen consumption for the frequently feeding diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer) and the infrequently feeding Burmese python (Python molurus). Independent of body mass, Burmese pythons possess a significantly lower standard metabolic rate and respond to feeding with a much larger metabolic response compared with water snakes. While fasting, pythons cease gastric acid and intestinal base secretion, both of which are stimulated with feeding. In contrast, fasted water snakes secreted gastric acid and intestinal base at rates similar to those of digesting snakes. We observed no difference between fasted and fed individuals for either species in gastric or intestinal transepithelial potential and conductance, with the exception of a significantly greater gastric transepithelial potential for fed pythons at the start of titration. Water snakes experienced no significant change in gastric or intestinal metabolism with feeding. Fed pythons, in contrast, experienced a near-doubling of gastric metabolism and a tripling of intestinal metabolic rate. For fasted individuals, the metabolic rate of the stomach and small intestine was significantly lower for pythons than for water snakes. The fasting downregulation of digestive function for pythons is manifested in a depressed gastric and intestinal metabolism, which selectively serves to reduce basal metabolism and hence promote survival between infrequent meals.

We observed no difference between fasted and fed individuals for either species in gastric or intestinal transepithelial potential and conductance, with the exception of a significantly greater gastric transepithelial potential for fed pythons at the start of titration. Water snakes experienced no significant change in gastric or intestinal metabolism with feeding. Fed pythons, in contrast, experienced a near-doubling of gastric metabolism and a tripling of intestinal metabolic rate. For fasted individuals, the metabolic rate of the stomach and small intestine was significantly lower for pythons than for water snakes. The fasting downregulation of digestive function for pythons is manifested in a depressed gastric and intestinal metabolism, which selectively serves to reduce basal metabolism and hence promote survival between infrequent meals. By maintaining elevated GI performance between meals, fasted water snakes incur the additional cost of tissue activity, which is expressed in a higher standard metabolic rate."
401,Effects of series elastic compliance on muscle force summation and the rate of force rise.,"Compliant tendons permit mechanically unfavourable fascicle dynamics during fixed-end contractions. The purpose of this study was to reduce the effective compliance of tendon and investigate how small reductions in active shortening affect twitch kinetics and contractile performance in response to a second stimulus. The series elastic element (SEE) of the human triceps surae (N=15) was effectively stiffened by applying a 55 ms rotation to the ankle, through a range of 5 deg, at the onset of twitch and doublet [interstimulus interval (ISI) of 80 ms] stimulation. Ultrasonography was employed to quantify lateral gastrocnemius and soleus fascicle lengths. Rotation increased twitch torque (40-75%), rate of torque development (RTD; 124-154%) and torque-time integral (TTI; 70-110%) relative to constant-length contractions at the initial and final joint positions, yet caused only modest reductions in shortening amplitude and velocity. The torque contribution of the second pulse increased when stimulation was preceded by rotation, a finding unable to be explained on the basis of fascicle length or SEE stiffness during contraction post-rotation. A further increase in torque contribution was not demonstrated, nor was an increase in doublet TTI, when the second pulse was delivered during rotation and shortly after the initial pulse (ISI of 10 ms). The depressant effect of active shortening on subsequent torque generation suggests that compliant tendons, by affording large length changes, may limit torque summation. Our findings indicate that changes in tendon compliance shown to occur in response to resistance training or unloading are likely sufficient to considerably alter contractile performance, particularly maximal RTD.",10.1242/jeb.142604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510960/,Effects of series elastic compliance on muscle force summation and the rate of force rise,"ABSTRACT Compliant tendons permit mechanically unfavourable fascicle dynamics during fixed-end contractions.

402,Characterization of amphioxus nebulin and its similarity to human nebulin.,"Identification of a large molecule in muscle is important but difficult to approach by protein chemistry. In this study we isolated nebulin cDNA from the striated muscle of amphioxus, and characterized the C-terminal regions of nebulins from other chordates. Although the sequence homology with that of human is only 26%, the C-terminal region of amphioxus nebulin has similar structural motifs of 35 amino acid nebulin repeats and an SH3 domain.

403,"Size, shape, and orientation of macro-sized substrate protrusions affect the toe and foot adhesion of geckos.","Geckos are excellent climbers using compliant, hierarchically-arranged adhesive toes to negotiate diverse terrains varying in roughness at multiple size scales. Here, we complement advancements at smaller size scales with measurements at the macro-scale. We studied the attachment of a single toe and whole foot of geckos on macro-scale rough substrates by pulling them along, across, and off smooth rods and spheres mimicking different geometric protrusions of substrates. When we pulled a single toe along rods, the force increased with the rod diameter. Whereas, the attachment force of dragging toes across rods increased from about 60% on small diameter rods relative to a flat surface to approximately 100% on larger diameter rods, but showed no further increase as rod diameter doubled. Toe force also increased as the pulling changed from along-rod loading to across-rod loading. When pulled off from spheres, toe force increased continuously with sphere diameter as observed in along-rod pulling. For feet with separated toes, attachment on spheres was stronger than that on rods with the same diameter. Attachment force of a foot decreased as rod and sphere size increased, but remained sufficient to support the body weight of geckos. These results provide a bridge to the macro-scale roughness seen in nature by revealing the importance of the dimension, shape, and orientation of macro-sized substrate features for compliant toe and foot function of geckos.

We measured brain phospholipid composition during development in red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), an altricial species that breeds in aquatic habitats.

Finally, we assessed selective uptake of yolk by comparing the yolk fatty acid composition of freshly laid eggs and day-old hatchlings. Relative to other altricial species, blackbirds achieved high DHA in brain phospholipids (20% of phospholipid fatty acids in day-old hatchlings). This was not a result of selective uptake from the yolk, but rather a consequence of a high proportion of DHA in the yolk (2.5% of total lipids) at laying. Our dietary study confirmed that nestling brains are sensitive to fatty acid supply. Red-winged blackbirds may be able to advance cognitive development relative to other altricial species owing to their aquatic maternal diet.

405,Properties of predictive gain modulation in a dragonfly visual neuron.,"Dragonflies pursue and capture tiny prey and conspecifics with extremely high success rates. These moving targets represent a small visual signal on the retina and successful chases require accurate detection and amplification by downstream neuronal circuits. This amplification has been observed in a population of neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs), through a mechanism we term predictive gain modulation. As targets drift through the neuron's receptive field, spike frequency builds slowly over time. This increased likelihood of spiking or gain is modulated across the receptive field, enhancing sensitivity just ahead of the target's path, with suppression of activity in the remaining surround. Whilst some properties of this mechanism have been described, it is not yet known which stimulus parameters modulate the amount of response gain. Previous work suggested that the strength of gain enhancement was predominantly determined by the duration of the target's prior path. Here, we show that predictive gain modulation is more than a slow build-up of responses over time. Rather, the strength of gain is dependent on the velocity of a prior stimulus combined with the current stimulus attributes (e.g. angular size). We also describe response variability as a major challenge of target-detecting neurons and propose that the role of predictive gain modulation is to drive neurons towards response saturation, thus minimising neuronal variability despite noisy visual input signals.",10.1242/jeb.207316,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31395677/,Properties of predictive gain modulation in a dragonfly visual neuron,"ABSTRACT Dragonflies pursue and capture tiny prey and conspecifics with extremely high success rates.

406,Effects of shell morphology on mechanics of zebra and quagga mussel locomotion.,"Although zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) initially colonized shallow habitats within the North American Great Lakes, quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) are becoming dominant in both shallow- and deep-water habitats. Shell morphology differs among zebra, shallow quagga and deep quagga mussels but functional consequences of such differences are unknown. We examined effects of shell morphology on locomotion for the three morphotypes on hard (typical of shallow habitats) and soft (characteristic of deep habitats) sedimentary substrates. We quantified morphology using the polar moment of inertia, a parameter used in calculating kinetic energy that describes shell area distribution and resistance to rotation. We quantified mussel locomotion by determining the ratio of rotational (K(rot)) to translational kinetic energy (K(trans)). On hard substrate, K(rot):K(trans) of deep quagga mussels was fourfold greater than for the other morphotypes, indicating greater energy expenditure in rotation relative to translation. On soft substrate, K(rot):K(trans) of deep quagga mussels was approximately one-third of that on hard substrate, indicating lower energy expenditure in rotation on soft substrate. Overall, our study demonstrates that shell morphology correlates with differences in locomotion (i.e. K(rot):K(trans)) among morphotypes.

In modeling the latter situation, we applied the heat exchanger efficiencies from the steady-state model to predict the distribution of temperature and heat fluxes in bigeye tuna during their extensive daily vertical excursions. The simulations yielded a close match to the data recorded in free-swimming fish and strongly point to the importance of the heat-producing and heat-conserving properties of the white muscle. The best correspondence between model output and observed data was obtained when the countercurrent heat exchangers in the blood flow pathways to the red and white muscle retained 99% and 96% (respectively) of the heat produced in these tissues. Our model confirms that the ability of bigeye tuna to maintain elevated muscle temperatures during their extensive daily vertical movements depends on their ability to rapidly modulate heating and cooling rates. This study shows that the differential cooling and heating rates could be fully accounted for by a mechanism where blood flow to the swimming muscles is either exclusively through the heat exchangers or completely shunted around them, depending on the ambient temperature relative to the body temperature.

408,Escaping compound eye ancestry: the evolution of single-chamber eyes in holometabolous larvae.,"Stemmata, the eyes of holometabolous insect larvae, have gained little attention, even though they exhibit remarkably different optical solutions, ranging from compound eyes with upright images, to sophisticated single-chamber eyes with inverted images. Such optical differences raise the question of how major transitions may have occurred. Stemmata evolved from compound eye ancestry, and optical differences are apparent even in some of the simplest systems that share strong cellular homology with adult ommatidia. The transition to sophisticated single-chamber eyes occurred many times independently, and in at least two different ways: through the fusion of many ommatidia [as in the sawfly (Hymenoptera)], and through the expansion of single ommatidia [as in tiger beetles (Coleoptera), antlions (Neuroptera) and dobsonflies (Megaloptera)]. Although ommatidia-like units frequently have multiple photoreceptor layers (tiers), sophisticated image-forming stemmata tend to only have one photoreceptor tier, presumably a consequence of the lens only being able to efficiently focus light on to one photoreceptor layer. An interesting exception is found in some diving beetles [Dytiscidae (Coleoptera)], in which two retinas receive sharp images from a bifocal lens.

An interesting exception is found in some diving beetles [Dytiscidae (Coleoptera)], in which two retinas receive sharp images from a bifocal lens. Taken together, stemmata represent a great model system to study an impressive set of optical solutions that evolved from a relatively simple ancestral organization."
409,Comparison of rotator cuff muscle architecture between humans and other selected vertebrate species.,"In this study, we compare rotator cuff muscle architecture of typically used animal models with that of humans and quantify the scaling relationships of these muscles across mammals. The four muscles that correspond to the human rotator cuff - supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor - of 10 commonly studied animals were excised and subjected to a series of comparative measurements. When body mass among animals was regressed against physiological cross-sectional area, muscle mass and normalized fiber length, the confidence intervals suggested geometric scaling but did not exclude other scaling relationships. Based on the architectural difference index (ADI), a combined measure of fiber length-to-moment arm ratio, fiber length-to-muscle length ratio and the fraction of the total rotator cuff physiological cross-sectional area contributed by each muscle, chimpanzees were found to be the most similar to humans (ADI=2.15), followed closely by capuchins (ADI=2.16). Interestingly, of the eight non-primates studied, smaller mammals such as mice, rats and dogs were more similar to humans in architectural parameters compared with larger mammals such as sheep, pigs or cows. The force production versus velocity trade-off (indicated by fiber length-to-moment arm ratio) and the excursion ability (indicated by fiber length-to-muscle length ratio) of humans were also most similar to those of primates, followed by the small mammals. Overall, primates provide the best architectural representation of human muscle architecture.

411,"Sound production in the longnose butterflyfishes (genus Forcipiger): cranial kinematics, muscle activity and honest signals.","Many teleost fishes produce sounds for social communication with mechanisms that do not involve swim bladder musculature. Such sounds may reflect physical attributes of the sound-production mechanism, be constrained by body size and therefore control signal reliability during agonistic behaviors. We examined kinematics of the cranium, median fins and caudal peduncle during sound production in two territorial chaetodontid butterflyfish sister species: forcepsfish (Forcipiger flavissimus) and longnose butterflyfish (F. longirostris). During intraspecific agonistic encounters, both species emit a single pulse sound that precedes rapid cranial rotation at velocities and accelerations that exceed those of prey strikes by many ram- and suction-feeding fishes. Electromyography showed that onsets of activity for anterior epaxialis, sternohyoideus, A1 and A2 adductor mandibulae muscles and sound emission are coincident but precede cranial elevation. Observations indicate that sound production is driven by epaxial muscle contraction whereas a ventral linkage between the head and pectoral girdle is maintained by simultaneous activity from the adductor mandibulae and sternohyoideus. Thus, the girdle, ribs and rostral swim bladder are pulled anteriorly before the head is released and rotated dorsally. Predictions of the hypothesis that acoustic signals are indicators of body size and kinematic performance were confirmed. Variation in forcepsfish sound duration and sound pressure level is explained partly by cranial elevation velocity and epaxial electromyogram duration. Body size, however, explains most variation in duration and sound pressure level. These observed associations indicate that forcepsfish sounds may be accurate indicators of size and condition that are related to resource holding potential during social encounters.",10.1242/jeb.062554,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22031748/,"Sound production in the longnose butterflyfishes (genus Forcipiger): cranial kinematics, muscle activity and honest signals","SUMMARY Many teleost fishes produce sounds for social communication with mechanisms that do not involve swim bladder musculature.

412,The accumulation of methylamine counteracting solutes in elasmobranchs with differing levels of urea: a comparison of marine and freshwater species.,"We compared levels of the major organic osmolytes in the muscle of elasmobranchs, including the methylamines trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and sarcosine as well as the beta-amino acids taurine and beta-alanine, and the activities of enzymes of methylamine synthesis (betaine and TMAO) in species with a wide range of urea contents. Four marine, a euryhaline in freshwater (Dasyatis sabina), and two freshwater species, one that accumulates urea (Himantura signifer) and one that does not (Potamotrygon motoro), were analyzed. Urea contents in muscle ranged from 229-352 micromol g-1 in marine species to 2.0 micromol g-1 in P. motoro. Marine elasmobranchs preferentially accumulate methylamines, possibly to counteract urea effects on macromolecules, whereas the freshwater species with lower urea levels accumulate the beta-amino acid taurine as the major non-urea osmolyte. A strong correlation (r2=0.84, P<0.001) with a slope of 0.40 was found between muscle urea content and the combined total methylamines plus total beta-amino acids, supporting the hypothesis that ;non-urea' osmolytes are specifically maintained at an approximately 2:1 ratio with urea in the muscle of elasmobranchs. All species examined had measurable synthetic capacity for betaine in the liver but only one species had detectable TMAO synthetic capacity. We propose a phylogenetic explanation for the distribution of TMAO synthesis in elasmobranchs and suggest that activation of liver betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, relative to choline dehydrogenase, coincides with betaine accumulation in elasmobranchs.

413,Biomechanical effects of augmented ankle power output during human walking.,"The plantarflexor muscles are critical for forward propulsion and leg swing initiation during the push-off phase of walking, serving to modulate step length and walking speed. However, reduced ankle power output is common in aging and gait pathology, and is considered a root biomechanical cause of compensatory increases in hip power generation and increased metabolic energy cost. There is a critical need for mechanistic insight into the precise influence of ankle power output on patterns of mechanical power generation at the individual joint and limb levels during walking. We also posit that rehabilitative approaches to improve locomotor patterns should consider more direct means to elicit favorable changes in ankle power output. Thus, here we used real-time inverse dynamics in a visual biofeedback paradigm to test young adults' ability to modulate ankle power output during preferred speed treadmill walking, and the effects thereof on gait kinematics and kinetics. Subjects successfully modulated peak ankle power in response to biofeedback targets designed to elicit up to ±20% of normal walking values. Increasing ankle power output alleviated mechanical power demands at the hip and increased trailing limb positive work, propulsive ground reaction forces and step lengths. Decreasing ankle power had the opposite effects. We conclude that ankle power generation systematically influences the workload placed on more proximal leg muscles, trailing leg mechanical output and step length. Our findings also provide a promising benchmark for the application of biofeedback to restore ankle power in individuals with deficits thereof due to aging and gait pathology.",10.1242/jeb.182113,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30266784,Biomechanical effects of augmented ankle power output during human walking,"ABSTRACT The plantarflexor muscles are critical for forward propulsion and leg swing initiation during the push-off phase of walking, serving to modulate step length and walking speed.

414,"The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, excretes urea mainly through the mouth instead of the kidney.","The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, is well adapted to aquatic environments, including brackish swamps and marshes. It is ureotelic, and occasionally submerges its head into puddles of water during emersion, presumably for buccopharyngeal respiration. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the buccophyaryngeal cavity constitutes an important excretory route for urea in P. sinensis. Results indicate that a major portion of urea was excreted through the mouth instead of the kidney during immersion. When restrained on land, P. sinensis occasionally submerged their head into water (20-100 min), during which urea excretion and oxygen extraction occurred simultaneously. These results indicate for the first time that buccopharyngeal villiform processes (BVP) and rhythmic pharyngeal movements were involved in urea excretion in P. sinensis. Urea excretion through the mouth was sensitive to phloretin inhibition, indicating the involvement of urea transporters (UTs). In addition, saliva samples collected from the buccopharyngeal surfaces of P. sinensis injected intraperitoneally with saline contained ~36 mmol N l(-1) urea, significantly higher than that (~2.4 mmol N l(-1)) in the plasma. After intraperitoneal injection with 20 μmol urea g(-1) turtle, the concentration of urea in the saliva collected from the BVP increased to an extraordinarily high level of ~614 μmol N ml(-1), but the urea concentration (~45 μmol N ml(-1)) in the plasma was much lower, indicating that the buccopharyngeal epithelium of P. sinensis was capable of active urea transport. Subsequently, we obtained from the buccopharyngeal epithelium of P. sinensis the full cDNA sequence of a putative UT, whose deduced amino acid sequence had ~70% similarity with human and mouse UT-A2. This UT was not expressed in the kidney, corroborating the proposition that the kidney had only a minor role in urea excretion in P. sinensis. As UT-A2 is known to be a facilitative urea transporter, it is logical to deduce that it was localized in the basolateral membrane of the buccopharyngeal epithelium, and that another type of primary or secondary active urea transporter yet to be identified was present in the apical membrane.

415,An overview of a Lagrangian method for analysis of animal wake dynamics.,"The fluid dynamic analysis of animal wakes is becoming increasingly popular in studies of animal swimming and flying, due in part to the development of quantitative flow visualization techniques such as digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV).

The assumption of quasi-steady flow leads to neglect of unsteady (time-dependent) wake vortex added-mass effects, which can contribute significantly to the instantaneous locomotive forces. In this paper we review a Lagrangian approach recently introduced to determine unsteady wake vortex structure by tracking the trajectories of individual fluid particles in the flow, rather than by analyzing the velocity/vorticity fields at fixed locations and single instants in time as in the Eulerian perspective. Once the momentum of the wake vortex and its added mass are determined, the corresponding unsteady locomotive forces can be quantified. Unlike previous studies that estimated the time-averaged forces over the stroke cycle, this approach enables study of how instantaneous locomotive forces evolve over time.

Cormorants are known to be less buoyant than most water birds but are still highly buoyant (rho= approximately 0.8 kg m(-3)) due to their adaptations for aerial flight. Nevertheless, cormorants are known to dive at a wide range of depths, including shallow dives where buoyancy is maximal. We analyzed the kinematics of underwater swimming of the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in a shallow pool to discover and evaluate the mechanisms countering buoyancy while swimming horizontally. The birds maintained a very uniform cyclic paddling pattern. Throughout this cycle, synchronized tilting of the body, controlled by the tail, resulted in only slight vertical drifts of the center of mass around the average swimming path. We suggest that this tilting behavior serves two purposes: (1) the elongated bodies and the long tails of cormorants, tilted at a negative angle of attack relative to the swimming direction, generate downward directed hydrodynamic lift to resist buoyancy and (2) during the propulsive phase, the motion of the feet has a significant vertical component, generating a vertical component of thrust downward, which further helps to offset buoyancy.

418,Physiological responses to self-induced burrowing and metabolic rate depression in the ocean quahog Arctica islandica.,"Arctica islandica is the longest-lived non-colonial animal found so far, and reaches individual ages of 150 years in the German Bight (GB) and more than 350 years around Iceland (IC).

We investigated burrowing patterns and shell water partial pressure of oxygen (P(O(2))) in experiments with live A. islandica. Furthermore, succinate accumulation and antioxidant defences were recorded in tissues of bivalves in the normoxic or metabolically downregulated state, as well as ROS formation in isolated gills exposed to normoxia, hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation. IC bivalves burrowed more frequently and deeper in winter than in summer under in situ conditions, and both IC and GB bivalves remained burrowed for between 1 and 6 days in laboratory experiments. Shell water P(O(2)) was <5 kPa when bivalves were maintained in fully oxygenated seawater, and ventilation increased before animals entered the state of metabolic depression. Succinate did not accumulate upon spontaneous shell closure, although shell water P(O(2)) was 0 kPa for over 24 h. A ROS burst was absent in isolated gills during hypoxia/reoxygenation, and antioxidant enzyme activities were not enhanced in metabolically depressed clams compared with normally respiring clams.

420,Differential muscular myosin heavy chain expression of the pectoral and pelvic girdles during early growth in the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) chick.,"Continuous growth, associated with a steady parental food supply, is a general pattern in offspring development. So that young chicks can acquire their locomotor independence, this period is usually marked by a fast maturation of muscles, during which different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms are expressed. However, parental food provisioning may fluctuate seasonally, and offspring therefore face a challenge to ensure the necessary maturation of their tissues when energy is limited. To address this trade-off we investigated muscle maturation in both the pectoral and pelvic girdles of king penguin chicks. This species has an exceptionally long rearing period (1 year), which is prolonged when parental food provisioning is drastically reduced during the sub-Antarctic winter. Approximately 1 month post hatching, chicks acquire a functional pedestrian locomotion, which uses pelvic muscles, whereas swimming, which uses the pectoral muscles, only occurs 1 year later. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the MyHC content of the leg muscles reaches a mature state before those of the pectoral muscles. We found that leg muscle MyHC composition changed with the progressive acquisition of pedestrian locomotion, whereas pectoral muscle fibres reached their mature MyHC profile as early as hatching. Contrary to our predictions, the acquisition of the adult profile in pectoral muscles could be related to an early maturation of the contractile muscular proteins, presumably associated with early thermoregulatory capacities of chicks, necessary for survival in their cold environment.

The direction of the open access relative to the array was either maintained stable or it was changed throughout training. The relative position of the pipes in the array was maintained stable in both training conditions. Chicks reoriented according to configural geometry as long as the open access pointed in the same direction during training but failed when the positions of the openings was changed throughout training. When the correct pipe was characterized by a distinctive featural cue, chicks learnt to locate the reward irrespective of the stability of the direction to openings, indicating that place-navigation was dissociated from non-spatial learning.

The relative position of the pipes in the array was maintained stable in both training conditions. Chicks reoriented according to configural geometry as long as the open access pointed in the same direction during training but failed when the positions of the openings was changed throughout training. When the correct pipe was characterized by a distinctive featural cue, chicks learnt to locate the reward irrespective of the stability of the direction to openings, indicating that place-navigation was dissociated from non-spatial learning.

The hypothesis that in so doing they rely on allocentric (map-like) representations has received wide consensus. However, theoretical models suggest that egocentric representations may represent efficient strategies for visuo-spatial navigation. Here, we provide, for the first time, evidence that a view-based strategy is effectively used by animals to reorient themselves in an array of landmarks. Domestic chicks were trained to locate a food-reward in a rectangular array of either four indistinguishable or distinctive pipes. In the key experimental series, the pipes had four openings, only one of which allowed the chicks to access the reward. The direction of the open access relative to the array was either maintained stable or it was changed throughout training.

424,Why do models of insect respiratory patterns fail?,"Insects exchange respiratory gases using an astonishing diversity of patterns. Of these, discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) have received the most study, but there are many other patterns exhibited intraspecifically and interspecifically.

The first is that the framework will have to be simultaneously general and highly detailed. It should describe, in a universal way, the physical and chemical processes that any insect uses to exchange gases through the respiratory system (i.e. tracheal tubes and spiracles) while simultaneously containing enough morphological, physiological and neural detail that it captures the specifics of patterns exhibited by any species or individual.

425,Activation of the newly discovered cyclostome renin-angiotensin system in the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis.,"This study describes the first investigations of the physiological signals involved in activating the newly discovered cyclostome renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its role in the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis. Experimental manipulation showed that volume depletion (removal of 40% blood volume) rapidly activated the RAS of lampreys acclimated to water at 576 mOsm kg(-1) (21 p.p.t.), significantly increasing plasma angiotensin concentrations after 30 min and 60 min. In agreement with these results, a rapid change in environmental salinity (758 mOsm kg(-1) to freshwater (FW) and FW to 605 mOsm kg(-1)), resulted in a rapid decrease and increase in plasma [angiotensin], respectively. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of FW-acclimated river lampreys with 1% body mass by volume of nominally isosmotic saline (120 mmol l(-1) NaCl; 233 mOsm kg(-1)) resulted in a significant decrease in the plasma angiotensin concentration within 15 min. In contrast, i.p. injection of hyperosmotic saline (4 mol l(-1) NaCl) at 1% body mass by volume, which significantly increased plasma osmolality, had no significant effect on plasma [angiotensin], suggesting that volume/pressure receptors and osmoreceptors interact in regulating the lamprey RAS. These results indicate an important role for volume/pressor receptors, as in teleosts, but with an additional osmoreceptor mechanism, such that circulatory [angiotensin] is determined by interaction of volume/pressure and osmoreceptors and their relative sensitivities. The volume/pressure sensitivity is in keeping with the recent evidence of a vasoconstrictor action of homologous lamprey angiotensin and provides evidence that the fundamental role of the RAS in maintaining volume and pressure is an ancient function conserved over 500 million years of vertebrate evolution.",10.1242/jeb.01362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15634842/,Activation of the newly discovered cyclostome renin–angiotensin system in the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis,"SUMMARY This study describes the first investigations of the physiological signals involved in activating the newly discovered cyclostome renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and its role in the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis.

429,Limits to sustained energy intake. XIV. Heritability of reproductive performance in mice.,"Limits to sustained energy intake (SusEI) are important because they constrain many aspects of animal performance. Individual variability in SusEI may be imposed by genetic factors that are inherited from parents to offspring. Here, we investigated heritability of reproductive performance in MF1 mice. Food intake, milk energy output (MEO) and litter mass were measured in mothers (F0) and daughters (F1) that were raising litters of 10 pups. Cross-fostering was designed so that half of each litter consisted of biological offspring and the rest came from one unrelated female (i.e. fostered pups). Food intake increased linearly during early lactation and reached a plateau during late lactation (day 9-13, called the asymptotic food intake, FIAS, equivalent to SusEI). Parent-offspring regression showed that FIAS, MEO and litter mass were all positively and significantly related between mothers and their biological daughters, but no significant relationships were found between the same traits for mothers and fostered daughters. FIAS at peak lactation was significantly correlated to adult food intake and body mass when the mice were 6 months old and not lactating. In conclusion, a large part of the variation in FIAS could be explained by genetic variation or maternal effects in pregnancy whereas non-genetic maternal effects in lactation were negligible.

430,"Three calpains and ecdysone receptor in the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis: sequences, expression and effects of elevated ecdysteroid induced by eyestalk ablation.","Crustacean muscle has four calpain-like proteinase activities (CDP I, IIa, IIb and III) that are involved in molt-induced claw muscle atrophy, as they degrade myofibrillar proteins in vitro and in situ. Using PCR cloning techniques, three full-length calpain cDNAs (Gl-CalpB, Gl-CalpM and Gl-CalpT) were isolated from limb regenerates of the tropical land crab Gecarcinus lateralis. All three had highly conserved catalytic (dII) and C2-like (dIII) domains. Gl-CalpB was classified as a typical, or EF-hand, calpain, as the deduced amino acid sequence had a calmodulin-like domain IV in the C-terminus and was most similar to Drosophila calpains A and B. Based on its estimated mass (approximately 88.9 kDa) and cross-immunoreactivity with a polyclonal antibody raised against Dm-CalpA, Gl-CalpB may encode CDP IIb, which is a homodimer of a 95-kDa subunit. It was expressed in all tissues examined, including skeletal muscle, heart, integument, gill, digestive gland, hindgut, nerve ganglia, gonads and Y-organ (molting gland). Both Gl-CalpM and Gl-CalpT were classified as atypical, or non-EF-hand, calpains, as they lacked a domain IV sequence. Gl-CalpM was a homolog of Ha-CalpM from lobster, based on similarities in deduced amino acid sequence, estimated mass (approximately 65.2 kDa) and structural organization (both were truncated at the C-terminal end of dIII). It was expressed at varying levels in most tissues, except Y-organ. Gl-CalpT (approximately 74.6 kDa) was similar to TRA-3 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; domain IV was replaced by a unique ;T domain' sequence. It was expressed in most tissues, except eyestalk ganglia and Y-organ. The effects of elevated ecdysteroid, induced by eyestalk ablation, on calpain and ecdysone receptor (Gl-EcR) mRNA levels in skeletal muscles were quantified by real-time PCR.

Premolt reduction in claw muscle mass and concomitant remodeling of the sarcomere probably result from post-transcriptional regulation of calpains.",True,"Crustacean muscle has four calpain-like proteinase activities (CDP I, IIa, IIb and III) that are involved in molt-induced claw muscle atrophy, as they degrade myofibrillar proteins in vitro and in situ. Using PCR cloning techniques, three full-length calpain cDNAs (Gl-CalpB, Gl-CalpM and Gl-CalpT) were isolated from limb regenerates of the tropical land crab Gecarcinus lateralis. All three had highly conserved catalytic (dII) and C2-like (dIII) domains. Gl-CalpB was classified as a typical, or EF-hand, calpain, as the deduced amino acid sequence had a calmodulin-like domain IV in the C-terminus and was most similar to Drosophila calpains A and B. Based on its estimated mass (∼88.9 kDa) and cross-immunoreactivity with a polyclonal antibody raised against Dm-CalpA, Gl-CalpB may encode CDP IIb, which is a homodimer of a 95-kDa subunit. It was expressed in all tissues examined, including skeletal muscle, heart, integument, gill, digestive gland, hindgut, nerve ganglia, gonads and Y-organ (molting gland). Both Gl-CalpM and Gl-CalpT were classified as atypical, or non-EF-hand, calpains, as they lacked a domain IV sequence. Gl-CalpM was a homolog of Ha-CalpM from lobster, based on similarities in deduced amino acid sequence, estimated mass (∼65.2 kDa) and structural organization (both were truncated at the C-terminal end of dIII). It was expressed at varying levels in most tissues, except Y-organ. Gl-CalpT (∼74.6 kDa) was similar to TRA-3 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; domain IV was replaced by a unique `T domain' sequence. It was expressed in most tissues, except eyestalk ganglia and Y-organ. The effects of elevated ecdysteroid, induced by eyestalk ablation, on calpain and ecdysone receptor (Gl-EcR) mRNA levels in skeletal muscles were quantified by real-time PCR. At 1 day after eyestalk ablation, Gl-EcR and Gl-CalpT mRNA levels increased 15- and 19.3-fold, respectively, in claw muscle but not in thoracic muscle. At 3 days after eyestalk ablation, Gl-EcR and Gl-CalpT mRNA levels in claw muscle had decreased to 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold higher than those in intact controls, respectively, suggesting a feedback inhibition by ecdysteroid. There was no significant effect of eyestalk ablation on Gl-CalpB and Gl-CalpM mRNA levels. Gl-CalpT and Gl-EcR mRNA levels were significantly correlated in both claw and thoracic muscles from intact and eyestalk-ablated animals. The data suggest that Gl-CalpT is involved in initiation of claw muscle atrophy by ecdysteroids. Premolt reduction in claw muscle mass and concomitant remodeling of the sarcomere probably result from post-transcriptional regulation of calpains."
431,Anthropogenic noise and the bioacoustics of terrestrial invertebrates.,"Anthropogenic noise is an important issue of environmental concern owing to its wide-ranging effects on the physiology, behavior and ecology of animals.

433,Waiting time before release increases the motivation to home in homing pigeons (Columba livia).,"When performing homing experiments with individual releases, pigeons have to wait in a transport box for a certain amount of time before being released and hence perceive the departure of companions.

By releasing pigeons from a familiar site, we investigated the effects of the time spent at the release site on homing performance, recording pigeons' flights with GPS loggers. Our results show that, despite individual peculiarities of flight patterns, the waiting time at release site had a positive effect on homing speed and time, and reduced the time spent circling around the release point. However, the overall path efficiency as derived from GPS tracking was not influenced.

434,Superficial neuromasts facilitate non-visual feeding by larval striped bass (Morone saxatilis).,"To investigate whether mechanoreception is used in non-visual feeding in larval striped bass (Morone saxatilis), the ontogeny of superficial neuromasts along the lateral line was described using the vital stain FM1-43FX and fluorescent microscopy. The number of neuromasts visible along one flank increased from 11 at first feeding [5 to 7 days post-hatch (dph)] to >150 by the juvenile stage (27 dph). A neomycin dose response (0, 1, 2 and 5 mmol l(-1)) was evaluated for neuromast ablation of bass aged 10, 13, 17 and 20 dph. Using these same age groups, the ability of bass to catch Artemia salina prey in both dark and light tank-based feeding trials was compared between larvae with neuromasts ablated using neomycin (5 mmol l(-1)) and controls.

The primary organ driving circulation is the dorsal vessel, which consists of an abdominal heart and a thoracic aorta. Here, we present qualitative and quantitative data characterizing the heart of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Visual observation showed that the heart of resting mosquitoes contracts at a rate of 1.37 Hz (82 beats per minute) and switches contraction direction, with 72% of contractions occurring in the anterograde direction (toward the head) and 28% of contractions occurring in the retrograde direction (toward the tip of the abdomen). The heart is tethered to the midline of the abdominal tergum by six complete and three incomplete pairs of alary muscles, and propels hemolymph at an average velocity of 8 mm s(-1) by sequentially contracting muscle fibers oriented in a helical twist with respect to the lumen of the vessel. Hemolymph enters the heart through six pairs of incurrent abdominal ostia and one pair of ostia located at the thoraco-abdominal junction that receive hemolymph from the abdominal hemocoel and thoracic venous channels, respectively. The vessel expels hemolymph through distal excurrent openings located at the anterior end of the aorta and the posterior end of the heart.

436,Angular momentum in human walking.,"Angular momentum is a conserved physical quantity for isolated systems where no external moments act about a body's center of mass (CM). However, in the case of legged locomotion, where the body interacts with the environment (ground reaction forces), there is no a priori reason for this relationship to hold. A key hypothesis in this paper is that angular momentum is highly regulated throughout the walking cycle about all three spatial directions [|Lt| approximately 0], and therefore horizontal ground reaction forces and the center of pressure trajectory can be explained predominantly through an analysis that assumes zero net moment about the body's CM. Using a 16-segment human model and gait data for 10 study participants, we found that calculated zero-moment forces closely match experimental values (Rx2=0.91; Ry2=0.90). Additionally, the centroidal moment pivot (point where a line parallel to the ground reaction force, passing through the CM, intersects the ground) never leaves the ground support base, highlighting how closely the body regulates angular momentum. Principal component analysis was used to examine segmental contributions to whole-body angular momentum. We found that whole-body angular momentum is small, despite substantial segmental momenta, indicating large segment-to-segment cancellations ( approximately 95% medio-lateral, approximately 70% anterior-posterior and approximately 80% vertical). Specifically, we show that adjacent leg-segment momenta are balanced in the medio-lateral direction (left foot momentum cancels right foot momentum, etc.). Further, pelvis and abdomen momenta are balanced by leg, chest and head momenta in the anterior-posterior direction, and leg momentum is balanced by upper-body momentum in the vertical direction.

439,Variation in the heat shock response and its implication for predicting the effect of global climate change on species' biogeographical distribution ranges and metabolic costs.,"The preferential synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to thermal stress [the heat shock response (HSR)] has been shown to vary in species that occupy different thermal environments. A survey of case studies of aquatic (mostly marine) organisms occupying stable thermal environments at all latitudes, from polar to tropical, shows that they do not in general respond to heat stress with an inducible HSR. Organisms that occupy highly variable thermal environments (variations up to >20 degrees C), like the intertidal zone, induce the HSR frequently and within the range of body temperatures they normally experience, suggesting that the response is part of their biochemical strategy to occupy this thermal niche. The highest temperatures at which these organisms can synthesize Hsps are only a few degrees Celsius higher than the highest body temperatures they experience. Thus, they live close to their thermal limits and any further increase in temperature is probably going to push them beyond those limits. In comparison, organisms occupying moderately variable thermal environments (<10 degrees C), like the subtidal zone, activate the HSR at temperatures above those they normally experience in their habitats. They have a wider temperature range above their body temperature range over which they can synthesize Hsps.

By means of an experimental model, we demonstrate that the siphon principle is able to explain how blood was able to adequately perfuse the sauropod brain. The return venous circulation may have been protected from complete collapse by a structure akin to the vertebral venous plexus. We derive an equation relating neck height and mean arterial pressure, which indicates that with a mean arterial pressure similar to that of the giraffe, the maximum safe vertical distance between heart and head would have been about 12 m.

443,Negative correlation between milk production and brown adipose tissue gene expression in lactating mice.,"It has been proposed that the performance of lactating animals is limited by the capacity of the female to dissipate body heat - the heat dissipation limit (HDL) theory.

To test this prediction, we measured the expression of genes linked to thermogenesis in BAT of lactating laboratory mice. The applicability of BAT gene expression to reflect thermogenic activity of BAT was confirmed by a positive relationship between expression levels of several BAT genes (summarised by the first principal component following principal component analysis) and daily energy expenditure in virgin mice. Milk production at peak lactation was strongly and negatively associated with the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Downregulation of these genes during lactation was correlated with low levels of circulating leptin and high levels of circulating prolactin. Our results are consistent with the HDL theory.

444,The human iliotibial band is specialized for elastic energy storage compared with the chimp fascia lata.,"This study examines whether the human iliotibial band (ITB) is specialized for elastic energy storage relative to the chimpanzee fascia lata (FL). To quantify the energy storage potential of these structures, we created computer models of human and chimpanzee lower limbs based on detailed anatomical dissections. We characterized the geometry and force-length properties of the FL, tensor fascia lata (TFL) and gluteus maximus (GMax) in four chimpanzee cadavers based on measurements of muscle architecture and moment arms about the hip and knee. We used the chimp model to estimate the forces and corresponding strains in the chimp FL during bipedal walking, and compared these data with analogous estimates from a model of the human ITB, accounting for differences in body mass and lower extremity posture. We estimate that the human ITB stores 15- to 20-times more elastic energy per unit body mass and stride than the chimp FL during bipedal walking. Because chimps walk with persistent hip flexion, the TFL and portions of GMax that insert on the FL undergo smaller excursions (origin to insertion) than muscles that insert on the human ITB. Also, because a smaller fraction of GMax inserts on the chimp FL than on the human ITB, and thus its mass-normalized physiological cross-sectional area is about three times less in chimps, the chimp FL probably transmits smaller muscle forces. These data provide new evidence that the human ITB is anatomically derived compared with the chimp FL and potentially contributes to locomotor economy during bipedal locomotion.

445,The sugar meal of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and how deterrent compounds interfere with it: a behavioural and neurophysiological study.,"In this study, we show that female African malaria mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae starved for 3-5 h start to engorge on sucrose at concentrations between 50 and 75 mmol l(-1). Half of the feeding response (ED50) is reached at 111 mmol l(-1) and the maximum response (0.4 mg) occurs at 250 mmol l(-1). Two receptor cells in a trichoid sensillum of the labellum, called the 'sucrose' and 'water' neurones, are activated by sucrose and water, respectively. The electrophysiological response of the sucrose receptor cell starts well below the level of sugar necessary to induce engorgement. The sugar receptor cell is most sensitive to small increments in sucrose concentration up to 10 mmol l(-1) with a response plateau from 25 mmol l(-1). Fructose has a mild phagostimulatory effect on A. gambiae, whereas no significant differences in meal sizes between water and glucose were found. However, when 146 mmol l(-1) fructose plus glucose are mixed, the same engorgement as on 146 mmol l(-1) sucrose is observed. Likewise, even though the sucrose receptor cell is not activated by either fructose or glucose alone, equimolar solutions of fructose plus glucose activate the neurone. We conclude that there is a behavioural and neurophysiological synergism between fructose and glucose, the two hexose sugars of sucrose. We show that some bitter-tasting products for humans have a deterrent effect on feeding in A. gambiae. When 1 mmol l(-1) quinidine, quinine or denatonium benzoate is added to 146 mmol l(-1) sucrose, feeding is almost totally inhibited. The effect of berberine is lower and no significant inhibition on engorgement occurs for caffeine. The deterrent effect depends on the concentration for both quinine and quinidine. Capillary feeding experiments show that contact chemosensilla on the mouthparts are sufficient for the detection of sucrose and bitter products.

When 1 mmol l−1 quinidine, quinine or denatonium benzoate is added to 146 mmol l−1 sucrose, feeding is almost totally inhibited. The effect of berberine is lower and no significant inhibition on engorgement occurs for caffeine. The deterrent effect depends on the concentration for both quinine and quinidine. Capillary feeding experiments show that contact chemosensilla on the mouthparts are sufficient for the detection of sucrose and bitter products. The feeding assay findings with deterrents correlate with the neurophysiological responses of the sucrose and water labellar neurones, which are both inhibited by the bitter compounds denatonium benzoate, quinine and berberine between 0.01 and 1 mmol l−1, but not by the same concentrations of caffeine. In conclusion, sucrose stimulates feeding and activates the labellar sucrose neurone, whereas feeding deterrents inhibit both the sucrose and water neurones. This study provides an initial understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in sugar feeding in A. gambiae and shows how some bitter products interfere with it."

447,Energetic cost of communication.,"Communication signals may be energetically expensive or inexpensive to produce, depending on the function of the signal and the competitive nature of the communication system. Males of sexually selected species may produce high-energy advertisement signals, both to enhance detectability and to signal their size and body condition.

448,Allometric scaling of flight energetics in orchid bees: evolution of flux capacities and flux rates.,"The evolution of metabolic pathways involved in energy production was studied in the flight muscles of 28 species of orchid bees. Previous work revealed that wingbeat frequencies and mass-specific metabolic rates decline in parallel by threefold as body mass increases interspecifically over a 20-fold range. We investigated the correlated evolution of metabolic rates during hovering flight and the flux capacities, i.e. V(max) values, of flight muscle enzymes involved in substrate catabolism, the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. V(max) at the hexokinase (HK) step scales allometrically with an exponent almost identical to those obtained for wingbeat frequency and mass-specific metabolic rate. Analysis of this relationship using phylogenetically independent contrasts supports the hypothesis of correlated evolution between HK activity and mass-specific metabolic rate. Although other enzymes scale allometrically with respect to body mass, e.g. trehalase, glycogen phosphorylase and citrate synthase, no other enzyme activities were correlated with metabolic rate after controlling for phylogenetic relatedness. Pathway flux rates were used with enzyme V(max) values to estimate fractional velocities (fraction of V(max) at which enzymes operate) for various reactions to gain insights into enzyme function and how this varies with body mass. Fractional velocity is highly conserved across species at the HK step, but varied at all other steps examined.

In nature, swallows (",10.1242/jeb.165373,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217628/,Conversion efficiency of α-linolenic acid to omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in aerial insectivore chicks,"ABSTRACT Food availability and quality are both critical for growing young animals. In nature, swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and other aerial insectivores feed on both aquatic insects, which are rich in omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), and terrestrial insects, which contain considerably lower amounts of omega-3 HUFAs. Carnivorous mammals and fishes must obtain omega-3 HUFAs from their diet, as they have lost the capacity to convert the precursor omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) into omega-3 HUFAs. Thus, the relative value of aquatic versus terrestrial insects depends not only on the fatty acid composition of the prey but also on the capacity of consumers to convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs. We used a combination of stable-isotope-labeled fatty acid tracers to ask whether, and how efficiently, tree swallows can deposit newly synthesized omega-3 HUFAs into tissue. Our data show for the first time that tree swallows can convert ALA into omega-3 HUFAs deposited in liver and skeletal muscle. However, high tree swallow demand for omega-3 HUFAs combined with low ALA availability in natural terrestrial foods may strain their modest conversion ability. This suggests that while tree swallows can synthesize omega-3 HUFAs de novo, omega-3 HUFAs are ecologically essential nutrients in natural systems. Our findings thus provide mechanistic support for our previous findings and the importance of omega-3 HUFA-rich aquatic insects for tree swallows and most likely other aerial insectivores with similar niches.

Mean muscle efficiency over this temperature range was 18% assuming perfect elastic energy storage and 22% assuming zero elastic energy storage. Both efficiency estimates increased significantly as Ta rose from 24 to 34°C. In all six species examined, WBF declined significantly with Ta. These data indicate that hovering orchid bees regulate heat production through changes in wingbeat kinematics and consequent changes in energy conversion by the flight motor. Temperature-dependent variation in elastic energy storage or muscle contraction efficiency or both may contribute to the observed trends."

456,Ultraviolet sensitivity and colour vision in raptor foraging.,"Raptors have excellent vision, yet it is unclear how they use colour information. It has been suggested that raptors use ultraviolet (UV) reflections from vole urine to find good hunting grounds. In contrast, UV plumage colours in songbirds such as blue tits are assumed to be 'hidden' communication signals, inconspicuous to raptors. This ambiguity results from a lack of knowledge about raptor ocular media transmittance, which sets the limit for UV sensitivity.

458,Hematological changes associated with egg production: estrogen dependence and repeatability.,"The 'cost of reproduction' (i.e. the trade-off between current reproduction and future fecundity and/or survival) is a central concept in life history theory, yet we still know very little about the physiological mechanisms underlying such costs. Recently it has been recognized that reproduction itself or the regulatory (hormonal) mechanisms underlying reproduction might result in 'costs' (cf. resource-allocation based mechanisms). As one example, it has been suggested that the decrease in hematocrit observed during egg production in birds might be due to antagonistic pleiotropic effects of estrogens. This could generate costs of reproduction by reducing oxygen-carrying capacity during subsequent aerobically demanding stages such as chick-provisioning. Here we show that the reduction in hematocrit during egg-laying is dependent on receptor-mediated actions of endogenous estrogens: blocking estrogen receptors using the anti-estrogen tamoxifen reduces the decrease in hematocrit during egg production in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) such that hematocrit at the 1-egg stage is not significantly different than pre-breeding, baseline values. We also show that both pre-breeding hematocrit and the decrease in hematocrit associated with egg production are repeatable, and that females with the highest pre-breeding hematocrit values tend to show the largest decreases in hematocrit during egg production.

Sound production was documented with high-speed video, acoustic measurements, air flow and sound pressure level recordings. The anatomy of the larynx was studied with computed tomography (CT) and dissections. Elephant CT vocal anatomy data were further compared with the anatomy of an adult human male. We observed numerous unusual phenomena, not typically reported in human vocal fold vibrations. Phase delays along both the inferior-superior and anterior-posterior (A-P) dimension were commonly observed, as well as transverse travelling wave patterns along the A-P dimension, previously not documented in the literature. Acoustic energy was mainly created during the instant of glottal opening.

463,How do C. elegans worms survive in highly viscous habitats?,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a filter feeder, which lives in various viscous habitats such as soil, the intestines of slugs, and rotting materials such as fruits and stems. C. elegans draws in suspensions of bacteria and separates bacteria from water using the pharyngeal pump. Although these worms often live in highly viscous habitats, it is still unclear how they survive in these environments by eating bacteria. In this study, we investigated the effects of suspension viscosity on the survival rate of malnutritioned worms by combining live imaging and scaling analyses. We found that survival rate decreased with increases in viscosity because the high viscosity suppressed the amount of food ingested. The same tendency was found in two feeding defective mutants, eat-6(ad467) and eat-6(ad997). We also found that the high viscosity weakened pump function, but the velocities in the pharynx were not zero, even in the most viscous suspensions. Finally, we estimated the amount of ingested food using scaling analyses, which provided a master curve of the experimental survival rates. These results illustrate that the survival rate of C. elegans worms is strongly dependent on the ingested bacteria per unit time associated with physical environments, such as the viscosity of food suspensions and the number density of bacteria. The pump function of the C. elegans pharynx is not completely lost even in fluids that have 105 times higher viscosity than water, which may contribute to their ability to survive around the world in highly viscous environments.",10.1242/jeb.224691,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34005560/,How do Caenorhabditis elegans worms survive in highly viscous habitats?,"ABSTRACT The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a filter feeder that lives in various viscous habitats such as soil, the intestines of slugs, and rotting materials such as fruits and stems.

464,Swimming in the upside down catfish Synodontis nigriventris: it matters which way is up.,"Synodontis nigriventris is a surface-feeding facultative air-breather that swims inverted with its zoological ventral side towards the water surface. Their near-surface drag is about double the deeply submerged drag (due to wave drag) and roughly twice the sum of frictional and pressure drags. For streamlined technical bodies, values of wave drag augmentation near the surface may be five times the deeply submerged values. However, the depth dependence of drag is similar for fish and streamlined technical bodies, with augmentation vanishing at about 3 body diameters below the surface. Drag ;inverted' is approximately 15% less than that ;dorsal side up' near the surface. Consistent with this, at any given velocity, tailbeat frequency is lower and stride length higher for inverted swimming in surface proximity (P<0.05). Deeply submerged, there are no significant differences in drag and kinematics between postures (P>0.05). At the critical Froude number of 0.45, speeds in surface proximity correspond to prolonged swimming that ends in fatigue. To exceed these speeds, the fish must swim deeply submerged and this behaviour is observed. Inverted swimming facilitates efficient air breathing. Drag dorsal side up during aquatic surface respiration is 1.5 times the value for the inverted posture. Fast-starts are rectilinear, directly away from the stimulus. Average and maximum velocity and acceleration decrease in surface proximity (P<0.05) and are higher inverted (maximum acceleration: 20-30 m s(-2); P<0.05) and comparable to locomotor generalists (e.g. trout). Mechanical energy losses due to wave generation are about 20% for inverted and 40% for dorsal side up, and lower than for trout fast-starting in shallow water (70% losses); bottom effects and large amplitude C-starts (c.f. relatively low amplitude rectilinear motions in S. nigriventris) enhance resistance in trout. S. nigriventris probably evolved from a diurnal or crepuscular 'Chiloglanis-like' benthic ancestor. Nocturnality and reverse countershading likely co-evolved with the inverted habit.

465,Sensory coding of nest-site value in honeybee swarms.,"This study investigates the first stage of the decision-making process of a honeybee swarm as it chooses a nest site: how a scout bee codes the value of a potential nest site in the waggle dances she produces to represent this site. We presented honeybee swarms with a two-alternative choice between a high-value site and a medium-value site and recorded the behavior of individually identifiable scout bees as they reported on these two alternatives. We found that bees performed equally lengthy inspections at the two sites, but that, on the swarm cluster, they performed more dance circuits per bee for the high-value site. We also found that there was much individual-level noise in the coding of site value, but that there were clear population-level differences in total dance circuits produced for the two sites. The first bee to find a site had a high probability of reporting the site with a waggle dance, regardless of its value. This discoverer-should-dance phenomenon may help ensure that a swarm gives attention to all discovered sites. There was rapid decay in the dance response; the number of dance circuits produced by a bee after visiting a site decreased linearly over sequential visits, and eventually each bee ceased visiting her site.

466,A three-dimensional kinematic analysis of tongue flicking in Python molurus.,"The forked snake tongue is a muscular organ without hard skeletal support. A functional interpretation of the variable arrangement of the intrinsic muscles along the tongue requires a quantitative analysis of the motion performance during tongue protrusion and flicking. Therefore, high-speed fluoroscopy and high-speed stereo photogrammetry were used to analyse the three-dimensional shape changes of the tongue in Python molurus bivittatus (Boidae). The posterior protruding part of the tongue elongated up to 130% while the flicking anterior portion elongated maximally 60%. The differences in tongue strains relate to the absence or presence, respectively, of longitudinal muscle fibres in the peripheral tongue. Maximum overall protrusion velocity (4.3 m s(-1)) occurred initially when the tongue tip left the mouth. Maximum tongue length of approximately 0.01 body length (20 mm) was reached during the first tongue flick. These observations are discussed within the scope of the biomechanical constraints of hydrostatic tongue protrusion: a negative forward pressure gradient, longitudinal tongue compliance and axial tongue stiffness. The three-dimensional deformation varied along the tongue with a mean curvature of 0.06 mm(-1) and a maximum value of 0.5 mm(-1).

The objective of this study was to understand how ocean acidification would affect the initial life stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a common species that is widely distributed in the Mediterranean Sea and the NE Atlantic. The effects of decreased pH (elevated P(CO(2))) were investigated through physiological and molecular analyses on both embryonic and larval stages. Eggs and larvae were reared in Mediterranean seawater at six pH levels, i.e. pH(T) 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5, 7.25 and 7.0. Fertilization success, survival, growth and calcification rates were monitored over a 3 day period. The expression of genes coding for key proteins involved in development and biomineralization was also monitored. Paracentrotus lividus appears to be extremely resistant to low pH, with no effect on fertilization success or larval survival. Larval growth was slowed when exposed to low pH but with no direct impact on relative larval morphology or calcification down to pH(T) 7.25. Consequently, at a given time, larvae exposed to low pH were present at a normal but delayed larval stage.

469,Maintenance of hindgut reabsorption during cold exposure is a key adaptation for Drosophila cold tolerance.,"Maintaining extracellular osmotic and ionic homeostasis is crucial for organismal function. In insects, hemolymph volume and ion content is regulated by the secretory Malpighian tubules and reabsorptive hindgut. When exposed to stressful cold, homeostasis is gradually disrupted, characterized by a debilitating increase in extracellular K+ concentration (hyperkalemia). Accordingly, studies have found a strong link between the species-specific cold tolerance and their ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis at low temperature. This is also true for drosophilids where inter- and intra-specific differences in cold tolerance are linked to the secretory capacity of Malpighian tubules. There is, however, little information on the reabsorptive capacity of the hindgut in Drosophila. To address this, we developed a novel method that permits continued measurements of hindgut ion and fluid reabsorption in Drosophila. We demonstrate that this assay is temporally stable (∼ 2 hours) and responsive to cAMP stimulation and pharmacological intervention in accordance with the current insect hindgut reabsorption model. We then investigated how cold acclimation or cold adaptation affected hindgut reabsorption at benign (24°C) and low temperature (3°C). Cold tolerant Drosophila species and cold-acclimated D. melanogaster maintain superior fluid and Na+ reabsorption at low temperature. Furthermore, cold adaptation and acclimation caused a relative reduction in K+ reabsorption at low temperature. These characteristic responses of cold adaptation/ acclimation will promote maintenance of ion and water homeostasis at low temperature.

470,"A field study of auditory sensitivity of the Atlantic puffin, Fratercula arctica.","Hearing is vital for birds as they rely on acoustic communication with parents, mates, chicks, and conspecifics. Amphibious seabirds face many ecological pressures, having to sense cues in air and underwater. Natural noise conditions have helped shape this sensory modality but anthropogenic noise is increasingly impacting seabirds. Surprisingly little is known about their hearing, despite their imperiled status. Understanding sound sensitivity is vital when we seek to manage manmade noise impacts.

471,Insect form vision as one potential shaping force of spider web decoration design.,"Properties of prey sensory systems are important factors shaping the design of signals generated by organisms exploiting them. In this study we assessed how prey sensory preference affected the exploiter signal design by investigating the evolutionary relationship and relative attractiveness of linear and cruciate form web decorations built by Argiope spiders. Because insects have an innate preference for bilaterally symmetrical patterns, we hypothesized that cruciate form decorations were evolved from linear form due to their higher visual attractiveness to insects. We first reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of the Asian members of the genus Argiope using mitochondrial markers to infer the evolutionary relationship of two decoration forms. Results of ancestral character state reconstruction showed that the linear form was ancestral and the cruciate form derived. To evaluate the luring effectiveness of two decoration forms, we performed field experiments in which the number and orientation of decoration bands were manipulated. Decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form were significantly more attractive to insects than those arranged in a linear form, no matter whether they were composed of silks or dummies. Moreover, dummy decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form attracted significantly more insects than those arranged in a vertical/horizontal form. Such results suggest that pollinator insects' innate preference for certain bilateral or radial symmetrical patterns might be one of the driving forces shaping the arrangement pattern of spider web decorations.",10.1242/jeb.037291,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20154191/,Insect form vision as one potential shaping force of spider web decoration design,"SUMMARY Properties of prey sensory systems are important factors shaping the design of signals generated by organisms exploiting them.

The present study focuses on the primary afferents giving origin to the slow path of the pulse-type weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum. We found that burst duration coders respond with a high-frequency train of spikes to each electric organ discharge. They also show high sensitivity to phase-frequency distortions of the self-generated local electric field. We explored this sensitivity by manipulating the longitudinal impedance of a probe cylinder to modulate the stimulus waveform, while extracellularly recording isolated primary afferents. Resistive loads only affect the amplitude of the re-afferent signals without distorting the waveform. Capacitive loads cause large waveform distortions aside from amplitude changes. Stepping from a resistive to a capacitive load in such a way that the stimulus waveform was distorted, without changing its total energy, caused strong changes in latency, inter-spike interval and number of spikes of primary afferent responses. These burst parameters are well correlated suggesting that they may contribute synergistically in driving downstream neurons.

This spatiotemporal memory (time-memory) is linked to the circadian clock and enables foragers to synchronize their behavior with floral nectar secretion rhythms, thus eliminating the need to rediscover productive food sources each day. Here, we asked whether the establishment of one time-memory influences the formation of another time-memory at the same time of day. In other words, can two time-place memories with the same ‘time-stamp’ co-exist? We simultaneously trained two groups of foragers from a single hive to two separate feeders at the same restricted time of day. After 5 days of training, one feeder was shut off. The second feeder continued being productive 4 more days. Our results showed that (1) foragers with high experience levels at the first source were significantly more likely than low-experience foragers to maintain fidelity to their original source and resist recruitment to the alternative source, (2) nearly one-third of foragers demonstrated multiple, overlapping time-memories by visiting both feeders at the correct time and (3) significantly more high-experience than low-experience foragers exhibited this multitasking behavior. The ability to maintain and act upon two different, yet contemporaneous, time-memories gives the forager bee a previously unknown level of versatility in attending to multiple food sources.

However, whereas extensive electrophysiological studies have been undertaken over the past ten years to characterize ionic currents underlying the physiological neuronal activity in honeybee, ionic currents underlying skeletal muscle fibre activity in this insect remain, so far, unexplored. Here, we show that, in contrast to many other insect species, action potentials in muscle fibres isolated from adult honeybee metathoracic tibia, are not graded but actual all-or-none responses. Action potentials are blocked by Cd(2+) and La(3+) but not by tetrodotoxin (TTX) in current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp technique, and as assessed under voltage-clamp, both Ca(2+) and K(+) currents are involved in shaping action potentials in single muscle fibres. The activation threshold potential for the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) current is close to -40 mV, its mean maximal amplitude is -8.5+/-1.9 A/F and the mean apparent reversal potential is near +40 mV. In honeybees, GABA does not activate any ionic membrane currents in muscle fibres from the tibia, but L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular synapse induces fast activation of an inward current when the membrane potential is voltage clamped close to its resting value. Instead of undergoing desensitization as is the case in many other preparations, a component of this glutamate-activated current has a sustained component, the reversal potential of which is close to 0 mV, as demonstrated with voltage ramps.

478,"In situ cardiac performance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at cold temperatures: long-term acclimation, acute thermal challenge and the role of adrenaline.","The resting and maximum in situ cardiac performance of Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) acclimated to 10, 4 and 0°C were measured at their respective acclimation temperatures, and when acutely exposed to temperature changes: i.e. hearts from 10°C fish cooled to 4°C, and hearts from 4°C fish measured at 10 and 0°C.

Parallels in limb muscle fascicle properties between bounding turtles and crocodylids suggest a possible musculoskeletal mechanism underlying the use of bounding gaits in particular lineages.

480,Seasonal oscillation of liver-derived hibernation protein complex in the central nervous system of non-hibernating mammals.,"Mammalian hibernation elicits profound changes in whole-body physiology. The liver-derived hibernation protein (HP) complex, consisting of HP-20, HP-25 and HP-27, was shown to oscillate circannually, and this oscillation in the central nervous system (CNS) was suggested to play a role in hibernation. The HP complex has been found in hibernating chipmunks but not in related non-hibernating tree squirrels, leading to the suggestion that hibernation-specific genes may underlie the origin of hibernation. Here, we show that non-hibernating mammals express and regulate the conserved homologous HP complex in a seasonal manner, independent of hibernation. Comparative analyses of cow and chipmunk HPs revealed extensive biochemical and structural conservations. These include liver-specific expression, assembly of distinct heteromeric complexes that circulate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and the striking seasonal oscillation of the HP levels in the blood and CNS. Central administration of recombinant HPs affected food intake in mice, without altering body temperature, physical activity levels or energy expenditure.

In order to correctly interpret the results stemming from these methods, it is crucial to understand how diet isotopic values are reflected in consumer tissues. In this study, we investigated patterns of isotopic discrimination between diet and blood constituents of two species of cetaceans (killer whale, Orcinus orca, and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus) fed controlled diets over 308 and 312 days, respectively. Diet discrimination factors (Δ; mean ± s.d.) for plasma were estimated to Δ(13)C=2.3±0.6‰ and Δ(15)N=1.8±0.3‰, respectively, for both species and to Δ(13)C=2.7±0.3‰ and Δ(15)N=0.5±0.1‰ for red blood cells. Delipidation did not have a significant effect on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of blood constituents, confirming that cetacean blood does not serve as a reservoir of lipids.

482,Pushing the limit: masticatory stress and adaptive plasticity in mammalian craniomandibular joints.,"Excessive, repetitive and altered loading have been implicated in the initiation of a series of soft- and hard-tissue responses or ;functional adaptations' of masticatory and locomotor elements. Such adaptive plasticity in tissue types appears designed to maintain a sufficient safety factor, and thus the integrity of given element or system, for a predominant loading environment(s). Employing a mammalian species for which considerable in vivo data on masticatory behaviors are available, genetically similar domestic white rabbits were raised on diets of different mechanical properties so as to develop an experimental model of joint function in a normal range of physiological loads. These integrative experiments are used to unravel the dynamic inter-relationships among mechanical loading, tissue adaptive plasticity, norms of reaction and performance in two cranial joint systems: the mandibular symphysis and temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Here, we argue that a critical component of current and future research on adaptive plasticity in the skull, and especially cranial joints, should employ a multifaceted characterization of a functional system, one that incorporates data on myriad tissues so as to evaluate the role of altered load versus differential tissue response on the anatomical, cellular and molecular processes that contribute to the strength of such composite structures. Our study also suggests that the short-term duration of earlier analyses of cranial joint tissues may offer a limited notion of the complex process of developmental plasticity, especially as it relates to the effects of long-term variation in mechanical loads, when a joint is increasingly characterized by adaptive and degradative changes in tissue structure and composition. Indeed, it is likely that a component of the adaptive increases in rabbit TMJ and symphyseal proportions and biomineralization represent a compensatory mechanism to cartilage degradation that serves to maintain the overall functional integrity of each joint system. Therefore, while variation in cranial joint anatomy and performance among sister taxa is, in part, an epiphenomenon of interspecific differences in diet-induced masticatory stresses characterizing the individual ontogenies of the members of a species, this behavioral signal may be increasingly mitigated in over-loaded and perhaps older organisms by the interplay between adaptive and degradative tissue responses.",10.1242/jeb.02683,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17267649/,Pushing the limit: masticatory stress and adaptive plasticity in mammalian craniomandibular joints,"SUMMARY Excessive, repetitive and altered loading have been implicated in the initiation of a series of soft- and hard-tissue responses or `functional adaptations' of masticatory and locomotor elements.

483,"Adenosinergic and cholinergic control mechanisms during hypoxia in the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), with emphasis on branchial circulation.","Coral reef platforms may become hypoxic at night during low tide. One animal in that habitat, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), survives hours of severe hypoxia and at least one hour of anoxia. Here, we examine the branchial effects of severe hypoxia (<0.3 mg oxygen l(-1) for 20 min in anaesthetized epaulette shark), by measuring ventral and dorsal aortic blood pressure (P(VA) and P(DA)), heart rate (fh), and observing gill microcirculation using epi-illumination microscopy. Hypoxia induced a flow of blood in two parallel blood vessels, termed longitudinal vessels, in the outer borders of the free tip of the gill filament. Hypoxia also induced significant falls in fh, P(VA) and P(DA), and a biphasic change in ventilation frequency (increase followed by decrease). Adenosine injection (1 micromol kg(-1)) also initiated blood flow in the longitudinal vessels, in addition to significant drops in P(VA), P(DA) and fh, and a biphasic response in ventilation frequency (decrease followed by increase) indicating that adenosine influences ventilation. Aminophylline (10 mg kg(-1)), an A(1) and A(2) adenosine receptor antagonist, blocked the effects of adenosine injection, and also significantly reduced blood flow in the longitudinal vessels during hypoxia.

485,High speed galloping in the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and the racing greyhound (Canis familiaris): spatio-temporal and kinetic characteristics.,"The cheetah and racing greyhound are of a similar size and gross morphology and yet the cheetah is able to achieve a far higher top speed. We compared the kinematics and kinetics of galloping in the cheetah and greyhound to investigate how the cheetah can attain such remarkable maximum speeds. This also presented an opportunity to investigate some of the potential limits to maximum running speed in quadrupeds, which remain poorly understood. By combining force plate and high speed video data of galloping cheetahs and greyhounds, we show how the cheetah uses a lower stride frequency/longer stride length than the greyhound at any given speed. In some trials, the cheetahs used swing times as low as those of the greyhounds (0.2 s) so the cheetah has scope to use higher stride frequencies (up to 4.0 Hz), which may contribute to it having a higher top speed that the greyhound. Weight distribution between the animal's limbs varied with increasing speed. At high speed, the hindlimbs support the majority of the animal's body weight, with the cheetah supporting 70% of its body weight on its hindlimbs at 18 m s(-1); however, the greyhound hindlimbs support just 62% of its body weight. Supporting a greater proportion of body weight on a particular limb is likely to reduce the risk of slipping during propulsive efforts.

486,Is human Achilles tendon deformation greater in regions where cross-sectional area is smaller?,"The Achilles is a long tendon varying in cross-sectional area (CSA) considerably along its length. For the same force, a smaller CSA would experience higher tendon stress and we hypothesised that these areas would therefore undergo larger transverse deformations. A novel magnetic resonance imaging-based approach was implemented to quantify changes in tendon CSA from rest along the length of the Achilles tendon under load conditions corresponding to 10%, 20% and 30% of isometric plantar flexor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Reductions in tendon CSA occurring during contraction from the resting condition were assumed to be proportional to the longitudinal elongations within those regions (Poisson's ratio).

487,Growth and the regulation of myotomal muscle mass in teleost fish.,"Teleost muscle first arises in early embryonic life and its development is driven by molecules present in the egg yolk and modulated by environmental stimuli including temperature and oxygen. Several populations of myogenic precursor cells reside in the embryonic somite and external cell layer and contribute to muscle fibres in embryo, larval, juvenile and adult stages. Many signalling proteins and transcription factors essential for these events are known. In all cases, myogenesis involves myoblast proliferation, migration, fusion and terminal differentiation. Maturation of the embryonic muscle is associated with motor innervation and the development of a scaffold of connective tissue and complex myotomal architecture needed to generate swimming behaviour. Adult muscle is a heterogeneous tissue composed of several cell types that interact to affect growth patterns. The development of capillary and lymphatic circulations and extramuscular organs--notably the gastrointestinal, endocrine, neuroendocrine and immune systems--serves to increase information exchange between tissues and with the external environment, adding to the complexity of growth regulation. Teleosts often exhibit an indeterminate growth pattern, with body size and muscle mass increasing until mortality or senescence occurs. The dramatic increase in myotomal muscle mass between embryo and adult requires the continuous production of muscle fibres until 40-50% of the maximum body length is reached. Sarcomeric proteins can be mobilised as a source of amino acids for energy metabolism by other tissues and for gonad generation, requiring the dynamic regulation of muscle mass throughout the life cycle. The metabolic and contractile phenotypes of muscle fibres also show significant plasticity with respect to environmental conditions, migration and spawning. Many genes regulating muscle growth are found as multiple copies as a result of paralogue retention following whole-genome duplication events in teleost lineages. The extent to which indeterminate growth, ectothermy and paralogue preservation have resulted in modifications of the genetic pathways regulating muscle growth in teleosts compared to mammals largely remains unknown.

488,Venom kinematics during prey capture in Conus: the biomechanics of a rapid injection system.,"Cone snails use an extensile, tubular proboscis as a conduit to deliver a potent cocktail of bioactive venom peptides into their prey. Previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom's role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms. Conus catus, a fish-hunting species, uses a high-speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow, spear-like radular tooth into prey. We take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses. Taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc-hunting juvenile cone snail, Conus pennaceus, we have determined that a high-speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey. Two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process. A constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis, composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments, impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion. Proximal to the constriction, a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis. In C. pennaceus, the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom.

489,The relative cost of using luminescence for sex and defense: light budgets in cypridinid ostracods.,"Luminescent signals can be used by animals for a number of purposes, including courtship and defense, sometimes by the same individual. However, the relative costs of producing these different behaviors are largely unknown. In the marine ostracod Photeros annecohenae, males utilize extracellular luminescence for complex courtship displays, and both males and females luminesce as a predation defense. We compared the relative luminescent output of courtship with that of defensive displays and also with respect to their total luminescent stores. Courtship displays are relatively inexpensive compared with defensive displays, with an average defensive display releasing 50 times more luminescence than the average courtship display. Furthermore, in order to completely exhaust its stores, a male would have to produce 450 typical courtship displays or approximately 10 average defensive displays. Both courtship pulses and defensive displays show first-order decay kinetics, yet courtship pulses decay three times faster than defensive displays, suggesting that there is differential release of the luciferin, luciferase and mucus in order to control the reaction kinetics.",10.1242/jeb.072017,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22837460/,The relative cost of using luminescence for sex and defense: light budgets in cypridinid ostracods,"SUMMARY Luminescent signals can be used by animals for a number of purposes, including courtship and defense, sometimes by the same individual.

491,"Energetic demands of immature sea otters from birth to weaning: implications for maternal costs, reproductive behavior and population-level trends.","Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any marine mammal, which is superimposed on the inherently high costs of reproduction and lactation in adult females. These combined energetic demands have been implicated in the poor body condition and increased mortality of female sea otters nearing the end of lactation along the central California coast. However, the cost of lactation is unknown and currently cannot be directly measured for this marine species in the wild. Here, we quantified the energetic demands of immature sea otters across five developmental stages as a means of assessing the underlying energetic challenges associated with pup rearing that may contribute to poor maternal condition. Activity-specific metabolic rates, daily activity budgets and field metabolic rates (FMR) were determined for each developmental stage. Mean FMR of pre-molt pups was 2.29 ± 0.81 MJ day(-1) and increased to 6.16 ± 2.46 and 7.41 ± 3.17 MJ day(-1) in post-molt pups and dependent immature animals, respectively. Consequently, daily energy demands of adult females increase 17% by 3 weeks postpartum and continue increasing to 96% above pre-pregnancy levels by the average age of weaning. Our results suggest that the energetics of pup rearing superimposed on small body size, marine living and limited on-board energetic reserves conspire to make female sea otters exceptionally vulnerable to energetic shortfalls.

492,Mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion: body-fluid interaction in undulatory swimming.,"Swimming of fish and other animals results from interactions of rhythmic body movements with the surrounding fluid. This paper develops a model for the body-fluid interaction in undulatory swimming of leeches, where the body is represented by a chain of rigid links and the hydrodynamic force model is based on resistive and reactive force theories. The drag and added-mass coefficients for the fluid force model were determined from experimental data of kinematic variables during intact swimming, measured through video recording and image processing. Parameter optimizations to minimize errors in simulated model behaviors revealed that the resistive force is dominant, and a simple static function of relative velocity captures the essence of hydrodynamic forces acting on the body. The model thus developed, together with the experimental kinematic data, allows us to investigate temporal and spatial (along the body) distributions of muscle actuation, body curvature, hydrodynamic thrust and drag, muscle power supply and energy dissipation into the fluid. We have found that: (1) thrust is generated continuously along the body with increasing magnitude toward the tail, (2) drag is nearly constant along the body, (3) muscle actuation waves travel two or three times faster than the body curvature waves and (4) energy for swimming is supplied primarily by the mid-body muscles, transmitted through the body in the form of elastic energy, and dissipated into the water near the tail.",10.1242/jeb.048751,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270304,Mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion: body–fluid interaction in undulatory swimming,"SUMMARY Swimming of fish and other animals results from interactions of rhythmic body movements with the surrounding fluid.

493,Long-day photoperiod interacts with vasopressin and food restriction to modulate reproductive status and vasopressin receptor expression of male golden spiny mice.,"We tested the effects of photoperiod, water and food availability on body mass, reproductive status and arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (Avpr1a) mRNA expression in males of desert-adapted golden spiny mice, Acomys russatus. In Experiment 1, males were acclimated to short-day (SD; 8 h:16 h light:dark) or long-day (LD; 16 h:8 h light:dark) photoperiods with either saline (control) or vasopressin treatment for 3 weeks. The results of this experiment revealed that under control conditions, SD mice increased body mass by ~5% while LD mice decreased it by ~4%.

494,Antarctic fish can compensate for rising temperatures: thermal acclimation of cardiac performance in Pagothenia borchgrevinki.,"Antarctic fish Pagothenia borchgrevinki in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, inhabit one of the coldest and most thermally stable of all environments. Sea temperatures under the sea ice in this region remain a fairly constant -1.86 degrees C year round. This study examined the thermal plasticity of cardiac function in P. borchgrevinki to determine whether specialisation to stable low temperatures has led to the loss of the ability to acclimate physiological function. Fish were acclimated to -1 degree C and 4 degrees C for 4-5 weeks and cardiac output was measured at rest and after exhaustive exercise in fish acutely transferred from their acclimation temperature to -1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 degrees C. In the -1 degree C acclimated fish, the factorial scope for cardiac output was greatest at -1 degree C and decreased with increasing temperature. Increases in cardiac output with exercise in the -1 degree C acclimated fish was achieved by increases in both heart rate and stroke volume. With acclimation to 4 degrees C, resting cardiac output was thermally independent across the test temperatures; furthermore, factorial scope for cardiac output was maintained at 4, 6 and 8 degrees C, demonstrating thermal compensation of cardiac function at the higher temperatures. This was at the expense of cardiac function at -1 degrees C, where there was a significant decrease in factorial scope for cardiac output in the 4 degrees C acclimated fish. Increases in cardiac output with exercise in the 4 degrees C acclimated fish at the higher temperatures was achieved by changes in heart rate alone, with stroke volume not varying between rest and exercise. The thermal compensation of cardiac function in P. borchgrevinki at higher temperatures was the result of a change in pumping strategy from a mixed inotropic/chronotropic modulated heart in -1 degrees C acclimated fish at low temperatures to a purely chronotropic modulated heart in the 4 degrees C acclimated fish at higher temperatures.

495,Ambient temperature affects multiple drivers of physiology and behaviour: adaptation for timely departure of obligate spring migrants.,"We investigated the role of ambient temperature in departure from wintering areas of migratory blackheaded buntings in spring. Birds transferred at 22 and 35 oC temperatures to long days were compared with one another and to controls held on short days for indices of readiness to migrate (Zugunruhe, fattening, weight gain), levels of testosterone, and gonadal recrudescence. Temperature affected the development of migratory behaviour and physiology: buntings under long days at 35oC, compared to those at 22oC, showed altered migratory behaviour (daily activity and Zugunruhe onset), and enhanced muscle growth and plasma testosterone levels; however, no effect on testis growth. Temperature was perceived at both peripheral and central levels, and affected multiple molecular drivers culminating into the migratory phenotype. This was evidenced by post-mortem comparison of the expression of 13 genes with known functions in the skin (temperature-sensitive TRP channels: trpv4 and trpm8), hypothalamus and/ or midbrain (migration-linked genes: th, ddc, adcyap1 and vps13a) and flight muscles (muscle growth associated genes: ar, srd5a3, pvalb, mtor, myod, mstn and hif1a).

496,Heat increment of feeding in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and its potential for thermal substitution.,"Diving endotherms inhabiting polar regions face potentially high thermoregulatory costs. Unless properly insulated, these animals will lose vast amounts of heat when diving in cold water, which has to be balanced by heat production. Heat generated as a by-product of digestion (heat increment of feeding, HIF) or from exercising muscles might be important in maintaining thermal balance under such conditions, as it would reduce the need for shivering thermogenesis. Recording the rate of oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and stomach temperature, we studied the magnitude and duration of HIF in seven double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) following the voluntary ingestion of a single herring (Clupea pallasi) while birds rested in air. Conducting trials at thermoneutral (21.1+/-0.2 degrees C) and sub-thermoneutral temperatures (5.5+/-0.7 degrees C), we investigated the potential of HIF for thermal substitution. After the ingestion of a 100 g herring at thermoneutral conditions, V(O(2))was elevated for an average of 328+/-28 min, during which time birds consumed 2697+/-294 ml O(2) in excess of the resting rate. At sub-thermoneutral conditions, duration (228+/-6 min) and magnitude (1391+/-271 ml O(2)) of V(O(2))elevation were significantly reduced. This indicates that cormorants are able to use the heat generated as by-product of digestion to substitute for regulatory thermogenesis, if heat loss is sufficiently high. Altering meal size during sub-thermoneutral trials, we also found that HIF in cormorants was significantly greater after larger food intake. Based on these experimental results, a simple calculation suggests that substitution from HIF might reduce the daily thermoregulatory costs of double-crested cormorants wintering in coastal British Columbia by approximately 38%.

498,Eating increases oxidative damage in a reptile.,"While eating has substantial benefits in terms of both nutrient and energy acquisition, there are physiological costs associated with digesting and metabolizing a meal. Frequently, these costs have been documented in the context of energy expenditure while other physiological costs have been relatively unexplored. Here, we tested whether the seemingly innocuous act of eating affects either systemic pro-oxidant (reactive oxygen metabolite, ROM) levels or antioxidant capacity of corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) by collecting plasma during absorptive (peak increase in metabolic rate due to digestion of a meal) and non-absorptive (baseline) states. When individuals were digesting a meal, there was a minimal increase in antioxidant capacity relative to baseline (4%), but a substantial increase in ROMs (nearly 155%), even when controlling for circulating nutrient levels. We report an oxidative cost of eating that is much greater than that due to long distance flight or mounting an immune response in other taxa. This result demonstrates the importance of investigating non-energetic costs associated with meal processing, and it begs future work to identify the mechanism(s) driving this increase in ROM levels.

However, conditioning of salivation or of related neural activities in non-mammalian species has not been reported. In many species of insects, salivation is regulated by salivary neurones. In this study, we found that salivary neurones of the cockroach Periplaneta americana exhibited a strong response to sucrose solution applied to the mouth and a weak response to odours applied to an antenna, and we studied the effect of conditioning on the activities of salivary neurones. After three sets of differential conditioning trials in which an odour was presented just before the presentation of sucrose solution and the other odour was presented alone, the response of salivary neurones to sucrose-associated odour significantly increased but that to the odour presented alone was unchanged. Backward pairing trials in which an odour was presented after the presentation of sucrose solution were not effective in achieving conditioning. Our study of the change in the level of saliva secretion in response to electrical stimulation of salivary neurones suggested that the magnitude of increase in odour response of salivary neurones by conditioning is sufficient to lead to an increased level of salivation.

501,The nervous system of Xenacoelomorpha: a genomic perspective.,"Xenacoelomorpha is, most probably, a monophyletic group that includes three clades: Acoela, Nemertodermatida and Xenoturbellida. The group still has contentious phylogenetic affinities; though most authors place it as the sister group of the remaining bilaterians, some would include it as a fourth phylum within the Deuterostomia. Over the past few years, our group, along with others, has undertaken a systematic study of the microscopic anatomy of these worms; our main aim is to understand the structure and development of the nervous system. This research plan has been aided by the use of molecular/developmental tools, the most important of which has been the sequencing of the complete genomes and transcriptomes of different members of the three clades. The data obtained has been used to analyse the evolutionary history of gene families and to study their expression patterns during development, in both space and time. A major focus of our research is the origin of 'cephalized' (centralized) nervous systems. How complex brains are assembled from simpler neuronal arrays has been a matter of intense debate for at least 100 years. We are now tackling this issue using Xenacoelomorpha models. These represent an ideal system for this work because the members of the three clades have nervous systems with different degrees of cephalization; from the relatively simple sub-epithelial net of Xenoturbella to the compact brain of acoels.

502,The importance of leading edge vortices under simplified flapping flight conditions at the size scale of birds.,"Over the last decade, interest in animal flight has grown, in part due to the possible use of flapping propulsion for micro air vehicles. The importance of unsteady lift-enhancing mechanisms in insect flight has been recognized, but unsteady effects were generally thought to be absent for the flapping flight of larger animals. Only recently has the existence of LEVs (leading edge vortices) in small vertebrates such as swifts, small bats and hummingbirds been confirmed. To study the relevance of unsteady effects at the scale of large birds [reduced frequency k between 0.05 and 0.3, k=(pifc)/U(infinity); f is wingbeat frequency, U(infinity) is free-stream velocity, and c is the average wing chord], and the consequences of the lack of kinematic and morphological refinements, we have designed a simplified goose-sized flapping model for wind tunnel testing. The 2-D flow patterns along the wing span were quantitatively visualized using particle image velocimetry (PIV), and a three-component balance was used to measure the forces generated by the wings. The flow visualization on the wing showed the appearance of LEVs, which is typically associated with a delayed stall effect, and the transition into flow separation. Also, the influence of the delayed stall and flow separation was clearly visible in measurements of instantaneous net force over the wingbeat cycle.

504,"The ontogenetic scaling of bite force and head size in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): implications for durophagy in neritic, benthic habitats.","Ontogenetic studies of vertebrate feeding performance can help address questions relevant to foraging ecology. Feeding morphology and performance can either limit access to food resources or open up new trophic niches in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Loggerhead sea turtles are long-lived vertebrates with complex life histories that are marked by an ontogenetic shift from an oceanic habitat to a coastal neritic habitat, and a transition from soft oceanic prey to hard, benthic prey. Although considered durophagous and strong biters, bite performance has not been measured in loggerheads, nor has the ontogeny of bite performance been characterized. In the present study, we collected measurements of bite force in loggerhead turtles from hatchlings to adults. When subadults reach the body size at which the ontogenetic shift occurs, their crushing capability is great enough for them to consume numerous species of hard benthic prey of small sizes. As loggerheads mature and bite performance increases, larger and harder benthic prey become accessible. Loggerhead bite performance eventually surpasses the crushing capability of other durophagous carnivores, thereby potentially reducing competition for hard benthic prey. The increasing bite performance and accompanying changes in morphology of the head and jaws are likely an effective mechanism for resource partitioning and decreasing trophic competition. Simultaneous measurements of body and head size and the use of non-linear reduced major axis regression show that bite force increases with significant positive allometry relative to body size (straight carapace length, straight carapace width and mass) and head size (head width, height and length). Simple correlation showed that all recorded morphometrics were good predictors of measured bite performance, but an AICc-based weighted regression showed that body size (straight carapace width followed by straight carapace length and mass, respectively) were more likely predictors of bite force than head size morphometrics (head width and head length).",10.1242/jeb.074385,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22899532/,"The ontogenetic scaling of bite force and head size in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): implications for durophagy in neritic, benthic habitats","SUMMARY Ontogenetic studies of vertebrate feeding performance can help address questions relevant to foraging ecology.

505,Using ultrasound to understand vascular and mantle contributions to venous return in the cephalopod Sepia officinalis L.,"Using ultrasound imaging, we investigated the roles of the potentially contractile veins and of the mantle (the powerful body wall that moves water over the gills, and also encloses the large veins and the hearts) in returning the blood of cuttlefish to its hearts. Ultrasound provided the first non-invasive observations of vascular function in an unanaesthetized, free-moving cephalopod. The large veins (anterior vena cava, lateral venae cavae and efferent branchial vessels) contracted in live, intact cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis L.).

Specifically, we quantified the number of lamellae and lamellar surface area (as if it were a flat sheet, not considering secondary lamellae) that comprise their olfactory organs. We also calculated the olfactory thresholds and relative effectiveness of amino acid odorants for each species. The olfactory organs varied in both the number of lamellae and lamellar surface area, which may be related to their general habitat, but neither correlated with olfactory threshold. Thresholds to amino acid odorants, major olfactory stimuli of all fishes, ranged from 10–9.0 to 10–6.9 mol l–1, which indicates that these elasmobranch species demonstrate comparable thresholds with teleosts. In addition, the relative effectiveness of amino acid stimuli to the olfactory organ of elasmobranchs is similar to that previously described in teleosts with neutral amino acids eliciting significantly greater responses than others. Collectively, these results indicate parallels in olfactory physiology between these two groups of fishes."
508,Unsteady forces and flows in low Reynolds number hovering flight: two-dimensional computations vs robotic wing experiments.,"We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D) computations and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case. In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3-5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude. As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal. This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that could be used by a flapping wing device. In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight. To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are important. A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here, the chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent.

509,How does the 'ancient' asexual Philodina roseola (Rotifera: Bdelloidea) handle potential UVB-induced mutations?,"Like other obligate asexuals, bdelloid rotifers are expected to suffer from degradation of their genomes through processes including the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

For comparison, we performed analogous experiments with the facultative asexual monogonont rotifer Brachionus rubens. Different strategies were found for the two species.

By contrast, B. rubens was more susceptible to UVB irradiation, but could repair all induced damage in ~2 h. In addition, whereas UV irradiation had a significant negative impact on the reproductive output of P. roseola, and especially so after desiccation, that of B. rubens was unaffected. Although the strategy of P. roseola might suffice under natural conditions where UVB irradiation is less intense, the lack of any immediate CPD repair mechanisms in this species remains perplexing.

511,Effects of flight speed upon muscle activity in hummingbirds.,"Hummingbirds have the smallest body size and highest wingbeat frequencies of all flying vertebrates, so they represent one endpoint for evaluating the effects of body size on sustained muscle function and flight performance. Other bird species vary neuromuscular recruitment and contractile behavior to accomplish flight over a wide range of speeds, typically exhibiting a U-shaped curve with maxima at the slowest and fastest flight speeds. To test whether the high wingbeat frequencies and aerodynamically active upstroke of hummingbirds lead to different patterns, we flew rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus, 3 g body mass, 42 Hz wingbeat frequency) in a variable-speed wind tunnel (0-10 m s(-1)). We measured neuromuscular activity in the pectoralis (PECT) and supracoracoideus (SUPRA) muscles using electromyography (EMG, N=4 birds), and we measured changes in PECT length using sonomicrometry (N=1). Differing markedly from the pattern in other birds, PECT deactivation occurred before the start of downstroke and the SUPRA was deactivated before the start of upstroke. The relative amplitude of EMG signal in the PECT and SUPRA varied according to a U-shaped curve with flight speed; additionally, the onset of SUPRA activity became relatively later in the wingbeat at intermediate flight speeds (4 and 6 m s(-1)). Variation in the relative amplitude of EMG was comparable with that observed in other birds but the timing of muscle activity was different. These data indicate the high wingbeat frequency of hummingbirds limits the time available for flight muscle relaxation before the next half stroke of a wingbeat. Unlike in a previous study that reported single-twitch EMG signals in the PECT of hovering hummingbirds, across all flight speeds we observed 2.9+/-0.8 spikes per contraction in the PECT and 3.8+/-0.8 spikes per contraction in the SUPRA. Muscle strain in the PECT was 10.8+/-0.5%, the lowest reported for a flying bird, and average strain rate was 7.4+/-0.2 muscle lengths s(-1). Among species of birds, PECT strain scales proportional to body mass to the 0.2 power (infinityM(b)(0.2)) using species data and infinityM(b)(0.3) using independent contrasts.

512,The fluid dynamics of flight control by kinematic phase lag variation between two robotic insect wings.,"Insects flying with two pairs of wings must contend with the forewing wake passing over the beating hindwing. Some four-winged insects, such as dragonflies, move each wing independently and therefore may alter the relative timing between the fore- and hindwing stroke cycles. The significance of modifying the phase relationship between fore- and hindwing stroke kinematics on total lift production is difficult to assess in the flying animal because the effect of wing-wake interference critically depends on the complex wake pattern produced by the two beating wings. Here we investigate the effect of changing the fore- and hindwing stroke-phase relationship during hovering flight conditions on the aerodynamic performance of each flapping wing by using a dynamically scaled electromechanical insect model. By varying the relative phase difference between fore- and hindwing stroke cycles we found that the performance of the forewing remains approximately constant, while hindwing lift production may vary by a factor of two. Hindwing lift modulation appears to be due to two different fluid dynamic phenomenons: leading edge vortex destruction and changes in strength and orientation of the local flow vector. Unexpectedly, the hindwing regains aerodynamic performance near to that of the wing free from forewing wake interference, when the motion of the hindwing leads the forewing by around a quarter of the stroke cycle. This kinematic relationship between hind- and forewing closely matches the phase-shift commonly used by locusts and some dragonflies in climbing and forward flight.

513,Molecular characterisation of SALMFamide neuropeptides in sea urchins.,"The SALMFamides are a family of neuropeptides found in species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. Members of this family have been identified in starfish (class Asteroidea) and in sea cucumbers (class Holothuroidea) but not in other echinoderms. Our aim here was to characterise SALMFamide neuropeptides in sea urchins (class Echinoidea). Radioimmunoassays for the starfish SALMFamides S1 and S2 were used to test for related peptides in whole-body acetone extracts of the sea urchin Echinus esculentus. Fractionation of extracts using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed several peaks of SALMFamide-like immunoreactivity, with two S2-like immunoreactive peaks (3 and 4) being the most prominent. However, peak 4 could not be purified to homogeneity and although peak 3 was purified, only a partial sequence (MRYH) could be obtained. An alternative strategy for identification of echinoid SALMFamides was provided by sequencing the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Analysis of whole-genome shotgun sequence data using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) identified a contig (347664) that contains a coding region for seven putative SALMFamide neuropeptides (PPVTTRSKFTFamide, DAYSAFSFamide, GMSAFSFamide, AQPSFAFamide, GLMPSFAFamide, PHGGSAFVFamide and GDLAFAFamide), which we have named SpurS1-SpurS7, respectively. Three of these peptides (SpurS1-3) have the C-terminal sequences TFamide or SFamide, which are identical or similar to the C-terminal region of the starfish SALMFamide S2. This may explain the occurrence of several S2-like immunoreactive peptides in extracts of Echinus esculentus. Detailed analysis of the sequence of contig 347664 indicated that the SALMFamide gene in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus comprises two exons, with the first exon encoding a signal peptide sequence and the second exon encoding SpurS1-SpurS7. Characterisation of this gene is important because it is the first echinoderm neuropeptide precursor sequence to be identified and, more specifically, it provides our first insight into the structure and organisation of a SALMFamide gene in an echinoderm.

Members of this family have been identified in starfish (class Asteroidea) and in sea cucumbers (class Holothuroidea) but not in other echinoderms. Our aim here was to characterise SALMFamide neuropeptides in sea urchins (class Echinoidea). Radioimmunoassays for the starfish SALMFamides S1 and S2 were used to test for related peptides in whole-body acetone extracts of the sea urchin Echinus esculentus. Fractionation of extracts using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed several peaks of SALMFamide-like immunoreactivity, with two S2-like immunoreactive peaks (3 and 4) being the most prominent. However, peak 4 could not be purified to homogeneity and although peak 3 was purified, only a partial sequence (MRYH) could be obtained. An alternative strategy for identification of echinoid SALMFamides was provided by sequencing the genome of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Analysis of whole-genome shotgun sequence data using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) identified a contig (347664) that contains a coding region for seven putative SALMFamide neuropeptides (PPVTTRSKFTFamide, DAYSAFSFamide, GMSAFSFamide, AQPSFAFamide, GLMPSFAFamide, PHGGSAFVFamide and GDLAFAFamide), which we have named SpurS1-SpurS7, respectively. Three of these peptides (SpurS1-3) have the C-terminal sequences TFamide or SFamide, which are identical or similar to the C-terminal region of the starfish SALMFamide S2. This may explain the occurrence of several S2-like immunoreactive peptides in extracts of Echinus esculentus. Detailed analysis of the sequence of contig 347664 indicated that the SALMFamide gene in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus comprises two exons, with the first exon encoding a signal peptide sequence and the second exon encoding SpurS1-SpurS7. Characterisation of this gene is important because it is the first echinoderm neuropeptide precursor sequence to be identified and, more specifically, it provides our first insight into the structure and organisation of a SALMFamide gene in an echinoderm.

515,Oxygen dependency of hydrogen sulfide-mediated vasoconstriction in cyclostome aortas.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has been proposed to mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction (HVC), however, other studies suggest the vasoconstrictory effect indirectly results from an oxidation product of H(2)S. Here we examined the relationship between H(2)S and O(2) in isolated hagfish and lamprey vessels that exhibit profound hypoxic vasoconstriction. In myographic studies, H(2)S (Na(2)S) dose-dependently constricted dorsal aortas (DA) and efferent branchial arteries (EBA) but did not affect ventral aortas or afferent branchial arteries; effects similar to those produced by hypoxia. Sensitivity of H(2)S-mediated contraction in hagfish and lamprey DA was enhanced by hypoxia. HVC in hagfish DA was enhanced by the H(2)S precursor cysteine and inhibited by amino-oxyacetate, an inhibitor of the H(2)S-synthesizing enzyme, cystathionine beta-synthase. HVC was unaffected by propargyl glycine, an inhibitor of cystathionine lambda-lyase. Oxygen consumption (M(O(2))) of hagfish DA was constant between 15 and 115 mmHg P(O(2)) (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), decreased when P(O(2)) <15 mmHg, and increased after P(O(2)) exceeded 115 mmHg. 10 micromol l(-1) H(2)S increased and > or =100 micromol l(-1) H(2)S decreased M(O(2)). Consistent with the effects on HVC, cysteine increased and amino-oxyacetate decreased M(O(2)). These results show that H(2)S is a monophasic vasoconstrictor of specific cyclostome vessels and because hagfish lack vascular NO, and vascular sensitivity to H(2)S was enhanced at low P(O(2)), it is unlikely that H(2)S contractions are mediated by either H(2)S-NO interaction or an oxidation product of H(2)S.

517,Median fin function during the escape response of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). I: Fin-ray orientation and movement.,"The fast-start escape response is critically important to avoid predation, and axial movements driving it have been studied intensively. Large median dorsal and anal fins located near the tail have been hypothesized to increase acceleration away from the threat, yet the contribution of flexible median fins remains undescribed. To investigate the role of median fins, C-start escape responses of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were recorded by three high-speed, high-resolution cameras at 500 frames s(-1) and the 3-D kinematics of individual dorsal and anal fin rays were analyzed. Movement and orientation of the fin rays relative to the body axis were calculated throughout the duration of the C-start. We found that: (1) timing and magnitude of angular displacement varied among fin rays based on position within the fin and (2) kinematic patterns support the prediction that fin rays are actively resisting hydrodynamic forces and transmitting momentum into the water. We suggest that regions within the fins have different roles. Anterior regions of the fins are rapidly elevated to increase the volume of water that the fish may interact with and transmit force into, thus generating greater total momentum. The movement pattern of all the fin rays creates traveling waves that move posteriorly along the length of the fin, moving water as they do so. Flexible posterior regions ultimately act to accelerate this water towards the tail, potentially interacting with vortices generated by the caudal fin during the C-start. Despite their simple appearance, median fins are highly complex and versatile control surfaces that modulate locomotor performance.",10.1242/jeb.068585,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22837461/,Median fin function during the escape response of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus).

518,"Cardiorespiratory modifications, and limitations, in post-smolt growth hormone transgenic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar.","In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in how growth hormone (GH) transgenesis affects fish physiology. However, the results of these studies are often difficult to interpret because the transgenic and non-transgenic fish had very different environmental/rearing histories. This study used a stable line of size-matched GH Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were reared in a shared tank with controls (at 10 degrees C, for approximately 9 months) to perform a comprehensive examination of the cardiorespiratory physiology of GH transgenic salmon, and serves as a novel test of the theory of symmorphosis. The GH transgenic salmon had a 3.6x faster growth rate, and 21 and 25% higher values for mass-specific routine and standard oxygen consumption (M(O(2))), respectively. However, there was no concurrent increase in their maximum M(O(2)), which resulted in them having an 18% lower metabolic scope and a 9% reduction in critical swimming speed. This decreased metabolic capacity/performance was surprising given that the transgenics had a 29% larger heart with an 18% greater mass-specific maximum in situ cardiac output, a 14% greater post-stress blood haemoglobin concentration, 5-10% higher red muscle and heart aerobic enzyme (citrate synthase or cytochrome oxidase) activities, and twofold higher resting and 1.7x higher post-stress, catecholamine levels. However, gill surface area was the only cardiorespiratory parameter that was not enhanced, and our data suggest that gill oxygen transfer may have been limiting. Overall, this research: (1) shows that there are significant metabolic costs associated with GH transgenesis in this line of Atlantic salmon; (2) provides the first direct evidence that cardiac function is enhanced by GH transgenesis; (3) shows that a universal upregulation of post-smolt (adult) GH transgenic salmon cardiorespiratory physiology, as suggested by symmorphosis, does not occur; and (4) supports the idea that whereas differences in arterial oxygen transport (i.e. cardiac output and blood oxygen carrying capacity) are important determinants of inter-specific differences in aerobicity, diffusion-limited processes must be enhanced to achieve substantial intra-specific improvements in metabolic and swimming performance.",10.1242/jeb.02105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16547302/,"Cardiorespiratory modifications, and limitations, in post-smolt growth hormone transgenic Atlantic salmon Salmo salar","SUMMARY In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in how growth hormone (GH) transgenesis affects fish physiology.

521,"Respiratory properties of blood in the harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena.","Harbor porpoises are active divers that exchange O(2) and CO(2) with the environment during a fast single breath upon surfacing. We investigated blood O(2)-transporting properties, buffer characteristics, Cl(-) transport via the erythrocyte anion exchanger (AE1), circulating nitric oxide metabolites and hemoglobin nitrite reduction in harbor porpoises with the aim to evaluate traits that are adaptive for diving behavior. Blood O(2) affinity was higher in harbor porpoises than in similar sized terrestrial mammals, as supported by our parallel recordings of O(2) equilibria in sheep and pig blood. Further, O(2) affinity tended to increase with increasing body mass. A high O(2) affinity favors O(2) extraction from the lungs, but a normal Bohr effect (ΔlogP(50)/ΔpH=-0.46) gradually lowers O(2) affinity during dives (where CO(2) accumulates) to assist O(2) off-loading to perfused tissues. The true plasma non-bicarbonate buffer value was moderately higher than in terrestrial mammals and increased upon deoxygenation. Plasma bicarbonate was also relatively high, contributing to increase the overall buffer capacity. The apparent Cl(-) permeability of harbor porpoise erythrocytes was similar to the human value at 37°C, showing absence of a comparative increase in the velocity of erythrocyte HCO(-)(3)/Cl(-) exchange to aid CO(2) excretion. The Q(10) for AE1-mediated Cl(-) transport in harbor porpoises was lower than in humans and seemed to match the Q(10) for metabolism (Q(10)≈2).

522,The pattern of motor coordination underlying the roll in the lamprey.,"The lamprey swims by caudally directed lateral undulations of its body. During swimming the animal is oriented with its dorsal side up, and any deviation from this posture (roll tilt) elicits a corrective motor response aimed at restoring the normal orientation. Video recording was used to study the kinematic pattern of the response to a 90 degrees roll tilt imposed in the intact lamprey. The corrective responses were associated with specific modifications of the swimming movements. The plane of locomotor undulations deviated from the normal, i.e. frontal plane in one direction at the beginning of the rotation and in the opposite direction at its end. A similar motor pattern was also observed in the anterior part of the body of lampreys in which the spinal cord had been transected in the mid-body area, when performing postural corrections. It could also be observed during roll turns performed by lampreys after a rostral hemisection of the spinal cord. We argue that these modifications of the locomotor pattern generate the moments of force necessary for initiation and termination of the corrective roll turn. Possible neuronal mechanisms causing the corrective movements are discussed.",10.1242/jeb.00451,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12819263/,The pattern of motor coordination underlying the roll in the lamprey,"SUMMARY The lamprey swims by caudally directed lateral undulations of its body.

524,Reactive oxygen species or reactive sulfur species: why we should consider the latter.,"The biological effects of oxidants, especially reactive oxygen species (ROS), include signaling functions (oxidative eustress), initiation of measures to reduce elevated ROS (oxidative stress), and a cascade of pathophysiological events that accompany excessive ROS (oxidative distress). Although these effects have long been studied in animal models with perturbed ROS, their actions under physiological conditions are less clear. I propose that some of the apparent uncertainty may be due to confusion of ROS with endogenously generated reactive sulfur species (RSS). ROS and RSS are chemically similar, but RSS are more reactive and versatile, and can be stored and reused. Both ROS and RSS signal via oxidation reactions with protein cysteine sulfur and they produce identical effector responses, but RSS appear to be more effective. RSS in the form of persulfidated cysteines (Cys-S-S) are produced endogenously and co-translationally introduced into proteins, and there is increasing evidence that many cellular proteins are persulfidated. A number of practical factors have contributed to confusion between ROS and RSS, and these are discussed herein. Furthermore, essentially all endogenous antioxidant enzymes appeared shortly after life began, some 3.8 billion years ago, when RSS metabolism dominated evolution. This was long before the rise in ROS, 600 million years ago, and I propose that these same enzymes, with only minor modifications, still effectively metabolize RSS in extant organisms.

525,Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology.,"Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, Aiptasia adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host.

528,Low external environmental calcium levels prevent forgetting in Lymnaea.,"Forgetting may allow an animal to react more appropriately to current conditions, rather than continuing to exhibit a previously learned, possibly maladaptive behaviour based on previous experience. One theory is that forgetting is an active process, whereby the previously learnt response is replaced by new learning that interferes with the older memory.

530,Vortex-wake interactions of a flapping foil that models animal swimming and flight.,"The fluid dynamics of many swimming and flying animals involves the generation and shedding of vortices into the wake. Here we studied the dynamics of similar vortices shed by a simple two-dimensional flapping foil in a soap-film tunnel. The flapping foil models an animal wing, fin or tail in forward locomotion. The vortical flow induced by the foil is correlated to (the resulting) thickness variations in the soap film. We visualized these thickness variations through light diffraction and recorded it with a digital high speed camera. This set-up enabled us to study the influence of foil kinematics on vortex-wake interactions. We varied the dimensionless wavelength of the foil (lambda*=4-24) at a constant dimensionless flapping amplitude (A*=1.5) and geometric angle of attack amplitude (A(alpha,geo)=15 degrees ). The corresponding Reynolds number was of the order of 1000. Such values are relevant for animal swimming and flight. We found that a significant leading edge vortex (LEV) was generated by the foil at low dimensionless wavelengths (lambda*<10). The LEV separated from the foil for all dimensionless wavelengths. The relative time (compared with the flapping period) that the unstable LEV stayed above the flapping foil increased for decreasing dimensionless wavelengths. As the dimensionless wavelength decreased, the wake dynamics evolved from a wavy von Kármán-like vortex wake shed along the sinusoidal path of the foil into a wake densely packed with large interacting vortices. We found that strongly interacting vortices could change the wake topology abruptly. This occurred when vortices were close enough to merge or tear each other apart.

Sap47 null mutants show defects in synaptic plasticity and larval olfactory associative learning but the molecular function of Sap47 at the synapse is unknown. We demonstrate that Sap47 modulates the phosphorylation of another highly abundant conserved presynaptic protein, synapsin. Site-specific phosphorylation of Drosophila synapsin has repeatedly been shown to be important for behavioural plasticity but it was not known where these phospho-synapsin isoforms are localized in the brain. Here, we report the distribution of serine-6-phosphorylated synapsin in the adult brain and show that it is highly enriched in rings of synapses in the ellipsoid body and in large synapses near the lateral triangle. The effects of knockout of Sap47 or synapsin on olfactory associative learning/memory support the hypothesis that both proteins operate in the same molecular pathway.

Sap47 null mutants show defects in synaptic plasticity and larval olfactory associative learning but the molecular function of Sap47 at the synapse is unknown. We demonstrate that Sap47 modulates the phosphorylation of another highly abundant conserved presynaptic protein, synapsin. Site-specific phosphorylation of Drosophila synapsin has repeatedly been shown to be important for behavioural plasticity but it was not known where these phospho-synapsin isoforms are localized in the brain. Here, we report the distribution of serine-6-phosphorylated synapsin in the adult brain and show that it is highly enriched in rings of synapses in the ellipsoid body and in large synapses near the lateral triangle. The effects of knockout of Sap47 or synapsin on olfactory associative learning/memory support the hypothesis that both proteins operate in the same molecular pathway.

537,"Quantitative analysis of crypt cell population during postnatal development of the olfactory organ of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata (Teleostei, Poecilidae), from birth to sexual maturity.","Crypt cells are one of three types of olfactory sensory neuron, differing from ciliated and microvillar cells in shape, localization and number, and found only in fish. Although crypt cells are morphologically well characterized, their function remains unclear. They were hypothesized to be involved in reproductive behaviours by detecting sex pheromones, but electrophysiological investigations revealed sensitivity to only amino acids. However, the number of crypt cells in adult guppies is not the same in the two sexes. In this study, we compared the size of the crypt cell population in juvenile guppies during the first 90 days after birth. The purpose of our study was to clarify whether a correlation exists between sex and the number of these olfactory neurons. The data show that guppies reach adult crypt cell density when they become sexually mature. Despite a constant increment in volume during development of the olfactory organ, the minimum density of crypt neurons occurs at ~45 days. Moreover, in the early weeks, the density of crypt neurons is greater in males than in females because in females the total number of cells decreases significantly after just 7 days. In adults, however, crypt neurons are found in higher density in females than in males. These findings suggest that the number of crypt cells is sex specific, with independent developmental dynamics between males and females. A role in pheromone detection could explain such a difference, but the early appearance of crypt cells in the first days of life is suggestive of other, not sexually related, functions.",10.1242/jeb.069039,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22786649/,"Quantitative analysis of crypt cell population during postnatal development of the olfactory organ of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata (Teleostei, Poecilidae), from birth to sexual maturity","SUMMARY Crypt cells are one of three types of olfactory sensory neuron, differing from ciliated and microvillar cells in shape, localization and number, and found only in fish.

539,Development-specific transcriptomic profiling suggests new mechanisms for anoxic survival in the ventricle of overwintering turtles.,"Oxygen deprivation swiftly damages tissues in most animals, yet some species show remarkable abilities to tolerate little or even no oxygen. Painted turtles exhibit a development-dependent tolerance that allows adults to survive anoxia approximately four times longer than hatchlings: adults survive ∼170 days and hatchlings survive ∼40 days at 3°C. We hypothesized that this difference is related to development-dependent differences in ventricular gene expression. Using a comparative ontogenetic approach, we examined whole transcriptomic changes before, during and 5 days after a 20-day bout of anoxic submergence at 3°C. Ontogeny accounted for more gene expression differences than treatment (anoxia or recovery): 1175 versus 237 genes, respectively. Of the 237 differences, 93 could confer protection against anoxia and reperfusion injury, 68 could be injurious and 20 may be constitutively protective. Most striking during anoxia was the main expression pattern of all 76 annotated ribosomal protein (R-protein) mRNAs, which decreased in anoxia-tolerant adults, but increased in anoxia-sensitive hatchlings, suggesting adult-specific regulation of translational suppression.

540,The extraordinary joint material of an articulated coralline alga. II. Modeling the structural basis of its mechanical properties.,"By incorporating joints into their otherwise rigid fronds, erect coralline algae have evolved to be as flexible as other seaweeds, which allows them to thrive - and even dominate space - on wave-washed shores around the globe. However, to provide the required flexibility, the joint tissue of Calliarthron cheilosporioides, a representative articulated coralline alga, relies on an extraordinary tissue that is stronger, more extensible and more fatigue resistant than that of other algae. Here, we used the results from recent experiments to parameterize a conceptual model that links the microscale architecture of cell walls to the adaptive mechanical properties of joint tissue. Our analysis suggests that the theory of discontinuous fiber-wound composite materials (with cellulose fibrils as the fibers and galactan gel as the matrix) can explain key aspects of the material's mechanics. In particular, its adaptive viscoelastic behavior can be characterized by two, widely separated time constants. We speculate that the short time constant (∼14 s) results from the viscous response of the matrix to the change in cell-wall shape as a joint is stretched, a response that allows the material both to remain flexible and to dissipate energy as a frond is lashed by waves. We propose that the long time constant (∼35 h), is governed by the shearing of the matrix between cellulose fibrils. The resulting high apparent viscosity ensures that joints avoid accumulating lethal deformation in the course of a frond's lifetime.

Summary: Variation in water temperature during early development in sea bream alters the response of adult fish to a cold challenge and is associated with a change in whole animal physiology and bone homeostasis.",True,"Fish are ectotherms and temperature plays a determinant role in their physiology, biology and ecology, and is a driver of seasonal responses. The present study assessed how thermal imprinting during embryonic and larval stages modified the response of adult fish to low water temperature. We targeted the gilthead sea bream, which develops a condition known as winter syndrome when it is exposed to low water temperatures. Eggs and larvae of sea bream were exposed to four different thermal regimes and then the response of the resulting adults to a low temperature challenge was assessed. Sea bream exposed to a high–low thermal regime as eggs and larvae (HLT; 22°C until hatch and then 18°C until larvae–juvenile transition) had increased plasma cortisol and lower sodium and potassium in response to a cold challenge compared with the other thermal history groups. Plasma glucose and osmolality were increased in cold-challenged HLT fish relative to the unchallenged HLT fish. Cold challenge modified bone homeostasis/responsiveness in the low–high thermal regime group (LHT) relative to other groups, and ocn, ogn1/2, igf1, gr and trα/β transcripts were all downregulated.

544,Interactions of visual odometry and landmark guidance during food search in honeybees.,"How do honeybees use visual odometry and goal-defining landmarks to guide food search? In one experiment, bees were trained to forage in an optic-flow-rich tunnel with a landmark positioned directly above the feeder. Subsequent food-search tests indicated that bees searched much more accurately when both odometric and landmark cues were available than when only odometry was available. When the two cue sources were set in conflict, by shifting the position of the landmark in the tunnel during test, bees overwhelmingly used landmark cues rather than odometry. In another experiment, odometric cues were removed by training and testing in axially striped tunnels. The data show that bees did not weight landmarks as highly as when odometric cues were available, tending to search in the vicinity of the landmark for shorter periods. A third experiment, in which bees were trained with odometry but without a landmark, showed that a novel landmark placed anywhere in the tunnel during testing prevented bees from searching beyond the landmark location. Two further experiments, involving training bees to relatively longer distances with a goal-defining landmark, produced similar results to the initial experiment. One caveat was that, with the removal of the familiar landmark, bees tended to overshoot the training location, relative to the case where bees were trained without a landmark.

Previous work showed that females possess sexually dimorphic, horn-like rostral swim bladder extensions that extend toward the primary auditory end organs, the saccule and lagena. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rostral swim bladder extensions in females increase auditory sensitivity to sound pressure and higher frequencies, which potentially could enhance mate detection and localization in shallow-water habitats. We recorded the auditory evoked potentials that originated from hair cell receptors in the saccule of control females with intact swim bladders and compared them with those from treated females (swim bladders removed) and type I males (intact swim bladders lacking rostral extensions). Saccular potentials were recorded from hair cell populations in vivo while behaviorally relevant pure-tone stimuli (75–1005 Hz) were presented by an underwater speaker. The results indicate that control females were approximately 5–11 dB re. 1 µPa more sensitive to sound pressure than treated females and type I males at the frequencies tested.

To date, however, very little experimental work has been carried out to understand the mechanisms that bats use to perform maneuvers. In the present study, we examined the kinematics of slow-speed turning flight in the lesser short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis, to understand the basic mechanics employed to perform maneuvers and to compare them with previous findings in bats and other flying organisms. Four individuals were trained to fly in L-shaped flight enclosure that required them to make a 90 deg. turn midway through each flight. Flights were recorded with three low-light, high-speed videocameras, allowing the three-dimensional reconstruction of the body and wing kinematics. For any flying organisms, turning requires changes of the direction of travel and the reorientation of the body around the center of mass to maintain the alignment with the flight direction. In C. brachyotis, changes in body orientation (i.e. heading) took place during upstroke and preceded the changes in flight direction, which were restricted to the downstroke portion of the wingbeat cycle. Mean change in flight direction was significantly correlated to the mean heading angular velocity at the beginning of the downstroke and to the mean bank angle during downstroke, although only heading velocity was significant when both variables were considered.

Body reorientation prior to changes in direction might be a mechanism to maintain the head and body aligned with the direction of travel and, thus, maximizing spatial accuracy in three-dimensionally complex environments.",True,"Maneuvering abilities have long been considered key factors that influence habitat selection and foraging strategies in bats. To date, however, very little experimental work has been carried out to understand the mechanisms that bats use to perform maneuvers. In the present study, we examined the kinematics of slow-speed turning flight in the lesser short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis, to understand the basic mechanics employed to perform maneuvers and to compare them with previous findings in bats and other flying organisms. Four individuals were trained to fly in L-shaped flight enclosure that required them to make a 90 deg. turn midway through each flight. Flights were recorded with three low-light, high-speed videocameras, allowing the three-dimensional reconstruction of the body and wing kinematics. For any flying organisms, turning requires changes of the direction of travel and the reorientation of the body around the center of mass to maintain the alignment with the flight direction.

Biochemical studies on acclimation responses in ectotherms have so far mainly investigated consequences of short-term acclimation at the adult stage and focussed on adaptive responses. Here, we assessed the consequences of rearing Drosophila melanogasterat low (12°C), benign (25°C) and high (31°C) temperatures. We assessed cold and heat tolerance and obtained detailed proteomic profiles of flies from the three temperatures. The proteomic profiles provided a holistic understanding of the underlying biology associated with both adaptive and non-adaptive temperature responses. Results show strong benefits and costs across tolerances: rearing at low temperature increased adult cold tolerance and decreased adult heat tolerance and vice versa with development at high temperatures. In the proteomic analysis, we were able to identify and quantify a large number of proteins compared with previous studies on ectotherms (1440 proteins across all replicates and rearing regimes), enabling us to extend the proteomic approach using enrichment analyses. This gave us detailed information on individual proteins, as well as pathways affected by rearing temperature, pinpointing potential mechanisms responsible for the strong costs and benefits of rearing temperature on functional phenotypes.

553,Effect of pH on the rate of myosin head detachment in molluscan catch muscle: are myosin heads involved in the catch state?,"Moderate alkalisation is known to terminate the catch state of bivalve mollusc smooth muscles such as the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus edulis L. In the present study, we investigated the effect of moderate alkalisation (pH 7.2-7.7 vs control pH 6.7) on the myosin head detachment rate in saponin-skinned fibre bundles of ABRM in order to investigate the possible role of myosin heads in the force maintenance during catch. The detachment rate of myosin heads was deduced from two types of experiments. (1) In stretch experiments on maximally Ca2+-activated fibre bundles (pCa 4.5), the rate of force decay after stepwise stretch was assessed. (2) In ATP step experiments, the rate of force decay from high force rigor (pCa>8) was evaluated. The ATP step was induced by photolysis of caged ATP. We found that moderate alkalisation induces relaxation of skinned fibres in catch, thereby reducing both force and stiffness, whereas it does not accelerate the rate of myosin head detachment. This acceleration, however, would be expected if catch would be simply due to myosin heads remaining sustainably attached to actin filaments. Thus, the myosin heads may be less involved in catch than generally assumed.

554,"Effects of altering flow and odor information on plume tracking behavior in walking cockroaches, Periplaneta americana (L.).","Animals using odor plumes to locate resources are activated to track these plumes by the presence of an attractive odor, and typically steer toward the source using directional cues from the flowing air or water bearing the odor. We challenged freely walking virgin male cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, to track plumes of airborne female pheromone and then video-recorded and analyzed their responses as the odor plume and wind were independently manipulated. Plume tracking males that experienced the total loss of directional air flow halfway to the odor source showed little change in their performance, and 100% were able to quickly locate the pheromone source. By contrast, males experiencing a sudden loss of odor while tracking a plume rapidly changed their behavior; often turning downwind and retracing their steps to the release point, or walking in loops, but rarely moving upwind to the previous location of the source. In a subsequent experiment, in order to determine whether a memory of the previously experienced wind direction could provide the directional information necessary to locate an odor source, we challenged males to track plumes in zero wind after pre-exposing them to: (1) wind and pheromone, (2) wind only, and (3) neither wind nor pheromone. These were compared to males tracking a wind-borne pheromone plume, in which case, all males were able to locate the pheromone source. Our results show that males require the detection of wind and pheromone simultaneously during plume tracking in order to quickly and efficiently locate the odor source.

555,Early-life hypoxia alters adult physiology and reduces stress resistance and lifespan in Drosophila.,"In many animals, short-term fluctuations in environmental conditions in early life often exert long-term effects on adult physiology. In Drosophila, one ecologically relevant environmental variable is hypoxia. Drosophila larvae live on rotting, fermenting food rich in microorganisms - an environment characterized by low ambient oxygen. They have therefore evolved to tolerate hypoxia. While the acute effects of hypoxia in larvae have been well studied, whether early-life hypoxia affects adult physiology and fitness is less clear. Here we show that Drosophila exposed to hypoxia during their larval period subsequently show reduced starvation stress resistance and shorter lifespan as adults, with these effects being stronger in males. We find that these effects are associated with reduced whole-body insulin signaling but elevated TOR kinase activity, a manipulation known to reduce lifespan. We also identify a sexually dimorphic effect of larval hypoxia on adult nutrient storage and mobilization. Thus, we find that males, but not females, show elevated levels of lipids and glycogen.

556,Olfactory specialization for perfume collection in male orchid bees.,"Insects rely on the olfactory system to detect a vast diversity of airborne molecules in their environment. Highly sensitive olfactory tuning is expected to evolve when detection of a particular chemical with great precision is required in the context of foraging and/or finding mates. Male neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) collect odoriferous substances from multiple sources, store them in specialized tibial pouches and later expose them at display sites, presumably as mating signals to females. Previous analysis of tibial compounds among sympatric species revealed substantial chemical disparity in chemical composition among lineages with outstanding divergence between closely related species. Here, we tested whether specific perfume phenotypes coevolve with matching olfactory adaptations in male orchid bees to facilitate the location and harvest of species-specific perfume compounds. We conducted electroantennographic (EAG) measurements on males of 15 sympatric species in the genus Euglossa that were stimulated with 18 compounds present in variable proportions in male hind tibiae. Antennal response profiles were species-specific across all 15 species, but there was no conspicuous differentiation between closely related species. Instead, we found that the observed variation in EAG activity follows a Brownian motion model of trait evolution, where the probability of differentiation increases proportionally with lineage divergence time. However, we identified strong antennal responses for some chemicals that are present as major compounds in the perfume of the same species, thus suggesting that sensory specialization has occurred within multiple lineages. This sensory specialization was particularly apparent for semi-volatile molecules ('base note' compounds), thus supporting the idea that such compounds play an important role in chemical signaling of euglossine bees.

557,Plasticity of non-shivering thermogenesis and brown adipose tissue in high-altitude deer mice.,"High altitude environments challenge small mammals with persistent low ambient temperatures that require high rates of aerobic heat production in face of low O2 availability.

Based on the following key points, we concluded that anophelines differ from culicines in larval rectal structure and in regulation of protein expression: (1) despite the fact that obligate freshwater and saline-tolerant culicines have structurally distinct recta, all anophelines examined (regardless of saline-tolerance) have a structurally similar rectum consisting of distinct DAR (dorsal anterior rectal) cells and non-DAR cells; (2) anopheline larvae undergo a dramatic shift in rectal Na+/K+-ATPase localization when reared in freshwater vs saline water. This shift is not seen in any culicine larvae examined. Additionally, we use these immunohistochemical analyses to suggest possible functions for the DAR and non-DAR cells of anopheline larvae in freshwater and saline conditions."
559,Mating-induced transient inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in a male moth is not mediated by octopamine or serotonin.,"In the male moth, Agrotis ipsilon, mating induces a transient inhibition of behavioural and central nervous responses to sex pheromone. Newly mated males are not attracted to sex pheromone, and the sensitivity of their antennal lobe (AL) neurons is lower than in virgin males. This rapid transient olfactory inhibition prevents them from re-mating unsuccessfully until they have refilled their sex glands. We hypothesized that this olfactory 'switch off' might be controlled by neuromodulators such as biogenic amines. To test our hypothesis, we studied the effects of octopamine (OA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) on the coding properties of pheromone-sensitive AL neurons in virgin and newly mated males. We show that AL neuron sensitivity increased in newly mated males after injection of OA or 5-HT, but only OA treatment affected certain response characteristics of AL neurons in virgin males. Whereas all measured AL neuron response characteristics were different between virgin and newly mated males, amine treatment in newly mated males restored only the latency and spike frequency, but not the duration of excitatory and inhibitory phases, which were initially found in virgin males. Additionally, we investigated the behavioural effects of OA and 5-HT treatments in virgin and mated males. Although OA and 5-HT enhanced the general flight activity of newly mated males, amine treatments did not restore the behavioural pheromone response of mated moths. Altogether, these results show that, although biogenic amines modulate the olfactory system in moths, OA and 5-HT are probably not involved in the post-mating inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in A. ipsilon males.",10.1242/jeb.040139,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20228346/,Mating-induced transient inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in a male moth is not mediated by octopamine or serotonin,"SUMMARY In the male moth, Agrotis ipsilon, mating induces a transient inhibition of behavioural and central nervous responses to sex pheromone.

One approach to understand the impact of rising temperatures on animals and their ability to cope with climate change is to quantify variation in thermal-sensitive traits. Here, we examined the thermal biology, the temperature dependence and the thermal plasticity of bite force (endurance and magnitude) in Diplolaemus leopardinus, an aggressive and territorial lizard, endemic to Mendoza province, Argentina. Our results indicated that this lizard behaves like a moderate thermoregulator which uses the rocks of its environment as the main heat source. Bite endurance was not influenced by head morphometry and body temperature, whereas bite force was influenced by head length and jaw length, and exhibited thermal dependence. Before thermal acclimation treatments, the maximum bite force for D. leopardinus occured at the lowest body temperature and fell sharply with increasing body temperature. After acclimation treatments, lizards acclimated at higher temperatures exhibited greater bite force.

A goal of comparative studies in the biology of aging is to identify genetic and biochemical mechanism(s) driving species-specific differences in the aging process that are the end product of life history trade-offs. We hypothesized that cells from long-lived bird species are more resistant to stress agents than are cells from short-lived species, and that cells from birds are more resistant to stress than are cells from relatively short-lived mammals of similar size.

566,High-speed gallop locomotion in the thoroughbred racehorse. I. The effect of incline on stride parameters.,"During locomotion up an incline, power is required to elevate the centre of mass. This is provided when the animal's limbs are in contact with the ground. Measurements of stride timing variables from multiple limbs during high speed, over-ground locomotion would enhance our understanding of locomotor powering during changes in terrain. This study measured foot-on and foot-off times from galloping horses using a previously validated system of limb-mounted accelerometers and a global positioning system data logger. A detailed track survey provided incline information from all areas of the track. Measurements were made from six horses over a speed range of 9 to 13 m s(-1).

The relationship between track incline and measured variables was assessed. Stride variables from horses galloping on level (0-2% incline) and incline (8-12% incline) sections of the track were compared. Fore- and hindlimb protraction durations were significantly reduced across the speed range during incline galloping (P=0.001).

This resulted in a mean increase in stride frequency from 2.01 to 2.08 strides s–1 at 9.5 m s–1 and 2.10 to 2.17 strides s–1 at 12.5 m s–1 during incline galloping. Duty factor was significantly greater for the hindlimbs during incline galloping (P<0.001), increasing from 0.31 to 0.32 at 9.5 m s–1 and 0.28 to 0.29 at 12.5 m s–1. Peak limb force was calculated from duty factor and assumed fore- to hindlimb impulse distributions. Smaller peak vertical forces were calculated in the forelimbs and increased peak vertical forces were calculated in the hindlimbs when galloping on an incline. Measured changes in stride timing variables differ from those reported in trotting horses. We propose that horses increase their stride frequency at a given speed during incline galloping to provide power for moving the centre of mass up the slope."

568,Thermodynamics of oxygenation-linked proton and lactate binding govern the temperature sensitivity of O2 binding in crustacean (Carcinus maenas) hemocyanin.,"With the aim of understanding the molecular underpinnings of the enormous variation in the temperature sensitivity of hemocyanin-O2 affinity encountered in crustaceans, we measured O2 binding to Carcinus maenas hemocyanin at two temperatures, varying pH values and in the absence and presence of lactate ions in order to assess the contributions of oxygenation-linked binding of protons (the Bohr effect) and lactate ions to the overall enthalpies of oxygenation (DeltaH'). The hemocyanin binds maximally 0.35 lactate ions per functional subunit. Lactate (which accumulates under hypoxic conditions) increases O2 affinity by preferentially raising the association equilibrium constant of the hemocyanin in the low-affinity Tense state (KT), without significantly affecting that of the high-affinity Relaxed state (KR). In the absence of lactate, the variation in the temperature sensitivity observed with decreasing pH tallies neatly with changes in the nature and magnitude of the Bohr effect. Accordingly, the normal, absent and reverse Bohr effects observed under alkaline, neutral and acid conditions, respectively, reflect endothermic proton dissociation, absence of proton binding and exothermic proton association, respectively, upon oxygen binding. Oxygenation-linked lactate binding is exothermic, highly pH dependent and peaks near pH 7.6, where it contributes approximately -30 kJ mol(-1) to the overall heat of oxygenation.

570,Wing and body kinematics of takeoff and landing flight in the pigeon (Columba livia).,"Takeoff and landing are critical phases in a flight. To better understand the functional importance of the kinematic adjustments birds use to execute these flight modes, we studied the wing and body movements of pigeons (Columba livia) during short-distance free-flights between two perches. The greatest accelerations were observed during the second wingbeat of takeoff. The wings were responsible for the majority of acceleration during takeoff and landing, with the legs contributing only one-quarter of the acceleration. Parameters relating to aerodynamic power output such as downstroke amplitude, wingbeat frequency and downstroke velocity were all greatest during takeoff flight and decreased with each successive takeoff wingbeat. This pattern indicates that downstroke velocity must be greater for accelerating flight to increase the amount of air accelerated by the wings. Pigeons used multiple mechanisms to adjust thrust and drag to accelerate during takeoff and decelerate during landing. Body angle, tail angle and wing plane angles all shifted from more horizontal orientations during takeoff to near-vertical orientations during landing, thereby reducing drag during takeoff and increasing drag during landing. The stroke plane was tilted steeply downward throughout takeoff (increasing from -60+/-5 deg. to -47+/-1 deg.), supporting our hypothesis that a downward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air rearward to accelerate the bird forward. Similarly, the stroke plane tilted upward during landing (increasing from -1+/-2 deg. to 17+/-7 deg.), implying that an upward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air forward to slow the bird down. Rotations of the stroke plane, wing planes and tail were all strongly correlated with rotation of the body angle, suggesting that pigeons are able to redirect aerodynamic force and shift between flight modes through modulation of body angle alone.",10.1242/jeb.038109,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20435815/,Wing and body kinematics of takeoff and landing flight in the pigeon (Columba livia),"SUMMARY Takeoff and landing are critical phases in a flight.

572,Mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of fluctuating thermal regimes in insect cold tolerance.,"Insects exposed to low temperature often have high mortality or exhibit sublethal effects. A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various '-omics' techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints.

576,Shock attenuation in the human lumbar spine during walking and running.,"During locomotion, each step generates a shock wave that travels through the body toward the head. Without mechanisms for attenuation, repeated shocks can lead to pathology. Shock attenuation (SA) in the lower limb has been well studied, but little is known about how posture affects SA in the spine. To test the hypothesis that lumbar lordosis (LL) contributes to SA, 27 adults (14 male, 13 female) walked and ran on a treadmill. Two lightweight, tri-axial accelerometers were affixed to the skin overlying T12/L1 and L5/S1. Sagittal plane accelerations were analyzed using power spectral density analysis, and lumbar SA was assessed within the impact-related frequency range. 3D kinematics quantified dynamic and resting LL. To examine the effects of intervertebral discs on spinal SA, supine MRI scans were used to measure disc morphology. The results showed no association between LL and SA during walking, but LL correlated with SA during running (",10.1242/jeb.177949,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29622665/,Shock attenuation in the human lumbar spine during walking and running,"ABSTRACT During locomotion, each step generates a shock wave that travels through the body toward the head.

577,A crayfish molar tooth protein with putative mineralized exoskeletal chitinous matrix properties.,"Some crustaceans possess exoskeletons that are reinforced with calcium carbonate. In the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, the molar tooth, which is part of the mandibular exoskeleton, contains an unusual crystalline enamel-like apatite layer. As this layer resembles vertebrate enamel in composition and function, it offers an interesting example of convergent evolution. Unlike other parts of the crayfish exoskeleton, which is periodically shed and regenerated during the molt cycle, molar mineral deposition takes place during the pre-molt stage. The molar mineral composition transforms continuously from fluorapatite through amorphous calcium phosphate to amorphous calcium carbonate and is mounted on chitin. The process of crayfish molar formation is entirely extracellular and presumably controlled by proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, low-molecular weight molecules and calcium salts. We have identified a novel molar protein termed Cq-M15 from C. quadricarinatus and cloned its transcript from the molar-forming epithelium. Its transcript and differential expression were confirmed by a next-generation sequencing library. The predicted acidic pI of Cq-M15 suggests its possible involvement in mineral arrangement. Cq-M15 is expressed in several exoskeletal tissues at pre-molt and its silencing is lethal. Like other arthropod cuticular proteins, Cq-M15 possesses a chitin-binding Rebers-Riddiford domain, with a recombinant version of the protein found to bind chitin. Cq-M15 was also found to interact with calcium ions in a concentration-dependent manner. This latter property might make Cq-M15 useful for bone and dental regenerative efforts.

578,Temperature-induced maternal effects and environmental predictability.,"Maternal effects could influence the persistence of species under environmental change, but the adaptive significance of many empirically estimated maternal effects remains unclear. Inferences about the adaptive significance of maternal effects depend on the correlation between maternal and offspring environments, the relative importance of frequency- or density-dependent selection and whether absolute or relative fitness measures are used. Here, we combine the monitoring of the environment over time with a factorial experiment where we manipulated both the maternal and offspring environment in a marine bryozoan (Bugula neritina). We focused on temperature as our environmental variable as temperature commonly varies over short time scales in nature. We found that offspring from mothers kept in warmer water were smaller and more variable in size, but had increased dispersal potential and higher metamorphic success than offspring from mothers kept in cooler water. Our results suggest that, under frequency- or density-independent selection, mothers that experienced higher temperatures compared with lower temperatures were favoured. Under frequency- or density-dependent selection, there were indications that mothers that experienced higher temperatures would be favoured only if their offspring encountered similar (warmer) temperatures, though these results were not statistically significant. Analysis of time series data on temperature in the field shows that the maternal thermal environment is a good predictor of the temperatures offspring are likely to experience early in life.

Using a novel polarization projection system, we recently demonstrated that P. xuthus can detect visual motion based on polarization contrast. In the present study, we attempt to infer via behavioural experiments the mechanism underlying this polarization-based motion vision. Papilio xuthus do not perceive contrast between unpolarized and diagonally polarized light, implying that they cannot unambiguously estimate angle and degree of polarization, at least as far as motion detection is concerned. Furthermore, they conflate brightness and polarization cues, such that bright vertically polarized light resembles dim unpolarized light. These observations are consistent with a one-channel ‘monopolatic’ detector mechanism. We extend our existing model of motion vision in P. xuthus to incorporate these polarization findings, and conclude that the photoreceptors likely to form the basis for the putative monopolatic polarization detector are R3 and R4, which respond maximally to horizontally polarized green light. R5–R8, we propose, form a polarization-insensitive secondary channel tuned to longer wavelengths of light. Consistent with this account, we see greater sensitivity to polarization for green-light stimuli than for subjectively equiluminant red ones. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our model predicts greatest sensitivity to vertically polarized light; owing to the non-linearity of photoreceptor responses, light polarized to an angle orthogonal to a monopolatic detector's orientation offers the greatest contrast with unpolarized light.

During moult, males fed the enhanced diet were in better condition but there was no difference in humoral response between the dietary groups. T males produced a greater humoral antibody response than control (C) males. In the spring, males that had been previously treated with high T again exhibited higher antibody responses than C males. High T levels during moult were associated with a low PHA response but only in males with low body mass: heavier males that had high T exhibited the highest PHA responses.

583,Beta3-adrenoceptor in the eel (Anguilla anguilla) heart: negative inotropy and NO-cGMP-dependent mechanism.,"Neuroendocrine regulation of cardiac function involves a population of three types of beta-adrenoceptors (ARs). In various mammalian species, beta1- and beta2-AR stimulation produces an increase in contractility; whereas beta3-AR activation mediates negative inotropic effects. At the moment, nothing is known about the physiological role of beta3-AR in fish. Using an isolated working heart preparation, we show that a beta3-AR selective agonist BRL(37344) (0.1-100 nmol l(-1)) elicits a dose-dependent negative inotropism in the freshwater eel Anguilla anguilla. This effect was insensitive to the beta1/beta2-AR inhibitor nadolol (10 mumol l(-1)), but was blocked by the beta3-AR-specific antagonist SR(59230) (10 nmol l(-1)). The analysis of the percentage of stroke work (SW) variations, in terms of EC(50) values, induced by BRL(37344) alone (10 nmol l(-1)), and in presence of SR(59230) (10 nmol l(-1)), indicated a competitive antagonism of SR(59230). In addition to the classic positive inotropism, the non-specific beta agonist isoproterenol (100 nmol l(-1)) induced, in 30% of the preparations, a negative inotropic effect that was abrogated by pre-treatment with SR(59230), pointing to a beta3-mediated pathway. The BRL(37344)-induced negative inotropic effect was abolished by exposure to a G(i/o) proteins inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx; 0.01 nmol l(-1)), suggesting a G(i/o)-dependent mechanism. Using L-N5(l-imino-ethyl)ornithine (L-NIO; 10 mumol l(-1)), as a nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) blocker and haemoglobin (Hb; 1 mumol l(-1)), as a NO scavenger, we demonstrated that NO signalling is involved in the BRL(37344)-induced response. Pre-treatment with either an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 mumol l(-1)), or an inhibitor of the cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG) KT(5823) (100 nmol l(-1)), abolished the beta3-dependent negative inotropism, indicating the cGMP-PKG component as a crucial target of NO signalling.

In addition to the classic positive inotropism, the non-specific β agonist isoproterenol (100 nmol l-1) induced, in 30% of the preparations, a negative inotropic effect that was abrogated by pre-treatment with SR59230, pointing to a β3-mediated pathway. The BRL37344-induced negative inotropic effect was abolished by exposure to a Gi/o proteins inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTx; 0.01 nmol l-1), suggesting a Gi/o-dependent mechanism. Using L-N5(l-imino-ethyl)ornithine (L-NIO; 10 μmol l-1), as a nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) blocker and haemoglobin (Hb; 1 μmol l-1), as a NO scavenger, we demonstrated that NO signalling is involved in the BRL37344-induced response. Pre-treatment with either an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (GC) 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 μmol l-1), or an inhibitor of the cGMP-activated protein kinase (PKG) KT5823 (100 nmol l-1), abolished the β3-dependent negative inotropism, indicating the cGMP-PKG component as a crucial target of NO signalling.

584,Ceramide counteracts the effects of ghrelin on the metabolic control of food intake in rainbow trout.,"In mammals, ceramides are involved in the modulation of the orexigenic effects of ghrelin (GHRL). We previously demonstrated in rainbow trout that intracerebroventricular (ICV) treatment with ceramide (2.5 µg/100 g fish) resulted in an anorexigenic response, i.e. a response opposed to that described in mammals, where ceramide treatment is orexigenic. Therefore, we hypothesized that the putative interaction between GHRL and ceramide must be different in fish. Accordingly, in a first experiment, we observed that ceramide levels in the hypothalamus of rainbow trout did not change after ICV treatment with GHRL. In a second experiment, we assessed whether the effects of GHRL treatment on the regulation of food intake in rainbow trout changed in the presence of ceramide. Thus, we injected ICV GHRL and ceramide alone or in combination to evaluate in hypothalamus and hindbrain changes in parameters related to the metabolic control of food intake.

During the transition to ex ovo life, thyroid hormone levels naturally increase, peaking at hatching, and then decline. To better understand the role of the natural increase in thyroid hormone at hatching in regulating the developmental trajectory of the Pekin duck's endothermic phenotype, we examined development of O2 consumption (V̇O2) and ventilation (frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation) while inhibiting the developmental increase in thyroid hormones that occurs at hatching via administration of the thyroid-peroxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI) or accelerating the developmental increase via triiodothyronine (T3) supplementation. Animals were dosed only on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period and studied on incubation day 25, during external pipping (EP) and 1 day post-hatching (dph). On day 25, there was an increase in V̇O2 in the hyperthyroid treatment compared with the other two treatments. During the EP stage, there was a significant effect of thyroid status on V̇O2, with hyperthyroid V̇O2 being highest and hypothyroid V̇O2 the lowest. By 1 dph, the supplemented T3 and control animals had similar V̇O2 responses to cooling with comparable thermal neutral zones followed by increased V̇O2. Hypothyroid 1 dph hatchlings had a lower resting V̇O2 that did not increase to the same extent as the supplemented T3 and control animals during cooling. During EP, inhibiting the rise in T3 resulted in embryos with lower ventilation frequency and tidal volume than control and supplemented T3 embryos. At 1 dph, ventilation frequency of all animals increased during cooling, but tidal volume only increased in supplemented T3 and control hatchlings. Our data support the role of the late incubation increase in T3 in regulating the systemic development of endothermic metabolic capacity and associated control of ventilation occurring at hatching of the Pekin duck.

Particular attention was given to the cryptic species pair Lottia digitalis (northern occurring) and L. austrodigitalis (southern occurring) because of recent contraction in the southern range of L. digitalis and a northward range extension of L. austrodigitalis. As an index of adaptation of function, we measured the effects of temperature on the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) of the cofactor NADH (K(m)(NADH)). K(m)(NADH) values of cMDHs from the mid- to high-intertidal, low-latitude species L. scabra and L. gigantea were less sensitive to high temperature than those of cMDHs from the low- and mid-intertidal, high-latitude species L. scutum and L. pelta. cMDH of L. digitalis was more sensitive to high temperatures than the cMDH ortholog of L. austrodigitalis. Thermal stability (rate of loss of activity at 42.5 degrees C) showed a similar pattern of interspecific variation.

589,Colour vision and response bias in a coral reef fish.,"Animals use coloured signals for a variety of communication purposes, including to attract potential mates, recognize individuals, defend territories and warn predators of secondary defences (aposematism). To understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution and design of such visual signals, it is important to understand the visual systems and potential response biases of signal receivers. Here, we provide raw data on the spectral capabilities of a coral reef fish, the Picasso triggerfish Rhinecanthus aculeatus, which is potentially trichromatic with three cone sensitivities of 413 nm (single cone), 480 nm (double cone, medium sensitivity) and 528 nm (double cone, long sensitivity), and a rod sensitivity of 498 nm. The ocular media have a 50% transmission cut off at 405 nm. Behavioural experiments confirmed colour vision over their spectral range; triggerfish were significantly more likely to choose coloured stimuli over grey distractors, irrespective of luminance. We then examined whether response biases existed towards coloured and patterned stimuli to provide insight into how visual signals - in particular, aposematic colouration - may evolve. Triggerfish showed a preferential foraging response bias to red and green stimuli, in contrast to blue and yellow, irrespective of pattern. There was no response bias to patterned over monochromatic non-patterned stimuli. A foraging response bias towards red in fish differs from that of avian predators, who often avoid red food items.

590,The coding loci of evolution and domestication: current knowledge and implications for bio-inspired genome editing.,"One promising application of CRISPR/Cas9 is to create targeted mutations to introduce traits of interest into domesticated organisms. However, a major current limitation for crop and livestock improvement is to identify the precise genes and genetic changes that must be engineered to obtain traits of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages of bio-inspired genome editing, i.e. the engineered introduction of natural mutations that have already been associated with traits of interest in other lineages (breeds, populations or species). To obtain a landscape view of potential targets for genome editing, we used Gephebase (www.gephebase.org), a manually curated database compiling published data about the genes responsible for evolutionary and domesticated changes across eukaryotes, and examined the >1200 mutations that have been identified in the coding regions of more than 700 genes in animals, plants and yeasts. We observe that our genetic knowledge is relatively important for certain traits, such as xenobiotic resistance, and poor for others. We also note that protein-null alleles, often owing to nonsense and frameshift mutations, represent a large fraction of the known loci of domestication (42% of identified coding mutations), compared with intraspecific (27%) and interspecific evolution (11%).

Two species were studied, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus). Each fish underwent an incremental swim test to determine gait transition speed (UGT), where it first engaged the unsteady anaerobic swimming mode that preceded fatigue. After suitable recovery, each fish was exercised at 85% of their own UGT and warmed 1°C every 30 min, to identify the temperature at which they fatigued, denoted as CTswim. Fish were also submitted to a standard CTmax, warming at the same rate as CTswim, under static conditions until LOE. All individuals fatigued in CTswim, at a mean temperature approximately 2°C lower than their CTmax. Therefore, if exposed to acute warming in the wild, the ability to perform aerobic metabolic work would be constrained at temperatures significantly below those that directly threatened survival. The collapse in performance at CTswim was preceded by a gait transition qualitatively indistinguishable from that during the incremental swim test. This suggests that fatigue in CTswim was linked to an inability to meet the tissue oxygen demands of exercise plus warming. This is consistent with the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis, regarding the mechanism underlying tolerance of warming in fishes. Overall, fatigue at CTswim provides an ecologically relevant sub-lethal threshold that is more sensitive to extreme events than LOE at CTmax.

592,Excitatory actions of GABA mediate severe-hypoxia-induced depression of neuronal activity in the pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis).,"To characterize the effect of severe hypoxia on neuronal activity, long-term intracellular recordings were made from neurones in the isolated central ring ganglia of Lymnaea stagnalis.

Blocking GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission with the antagonist bicuculline methiodide (100 micromol l(-1)) decreased neuronal activity by 36%, and prevented any further changes in response to severe hypoxia, indicating that GABAergic neurotransmission mediates the severe hypoxia-induced decrease in neuronal activity. Puffing 100 micromol l(-1) GABA onto the cell body produced an excitatory response characterized by a transient increase in action potential (AP) firing, which was significantly decreased in severe hypoxia.

593,Mitochondrial physiology and reactive oxygen species production are altered by hypoxia acclimation in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus).,"Many fish encounter hypoxia in their native environment, but the role of mitochondrial physiology in hypoxia acclimation and hypoxia tolerance is poorly understood.

595,Not all sugars are created equal: some mask aversive tastes better than others in an herbivorous insect.,"Manduca sexta caterpillars are unusual because they exhibit strong peripheral gustatory responses to sugars, but nevertheless fail to show immediate appetitive responses to them. We hypothesized that the primary function of the peripheral gustatory response to sugars is to mask the taste of noxious compounds, which abound in host plants of M. sexta. We compared 10 s biting responses to water with those to mixtures of a noxious compound [caffeine (Caf) or aristolochic acid (AA)] and various combinations of sugars [i.e. sucrose (Suc), glucose (Glu), inositol (Ino), Suc+Glu, Suc+Ino or Glu+Ino]. The biting assays indicated that the aversive taste of AA was completely masked by Suc+Ino, and partially masked by Suc+Glu, Glu+Ino and Suc, whereas that of Caf was completely masked by Suc+Ino and Suc+Glu, and partially masked by Glu+Ino, Suc and Ino. To examine the contribution of the peripheral taste system to the masking phenomenon, we recorded responses of the maxillary gustatory sensilla to each stimulus mixture. The sugars differed greatly in their capacity to suppress peripheral gustatory responses to AA and Caf: Suc+Ino and Suc+Glu produced the greatest suppression, and Glu and Ino the least. Further, the extent to which each sugar stimulus suppressed the peripheral gustatory responses to AA reliably predicted the extent to which it masked the taste of AA in biting assays; no such predictive relationship was observed for the sugar/Caf mixtures.

596,Expression analysis of the speech-related genes FoxP1 and FoxP2 and their relation to singing behavior in two songbird species.,"Humans and songbirds are among the rare animal groups that exhibit socially learned vocalizations: speech and song, respectively.

Notably, the transcription factors Forkhead box proteins 1 and 2 (FoxP1, FoxP2) exhibit similar expression patterns in the cortex and basal ganglia of humans and the zebra finch species of songbird, among other brain regions. Mutations in either gene are associated with language disorders in humans. Experimental knock-down of FoxP2 in the basal ganglia song control region Area X during song development leads to imprecise copying of tutor songs. Moreover, FoxP2 levels decrease naturally within Area X when zebra finches sing. Here, we examined neural expression patterns of FoxP1 and FoxP2 mRNA in adult Bengalese finches, a songbird species whose songs exhibit greater sequence complexity and increased reliance on audition for maintaining their quality.

DMI correlated positively with its content of crude protein and nitrogen-free extract. Independent of these effects, DMI further varied seasonally with a peak in autumn and a nadir in late winter. Fluctuations of DMI corresponded to the annual change in body condition, which decreased during winter while energy reserves were depleted, and increased during the fattening period. Gut passage time varied in the course of the year and was longer during winter when the diet was high in crude fibre.

598,Independent voluntary correction and savings in locomotor learning.,"Humans can acquire new walking patterns in many different ways. For example, we can change our gait voluntarily in response to instruction or adapt by sensing our movement errors. Here, we investigated how acquisition of a new walking pattern through simultaneous voluntary correction and adaptive learning affected the resulting motor memory of the learned pattern. We studied adaptation to split-belt treadmill walking with and without visual feedback of stepping patterns. As expected, visual feedback enabled faster acquisition of the new walking pattern. However, upon later re-exposure to the same split-belt perturbation, participants exhibited similar motor memories whether they had learned with or without visual feedback. Participants who received feedback did not re-engage the mechanism used to accelerate initial acquisition of the new walking pattern to similarly accelerate subsequent relearning. These findings reveal that voluntary correction neither benefits nor interferes with the ability to save a new walking pattern over time.",10.1242/jeb.181826,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29903840,Independent voluntary correction and savings in locomotor learning,"ABSTRACT Humans can acquire new walking patterns in many different ways.

However, upon later re-exposure to the same split-belt perturbation, participants exhibited similar motor memories whether they had learned with or without visual feedback. Participants who received feedback did not re-engage the mechanism used to accelerate initial acquisition of the new walking pattern to similarly accelerate subsequent relearning. These findings reveal that voluntary correction neither benefits nor interferes with the ability to save a new walking pattern over time.

599,"Cuticular plasticization in the tick, Amblyomma hebraeum (Acari: Ixodidae): possible roles of monoamines and cuticular pH.","The degree of plasticization of the alloscutal cuticle of a 'hard' (ixodid) tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, and a 'soft' (argasid) tick, Ornithodoros moubata, was assessed throughout the blood-feeding period. Cuticle viscosity was calculated from rate of creep of cuticle under constant load using a Maxwell model. Feeding-related plasticization (i.e. increased rate of extension under a constant load) occurred in A. hebraeum but not in O. moubata. Maxwell viscosity of unfed A. hebraeum cuticle was relatively high (approximately 720 GPa s) but was significantly lower in feeding ticks. Small partially fed ticks displayed a viscosity of approximately 108 GPa s. Still lower values (42 GPa s) were observed in the largest of the engorged ticks. Following cessation of feeding, there was a significant but limited reversal in viscosity back to approximately 100 GPa s. The water content of cuticle of unfed A. hebraeum (23.4% of wet mass) rose sharply after the onset of feeding and reached a plateau value of 34.0% at a fed/unfed weight ratio of 3 and beyond. Ixodid ticks lay down new endocuticle during the feeding period. The observed increase in cuticle hydration suggests that both old and new cuticles are hydrated during feeding. Monoamines may play an important role in controlling cuticle viscosity. Dopamine (DA) injected into partially fed A. hebraeum caused plasticization. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT), which induces plasticization in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, had no statistically significant effect on tick cuticle. Octopamine (OA) and tyramine both caused cuticle stiffening (i.e. opposed plasticization). This suggests a possible inhibitory effect but co-injection of OA with DA did not reduce DA-induced plasticization. The mechanism leading to plasticization of tick cuticle may involve a change in cuticular pH. The viscosity of tick cuticle loops was highest at pH 8.0 (389 GPa s) and fell precipitously in the acidic range to a low value of 2.2 GPa s at pH 5.5-5.7. A cuticular pH of approximately 6.5 would account for the lowest viscosity observed under physiological conditions (42.4 GPa s for large, day 0, engorged ticks). The V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A, was a potent inhibitor of DA-induced plasticization. These results are consistent with a model in which DA acts to cause plasticization through transport of H(+) ions into the cuticle. Measurement of cuticular ion (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+)) content did not suggest that plasticization is caused by any of these ions. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of cuticular plasticization in feeding A. hebraeum is related to hydration, and involves the transport of H(+) ions into the sub-cuticular space by cells in the hypodermis. Feeding-induced plasticization was not observed in the rapid feeding tick, O. moubata.",10.1242/jeb.044412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20675552/,"Cuticular plasticization in the tick, Amblyomma hebraeum (Acari: Ixodidae): possible roles of monoamines and cuticular pH","SUMMARY The degree of plasticization of the alloscutal cuticle of a ‘hard’ (ixodid) tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, and a ‘soft’ (argasid) tick, Ornithodoros moubata, was assessed throughout the blood-feeding period.

600,"Coordination of feeding, locomotor and visual systems in parrotfishes (Teleostei: Labridae).","Fishes require complex coordinated motions of the jaws, body and fins during feeding in order to successfully execute the strike or bite and then move away from the predation site. In conjunction with locomotor systems, sensory modalities guide coordinated feeding behavior, with vision playing an important role in many fishes. Although often studied separately, the locomotor, feeding and visual systems have not previously been examined together during fish feeding. To explore feeding coordination, we examined the kinematics of feeding behavior in two species of herbivorous parrotfish, Sparisoma radians and Scarus quoyi, which exhibit different single bite and repetitive bite strategies. Kinematic data on pectoral fin movements and body position show distinctive differences in strategies for the approach and post-strike motion between these species. Sparisoma and Scarus exhibited significant differences in the magnitude of jaw protrusion, time to maximum jaw protrusion, cranial elevation, and order of events in the feeding sequence. Oculomotor data show that both species orient the pupil forward and downward directed at the site of jaw contact until 100 ms before the bite, at which point the visual field is rotated laterally. Combinations of kinematic variables show repeated patterns of synchrony (onset and duration) for the approach to the food (distance, velocity, eye movement), prey capture (eye movement, jaw movement, fin movement) and post-capture maneuvering (fin movement, distance).

603,Ecologically relevant measures of tolerance to potentially lethal temperatures.,"The acute thermal tolerance of ectotherms has been measured in a variety of ways; these include assays where organisms are shifted abruptly to stressful temperatures and assays where organisms experience temperatures that are ramped more slowly to stressful levels. Ramping assays are thought to be more relevant to natural conditions where sudden abrupt shifts are unlikely to occur often, but it has been argued that thermal limits established under ramping conditions are underestimates of true thermal limits because stresses due to starvation and/or desiccation can arise under ramping. These confounding effects might also impact the variance and heritability of thermal tolerance. We argue here that ramping assays are useful in capturing aspects of ecological relevance even though there is potential for confounding effects of other stresses that can also influence thermal limits in nature. Moreover, we show that the levels of desiccation and starvation experienced by ectotherms in ramping assays will often be minor unless the assays involve small animals and last for many hours. Empirical data illustrate that the combined effects of food and humidity on thermal limits under ramping and sudden shifts to stressful conditions are unpredictable; in Drosophila melanogaster the presence of food decreased rather than increased thermal limits, whereas in Ceratitis capitata they had little impact. The literature provides examples where thermal limits are increased under ramping presumably because of the potential for physiological changes leading to acclimation. It is unclear whether heritabilities and population differentiation will necessarily be lower under ramping because of confounding effects. Although it is important to clearly define experimental methods, particularly when undertaking comparative assessments, and to understand potential confounding effects, thermotolerance assays based on ramping remain an important tool for understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change.

605,Head roll stabilisation in the nocturnal bull ant Myrmecia pyriformis: implications for visual navigation.,"Ant foragers are known to memorise visual scenes that allow them to repeatedly travel along idiosyncratic routes and to return to specific places. Guidance is provided by a comparison between visual memories and current views, which critically depends on how well the attitude of the visual system is controlled. Here we show that nocturnal bull ants stabilise their head to varying degrees against locomotion-induced body roll movements, and this ability decreases as light levels fall. There are always un-compensated head roll oscillations that match the frequency of the stride cycle. Head roll stabilisation involves both visual and non-visual cues as ants compensate for body roll in complete darkness and also respond with head roll movements when confronted with visual pattern oscillations. We show that imperfect head roll control degrades navigation-relevant visual information and discuss ways in which navigating ants may deal with this problem.",10.1242/jeb.134049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26994172/,Head roll stabilisation in the nocturnal bull ant Myrmecia pyriformis: implications for visual navigation,"ABSTRACT Ant foragers are known to memorise visual scenes that allow them to repeatedly travel along idiosyncratic routes and to return to specific places.

606,Expanding our horizons: central pattern generation in the context of complex activity sequences.,"Central pattern generators (CPGs) are central nervous system (CNS) networks that can generate coordinated output in the absence of patterned sensory input. For decades, this concept was applied almost exclusively to simple, innate, rhythmic movements with essentially identical cycles that repeat continually (e.g. respiration) or episodically (e.g. locomotion). But many natural movement sequences are not simple rhythms, as they include different elements in a complex order, and some involve learning. The concepts and experimental approaches of CPG research have also been applied to the neural control of complex movement sequences, such as birdsong, though this is not widely appreciated. Experimental approaches to the investigation of CPG networks, both for simple rhythms and for complex activity sequences, have shown that: (1) brief activation of the CPG elicits a long-lasting naturalistic activity sequence; (2) electrical stimulation of CPG elements alters the timing of subsequent cycles or sequence elements; and (3) warming or cooling CPG elements respectively speeds up or slows down the rhythm or sequence rate. The CPG concept has also been applied to the activity rhythms of populations of mammalian cortical neurons. CPG concepts and methods might further be applied to a variety of fixed action patterns typically used in courtship, rivalry, nest building and prey capture. These complex movements could be generated by CPGs within CPGs ('nested' CPGs). Stereotypical, non-motor, non-rhythmic neuronal activity sequences may also be generated by CPGs.

We experimentally tested this prediction by studying immune function in European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, flown in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we predicted that constitutive immune function decreases in response to training and, additionally, in response to immediate exercise. We compared constitutive immune function among three groups: (1) 'untrained' birds that were kept in cages and were not flown; (2) 'trained' birds that received flight training over a 15 day period and performed a 1-4 h continuous flight, after which they rested for 48 h before being sampled; and (3) 'post-flight' birds that differed from the 'trained' group only in being sampled immediately after the final flight. A bird in our trained group represents an individual during migration that has been resting between migratory flights for at least 2 days. A bird in our post-flight group represents an individual that has just completed a migratory flight and has not yet had time to recover. Three of our four indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination and lysis) showed the predicted decrease in immune function in the post-flight group, and two indicators (haptoglobin, agglutination) showed the predicted decreasing trend from the untrained to trained to post-flight group. Haptoglobin levels were negatively correlated with flight duration. No effect of training or flight was detected on leukocyte profiles.

610,Thermoregulatory strategy may shape immune investment in Drosophila melanogaster.,"As temperatures change, insects alter the amount of melanin in their cuticle to improve thermoregulation.

We detected significant differences in cricket escape performance throughout ontogeny. Escape performances were higher in juvenile crickets than older instars. Complementary behavioural measurements for escaping crickets suggest that these variations may be related to the lower predatory risk perceived by large adults than by juveniles. We expect that our analysis of size-refuge will also improve our understanding in the development of performance, given its importance in community and population ecology theories."
614,"Visual stimulus characteristics that elicit tracking and striking in the praying mantises Parasphendale affinis, Popa spurca and Sphodromantis lineola.","We tested three species of praying mantis, Parasphendale affinis, Popa spurca and Sphodromantis lineola, with computer-generated stimuli that differed in size, contrast, configuration and movement pattern to determine the effects of these parameters on visual tracking and striking behavior. Overall, black disks moving erratically against a white background were strong releasers of both behaviors. When stimulus presentation order was randomized by size, P. affinis and P. spurca struck at progressively higher rates as the stimuli enlarged up to 44 deg; S. lineola struck most at intermediate sized (10-20 deg) disks. When disks were size-ordered from small to large, P. affinis and S. lineola struck at the smaller disks at higher rates; however, when the order was reversed, the early appearance of large disks suppressed subsequent responses to the smaller disks. Stimulus order did not differentially affect the responses of P. spurca. All species responded at higher rates to black disks moving against a white background versus the reverse. However, only P. spurca and S. lineola responded at higher rates to relatively darker grey disks, only P. affinis responded to mottled grey disks moving against an identically patterned background, and only P. spurca struck more frequently in response to rectangular stimuli oriented parallel (versus orthogonal) to their direction of movement. In conjunction with data on other species, these results support the hypothesis that praying mantises recognize prey based on assessment of several category-specific, spatiotemporal features, e.g. size, contrast, speed, movement pattern and leading edge length.

615,An acquired distaste: sugar discrimination by the larval parasitoid Microplitis croceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is affected by prior sugar exposure.,"We examined gustatory responses of the larval parasitoid Microplitis croceipes to determine whether the adults discriminate among common sugars, including fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose, found in plants. When given single sugar solutions of sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose at concentrations of 0.008-2.0 mol l(-1), the estimated concentrations at which 50% of wasps initiated feeding ranged between 0.054 and 0.085 mol l(-1) for sucrose, glucose and fructose, which was significantly lower than for maltose. Wasps showed a strong decrease in feeding time for maltose or fructose following a brief exposure to other sugars, suggesting that wasps can distinguish maltose and fructose from the other sugars tested. The higher acceptance threshold and short feeding time in the case of maltose appears adaptive in light of the relatively poor nutritional quality of the sugar in the longevity trial. The pronounced feeding inhibition seen for fructose following exposure to other sugars is not linked with lower nutritional performance. This feeding inhibition was even seen in wasps that had fed on glucose at the lowest acceptance threshold (0.031 mol l(-1)) and persisted for 24 h.

617,Manakins can produce iridescent and bright feather colours without melanosomes.,"Males of many species often use colourful and conspicuous ornaments to attract females. Among these, male manakins (family: Pipridae) provide classic examples of sexual selection favouring the evolution of bright and colourful plumage coloration. The highly iridescent feather colours of birds are most commonly produced by the periodic arrangement of melanin-containing organelles (melanosomes) within barbules. Melanin increases the saturation of iridescent colours seen from optimal viewing angles by absorbing back-scattered light; however, this may reduce the wide-angle brightness of these signals, contributing to a dark background appearance. We examined the nanostructure of four manakin species (Lepidothrix isidorei, L. iris, L. nattereri and L. coeruleocapilla) to identify how they produce their bright plumage colours. Feather barbs of all four species were characterized by dense and fibrous internal spongy matrices that likely increase scattering of light within the barb. The iridescent, yet pale or whitish colours of L. iris and L. nattereri feathers were produced not by periodically arranged melanosomes within barbules, but by periodic matrices of air and β-keratin within barbs. Lepidothrix iris crown feathers were able to produce a dazzling display of colours with small shifts in viewing geometry, likely because of a periodic nanostructure, a flattened barb morphology and disorder at a microstructural level.

618,How zebrafish turn: analysis of pressure force dynamics and mechanical work.,"Whereas many fishes swim steadily, zebrafish regularly exhibit unsteady burst-and-coast swimming, which is characterized by repeated sequences of turns followed by gliding periods. Such a behavior offers the opportunity to investigate the hypothesis that negative mechanical work occurs in posterior regions of the body during early phases of the turn near the time of maximal body curvature. Here, we used a modified particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique to obtain high-resolution flow fields around the zebrafish body during turns. Using detailed swimming kinematics coupled with body surface pressure computations, we estimated fluid-structure interaction forces and the pattern of forces and torques along the body during turning. We then calculated the mechanical work done by each body segment. We used estimated patterns of positive and negative work along the body to evaluate the hypothesis (based on fish midline kinematics) that the posterior body region would experience predominantly negative work. Between 10% and 20% of the total mechanical work was done by the fluid on the body (negative work), and negative work was concentrated in the anterior and middle areas of the body, not along the caudal region. Energetic costs of turning were calculated by considering the sum of positive and negative work and were compared with previous metabolic estimates of turning energetics in fishes.

620,Genetically based low oxygen affinities of felid hemoglobins: lack of biochemical adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in the snow leopard.,"Genetically based modifications of hemoglobin (Hb) function that increase blood-O2 affinity are hallmarks of hypoxia adaptation in vertebrates.

This combination of features compromises the acclimatization capacity of blood-O2 affinity and has led to the hypothesis that felids have a restricted physiological niche breadth relative to other mammals. In seeming defiance of this conjecture, the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) has an extraordinarily broad elevational distribution and occurs at elevations above 6000 m in the Himalayas. Here, we characterized structural and functional variation of big cat Hbs and investigated molecular mechanisms of Hb adaptation and allosteric regulation that may contribute to the extreme hypoxia tolerance of the snow leopard. Experiments revealed that purified Hbs from snow leopard and African lion exhibited equally low O2 affinities and DPG sensitivities. Both properties are primarily attributable to a single amino acid substitution, β2His→Phe, which occurred in the common ancestor of Felidae.

621,Mechanisms for the functional differentiation of the propulsive and braking roles of the forelimbs and hindlimbs during quadrupedal walking in primates and felines.,"During quadrupedal walking in most animals, the forelimbs play a net braking role, whereas the hindlimbs are net propulsive. However, the mechanism by which this differentiation occurs remains unclear. Here, we test two models to explain this pattern using primates and felines: (1) the horizontal strut effect (in which limbs are modeled as independent struts), and (2) the linked strut model (in which limbs are modeled as linked struts with a center of mass in between). Video recordings were used to determine point of contact, timing of mid-stance, and limb protraction/retraction duration. Single-limb forces were used to calculate contact time, impulses and the proportion of the stride at which the braking-to-propulsive transition (BP) occurred for each limb. We found no association between the occurrence of the BP and mid-stance, little influence of protraction and retraction duration on the braking-propulsive function of a limb, and a causative relationship between vertical force distribution between limbs and the patterns of horizontal forces. These findings reject the horizontal strut effect, and provide some support for the linked strut model, although predictions were not perfectly matched. We suggest that the position of the center of mass relative to limb contact points is a very important, but not the only, factor driving functional differentiation of the braking and propulsive roles of the limbs in quadrupeds.

Here, we test two models to explain this pattern using primates and felines: (1) the horizontal strut effect (in which limbs are modeled as independent struts), and (2) the linked strut model (in which limbs are modeled as linked struts with a center of mass in between). Video recordings were used to determine point of contact, timing of mid-stance, and limb protraction/retraction duration. Single-limb forces were used to calculate contact time, impulses and the proportion of the stride at which the braking-to-propulsive transition (BP) occurred for each limb. We found no association between the occurrence of the BP and mid-stance, little influence of protraction and retraction duration on the braking–propulsive function of a limb, and a causative relationship between vertical force distribution between limbs and the patterns of horizontal forces. These findings reject the horizontal strut effect, and provide some support for the linked strut model, although predictions were not perfectly matched. We suggest that the position of the center of mass relative to limb contact points is a very important, but not the only, factor driving functional differentiation of the braking and propulsive roles of the limbs in quadrupeds.

622,Exclusive localization of carbonic anhydrase in bacteriocytes of the deep-sea clam Calyptogena okutanii with thioautotrophic symbiotic bacteria.,"Deep-sea Calyptogena clams harbor thioautotrophic intracellular symbiotic bacteria in their gill epithelial cells. The symbiont fixes CO2 to synthesize organic compounds. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) from the host catalyzes the reaction CO2 + H2O ↔ HCO3(-) + H(+), and is assumed to facilitate inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake and transport to the symbiont. However, the localization of CA in gill tissue remains unknown. We therefore analyzed mRNA sequences, proteins and CA activity in Calyptogena okutanii using expression sequence tag, SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. We found that acetazolamide-sensitive soluble CA was abundantly expressed in the gill tissue of C. okutanii, and the enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the CA of C. okutanii were used in western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining of the gill tissues of C. okutanii, which showed that CA was exclusively localized in the symbiont-harboring cells (bacteriocytes) in gill epithelial cells. Western blot analysis and measurement of activity showed that CA was abundantly (26-72% of total soluble protein) detected in the gill tissues of not only Calyptogena clams but also deep-sea Bathymodiolus mussels that harbor thioautotrophic or methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria, but was not detected in a non-symbiotic mussel, Mytilus sp. The present study showed that CA is abundant in the gill tissues of deep-sea symbiotic bivalves and specifically localizes in the cytoplasm of bacteriocytes of C. okutanii.

623,Does the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship vary among geometrically similar birds of different mass?,"Based on aerodynamic considerations, the energy use-flight speed relationship of all airborne animals and aircraft should be U-shaped. However, measures of the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship in birds have been available since Tucker's pioneering experiments with budgerigars nearly forty years ago, but this classic work remains the only study to have found a clearly U-shaped metabolic power curve. The available data suggests that the energetic requirements for flight within this species are unique, yet the metabolic power curve of the budgerigar is widely considered representative of birds in general. Given these conflicting results and the observation that the budgerigar's mass is less than 50% of the next smallest species to have been studied, we asked whether large and small birds have metabolic power curves of different shapes. To address this question we measured the rates of oxygen uptake and wingbeat kinematics in budgerigars and cockatiels flying within a variable-speed wind tunnel. These species are close phylogenetic relatives, have similar flight styles, wingbeat kinematics, and are geometrically similar but have body masses that differ by a factor of two. In contrast to our expectations, we found the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship of both species to be acutely U-shaped. We also found that neither budgerigars nor cockatiels used their normal intermittent flight style while wearing a respirometric mask. We conclude that species size differences alone do not explain the previously unique metabolic power curve of the budgerigar; however, due to the absence of comparable data we cannot evaluate whether the mask-related kinematic response we document influences the metabolic rate-flight speed relationship of these parrots, or whether the energetics of flight differ between this and other avian clades.",10.1242/jeb.02727,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337719/,Does the metabolic rate–flight speed relationship vary among geometrically similar birds of different mass?,"SUMMARY Based on aerodynamic considerations, the energy use–flight speed relationship of all airborne animals and aircraft should be U-shaped.

The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at -4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust Locusta migratoria. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH.

629,The hydrodynamic disturbances of two species of krill: implications for aggregation structure.,"Krill aggregations vary in size, krill density and uniformity depending on the species of krill. These aggregations may be structured to allow individuals to sense the hydrodynamic cues of neighboring krill or to avoid the flow fields of neighboring krill, which may increase drag forces on an individual krill. To determine the strength and location of the flow disturbance generated by krill, we used infrared particle image velocimetry measurements to analyze the flow field of free-swimming solitary specimens (Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica) and small, coordinated groups of three to six E. superba. Euphausia pacifica individuals possessed shorter body lengths, steeper body orientations relative to horizontal, slower swimming speeds and faster pleopod beat frequencies compared with E. superba. The downward-directed flow produced by E. pacifica has a smaller maximum velocity and smaller horizontal extent of the flow pattern compared with the flow produced by E. superba, which suggests that the flow disturbance is less persistent as a potential hydrodynamic cue for E. pacifica.

These aggregations may be structured to allow individuals to sense the hydrodynamic cues of neighboring krill or to avoid the flow fields of neighboring krill, which may increase drag forces on an individual krill. To determine the strength and location of the flow disturbance generated by krill, we used infrared particle image velocimetry measurements to analyze the flow field of free-swimming solitary specimens (Euphausia superba and Euphausia pacifica) and small, coordinated groups of three to six E. superba. Euphausia pacifica individuals possessed shorter body lengths, steeper body orientations relative to horizontal, slower swimming speeds and faster pleopod beat frequencies compared with E. superba.

630,A systems-level approach to understanding transcriptional regulation by p53 during mammalian hibernation.,"Presumably to conserve energy, many mammals enter into hibernation during the winter. Homeostatic processes such as transcription and translation are virtually arrested. To further elucidate transcriptional regulation during hibernation, we studied the transcription factor p53. Here, we demonstrate that changes in liver mRNA and protein concentrations of known regulators of p53 are consistent with activation. p53 mRNA and protein concentrations are unrelated. Importantly, p53 protein concentration is increased ~2-fold during the interbout arousal that punctuates bouts of torpor. As a result, both the interbout arousal and the torpid state are characterized by high levels of nuclear-localized p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate that p53 binds DNA during the winter. Furthermore, p53 recruits RNA polymerase II, as indicated by nuclear run-on data. However, and consistent with previous data indicating an arrest of transcriptional elongation during torpor, p53 'activity' does not result in expected changes in target gene transcripts. These data demonstrate the importance of using a systems level-approach in understanding a complex phenotype such as mammalian hibernation. Relying on interpretations of data that are based on steady-state regulation in other systems may be misleading in the context of non-steady-state conditions such as torpor.",10.1242/jeb.103614,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25031456/,A systems-level approach to understanding transcriptional regulation by p53 during mammalian hibernation,"Presumably to conserve energy, many mammals enter into hibernation during the winter.

631,Characterization of very-low density lipoprotein particle diameter dynamics in relation to egg production in a passerine bird.,"During avian egg production, oestrogen mediates marked increases in hepatic lipid production and changes in the diameter of assembled very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL). A nearly complete shift from generic VLDL ( approximately 70 nm in diameter), which transports lipids to peripheral tissues, to yolk-targeted VLDL (VLDLy) ( approximately 30 nm), which supplies the yolk with energy-rich lipid, has been observed in the plasma of laying domestic fowl. We validated an established dynamic laser scattering technique for a passerine songbird Taeniopygia guttata, the zebra finch, to characterize the dynamics of VLDL particle diameter distribution in relation to egg production. We predicted that non-gallinaceous avian species that have not been selected for maximum egg production would exhibit less dramatic shifts in lipid metabolism during egg production. As predicted, there was considerable overlap between the VLDL particle diameter distributions of laying and non-laying zebra finches. But unexpectedly, non-laying zebra finches had VLDL diameter distributions that peaked at small particles and had relatively few large VLDL particles. As a result, laying zebra finches, in comparison, had diameter distributions that were shifted towards larger VLDL particles. Nevertheless, laying zebra finches, like laying chickens, had larger proportions of particles within proposed VLDLy particle diameter ranges than non-laying zebra finches (e.g. sVLDLy: 50% vs 37%). Furthermore, zebra finches and chickens had similar modal (29.7 nm in both species) and median (32.7 nm vs 29.6 nm) VLDL particle diameters during egg production. Therefore, although zebra finches and chickens exhibited opposing directional shifts in VLDL particle diameter distribution during egg production, the modifications to VLDL particle structure in both species resulted in the realization of a common goal, i.e. to produce and maintain a large proportion of small VLDL particles of specific diameters that are capable of being incorporated into newly forming egg yolks.",10.1242/jeb.02724,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17337718/,Characterization of very-low density lipoprotein particle diameter dynamics in relation to egg production in a passerine bird,"SUMMARY During avian egg production, oestrogen mediates marked increases in hepatic lipid production and changes in the diameter of assembled very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL).

632,Coordination of cytochrome c oxidase gene expression in the remodelling of skeletal muscle.,"Many fish species respond to low temperature by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, reflected in an increase in activity of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX). COX is composed of 13 subunits, three encoded by mitochondrial (mt)DNA and 10 encoded by nuclear genes. We used real-time PCR to measure mRNA levels for the 10 nuclear-encoded genes that are highly expressed in muscle. We measured mRNA levels in white muscle of three minnow species, each at two temperatures: zebrafish (Danio rerio) acclimated to 11 and 30°C, goldfish (Carassius auratus) acclimated to 4 and 35°C, and northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos) collected in winter and summer. We hypothesized that temperature-induced changes in COX activity would be paralleled by COX nuclear-encoded subunit transcript abundance. However, we found mRNA for COX subunits showed pronounced differences in thermal responses. Though zebrafish COX activity did not change in the cold, the transcript levels of four subunits decreased significantly (COX5A1, 60% decrease; COX6A2, 70% decrease; COX6C, 50% decrease; COX7B, 55% decrease). Treatments induced changes in COX activity in both dace (2.9 times in winter fish) and goldfish (2.5 times in cold fish), but the response in transcript levels was highly variable. Some subunits failed to increase in one (goldfish COX7A2, dace COX6A2) or both (COX7B, COX6B2) species. Other transcripts increased 1.7-100 times. The most cold-responsive subunits were COX4-1 (7 and 21.3 times higher in dace and goldfish, respectively), COX5A1 (13.9 and 5 times higher), COX6B1 (6 and 10 times higher), COX6C (11 and 4 times higher) and COX7C (13.3 and 100 times higher). The subunits that most closely paralleled COX increases in the cold were COX5B2 (dace 2.5 times, goldfish 1.7 times) and COX6A2 (dace 4.1 times, goldfish 1.7 times).

633,The variable colours of the fiddler crab Uca vomeris and their relation to background and predation.,"Colour changes in fiddler crabs have long been noted, but a functional interpretation is still lacking. Here we report that neighbouring populations of Uca vomeris in Australia exhibit different degrees of carapace colours, which range from dull mottled to brilliant blue and white. We determined the spectral characteristics of the mud substratum and of the carapace colours of U. vomeris and found that the mottled colours of crabs are cryptic against this background, while display colours provide strong colour contrast for both birds and crabs, but luminance contrast only for a crab visual system. We tested whether crab populations may become cryptic under the influence of bird predation by counting birds overflying or feeding on differently coloured colonies. Colonies with cryptically coloured crabs indeed experience a much higher level of bird presence, compared to colourful colonies. We show in addition that colourful crab individuals subjected to dummy bird predation do change their body colouration over a matter of days.

634,To freeze or not to freeze: adaptations for overwintering by hatchlings of the North American painted turtle.,"Many physiologists believe that hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) provide a remarkable, and possibly unique, example of 'natural freeze-tolerance' in an amniotic vertebrate. However, the concept of natural freeze-tolerance in neonatal painted turtles is based on results from laboratory studies that were not placed in an appropriate ecological context, so the concept is suspect. Indeed, the weight of current evidence indicates that hatchlings overwintering in the field typically withstand exposure to ice and cold by avoiding freezing altogether and that they do so without benefit of an antifreeze to depress the equilibrium freezing point for bodily fluids. As autumn turns to winter, turtles remove active nucleating agents from bodily fluids (including bladder and gut), and their integument becomes a highly efficient barrier to the penetration of ice into body compartments from frozen soil. In the absence of a nucleating agent or a crystal of ice to 'catalyze' the transformation of water from liquid to solid, the bodily fluids remain in a supercooled, liquid state. The supercooled animals nonetheless face physiological challenges, most notably an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism as the circulatory system first is inhibited and then caused to shut down by declining temperature. Alterations in acid/base status resulting from the accumulation of lactic acid may limit survival by supercooled turtles, and sublethal accumulations of lactate may affect behavior of turtles after the ground thaws in the spring. The interactions among temperature, circulatory function, metabolism (both aerobic and anaerobic), acid/base balance and behavior are fertile areas for future research on hatchlings of this model species.",10.1242/jeb.01123,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277545/,To freeze or not to freeze: adaptations for overwintering by hatchlings of the North American painted turtle,"SUMMARY Many physiologists believe that hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) provide a remarkable, and possibly unique, example of `natural freeze-tolerance' in an amniotic vertebrate.

Similar variation of wingbeat frequency in hovering flight occurred among small to large species, and ranged from 250 to 86 Hz.
