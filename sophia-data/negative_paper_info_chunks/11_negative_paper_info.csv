Initially, transmission electron tomography (TEM tomography) was introduced to image the cell volume in semi-thin sections (∼ 500 nm). With the introduction of the focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, a new tool, FIB-SEM tomography, became available to image much larger volumes. During TEM tomography and FIB-SEM tomography, the resin section is exposed to a high electron/ion dose such that the stability of the resin embedded biological sample becomes an important issue. The shrinkage of a resin section in each dimension, especially in depth, is a well-known phenomenon. To ensure the dimensional integrity of the final volume of the cell, it is important to assess the properties of the different resins and determine the formulation which has the best stability in the electron/ion beam. Here, eight different resin formulations were examined. The effects of radiation damage were evaluated after different times of TEM irradiation. To get additional information on mass-loss and the physical properties of the resins (stiffness and adhesion), the topography of the irradiated areas was analysed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further, the behaviour of the resins was analysed after ion milling of the surface of the sample with different ion currents. In conclusion, two resin formulations, Hard Plus and the mixture of Durcupan/Epon, emerged that were considerably less affected and reasonably stable in the electron/ion beam and thus suitable for the 3-D investigation of biological samples.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We describe how the method, so far restricted to isolated small cells or cell monolayers, can be extended to large cells and tissue. We image the synapses of the Kenyon cells in frozen hydrated Drosophila brains combining cryo-soft X-ray microscopy of thick vitreous sections, and cryo-electron microscopy of ultrathin vitreous sections. We show how to obtain frozen hydrated sections of thicknesses ranging from 40 nm up to 2.5 μm, by tuning the sectioning speed of the cryo-microtome. A fluorescent stereo-microscope mounted on the cryo-microtome allowed us to target the regions of interest after GFP-labeling of synapses. Thick cryo-sections were imaged by cryo-soft X-ray microscopy at a resolution better than 25 nm, while ultrathin cryo-sections of the same regions were explored in parallel at the nanometre level of resolution by cryo-electron microscopy.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we describe a method for cryoprotection that uses vapor diffusion of volatile cryoprotective agents into loop-mounted crystals. The crystal is mounted into a vial containing a small volume of an alcohol-based cryosolution. After a short incubation with the looped crystal sitting in the cryosolution vapor, the crystal is transferred directly from the vial into the cooling medium. Effective for several different protein crystals, the approach obviates the need for liquid soaking and opens up a heretofore underutilized class of cryoprotective agents for macromolecular crystallography.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The goal of this study was to evaluate myelin content in histological images obtained from a lysolecithin mouse model of demyelination, using a new quantitative method named structure tensor analysis. Injury was targeted at the dorsal column of mice spinal cords. We obtained 16 histological images stained with luxol fast blue for myelin from 9 mice: 9 images from lesion epicenter and 7 from a distant area 500-μm away from the epicenter. In each image, we categorized 3 tissue types: healthy, completely demyelinated, and partially demyelinated. Structure tensor analysis was applied to quantify the coherency (anisotropy), energy (trace of dominant directions), and angular entropy (degree of disorder) of each tissue. We found that completely demyelinated lesions had significantly lower coherency and energy but higher angular entropy than partially demyelinated and healthy tissues at both the epicenter and distant areas of the injury. In addition, the coherency of healthy tissue was greater than partially demyelinated tissue at each site. Within tissue category, we did not find differences in any measure between spinal cord locations. Our findings suggest that greater myelin integrity is associated with better tissue anisotropy, independent of injury location. Structure tensor analysis may serve as a new tool for quantitative measurement of myelin content in white matter, and this may help understand disease mechanisms and development in MS and other demyelinating disorders.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To date, weighted back-projection (WBP) has been the most commonly used technique due to its versatility and performance in sub-tomogram averaging. Here we present super-sampling SART that is based on the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique. While algebraic reconstruction techniques typically produce better contrast and lately showed a significant improvement in terms of processing speed, sub-tomogram averages derived from those reconstructions were inferior in resolution compared to those derived from WBP data. Super-sampling SART, however, outperforms both in term of contrast and the resolution achieved in sub-tomogram averaging several other tested methods and in particular WBP. The main feature of super-sampling SART, as the name implies, is the super-sampling option - by which parameter-based up-sampling and down-sampling are used to reduce artifacts. In particular, the aliasing that is omnipresent in the reconstruction can be practically eliminated without a significant increase in the computational time. Furthermore, super-sampling SART reaches convergence within a single iteration, making the processing time comparable to WBP, and eliminating the ambiguity of parameter-controlled convergence times. We find that grouping of projections increases the contrast, while when projections are used individually the resolution can be maximized. Using sub-tomogram averaging of ribosomes as a test case, we show that super-sampling SART achieves equal or better sub-tomogram averaging results than WBP, which is of particular importance in cryo-electron tomography.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The development of direct detectors constitutes a revolution that has led to a wave of near-atomic resolution cryoEM reconstructions. However, regardless of the sample studied, virtually all high-resolution reconstructions reported to date have been achieved using high-end microscopes. We demonstrate that the new generation of direct detectors coupled to a widely used mid-range electron microscope also enables obtaining cryoEM maps of sufficient quality for de novo modeling of protein structures of different sizes and symmetries. We provide an outline of the strategy used to achieve a 3.7 Å resolution reconstruction of Nudaurelia capensis ω virus and a 4.2 Å resolution reconstruction of the Thermoplasma acidophilum T20S proteasome.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Owing to their regularity, coiled-coil structures can be fully described by parametric equations. This in turn makes them an excellent model for studying sequence-structure relationships in proteins. Here, we used computational design to identify sequence features that determine the degree of helix axial rotation in four-helical homo-oligomeric antiparallel coiled coils. We designed 135,000 artificial sequences for a repertoire of backbone models representing all theoretically possible axial rotation states. Analysis of the designed sequences revealed features that precisely define the rotation of the helices. Based on these features we implemented a bioinformatic tool, which given a coiled-coil sequence, predicts the rotation of the helices in its structure. Moreover, we showed that another structural parameter, helix axial shift, is coupled to helix axial rotation and that dependence between these two parameters narrows the number of possible axial rotation states.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A previously reported NMR-derived solution structure of the type-I dockerin module from Cel48S of Clostridium thermocellum, which utilized two-dimensional homonuclear (1)H-(1)H NOESY and three-dimensional (15)N-edited NOESY distance restraints, displayed substantial conformational differences from subsequent structures of dockerin modules in complex with their cognate cohesin modules, raising the question whether the source of the observed differences resulted from cohesin-induced structural rearrangements. Here, we determined the solution structure of the Cel48S type-I dockerin based on (15)N- and (13)C-edited NOESY-derived distance restraints. The structure adopted a fold similar to X-ray crystal structures of dockerin modules in complex with their cohesin partners. A unique cis-peptide bond between Leu-65 and Pro-66 in the Cel48S type-I dockerin module was also identified in the present structure. Our structural analysis of the Cel48S type-I dockerin module indicates that it does not undergo appreciable cohesin-induced structural alterations but rather assumes an inherent calcium-dependent cohesin-primed conformation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

HEMNMA was shown to be a good approach to analyze multiple conformations of a macromolecular complex but it could not be widely used in the EM field due to a lack of an integral interface. In particular, its use required switching among different software sources as well as selecting modes for image analysis was difficult without the graphical interface. The graphical interface was thus developed to simplify the practical use of HEMNMA. It is implemented in the open-source software package Xmipp 3.1 (http://xmipp.cnb.csic.es) and only a small part of it relies on MATLAB that is accessible through the main interface. Such integration provides the user with an easy way to perform the analysis of macromolecular dynamics and forms a direct connection to the single-particle reconstruction process. A step-by-step HEMNMA protocol with the graphical interface is given in full details in Supplementary material. The graphical interface will be useful to experimentalists who are interested in studies of continuous conformational changes of macromolecular complexes beyond the modeling of continuous heterogeneity in single particle reconstruction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we have examined the structural organization of sperm chromatin from representatives of three vertebrate lineages, bony fish (Danio rerio), birds (Gallus gallus domesticus) and mammals (Mus musculus) using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although the three sperm nuclei are all highly compact, they differ in morphology and in the complement of compaction-inducing proteins. Whereas zebrafish sperm retain somatic histones and a nucleosomal organization, in the rooster and mouse, histones are largely replaced by small, arginine-rich protamines. In contrast to the mouse, the rooster protamine contains no cysteine residues and lacks the potential stabilizing effects of S-S bonds. Protamine driven chromatin compaction results in a stable, highly condensed chromatin, markedly different from the somatic nucleosome-based beads-on-a-string architecture, but its structure remains poorly understood. When prepared gently for whole mount TEM, the rooster and mouse sperm chromatin reveal striking rod-like units 40-50 nm in width. Also present in the mouse, which has very flattened sperm nuclei, but not rooster, where nuclei take the form of elongated cylinders, are toroidal shaped structures, with an external diameter of about 90 nm. In contrast, similarly prepared zebrafish sperm exhibit nucleosomal chromatin. We also examined the early stages in the binding of salmine (the salmon protamine) to defined sequence DNA. These images suggest an initial side-by-side binding of linear DNA-protamine complexes leading to the nucleation of thin, flexible rods with the potential to bend, allowing the ends to come into contact and fuse to form toroidal structures. We discuss the relationship between these in vitro observations and the rods and toroids seen in nuclei, and suggest an explanation for the apparent absence of these structures in TEM images of fully condensed sperm nuclei.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous evidence linked this protein to cell wall metabolism and sensitivity to β-lactams. We describe here the crystal structure of Rv2525c that shows a TIM barrel-like fold characteristic of glycoside hydrolases of the GH25 family, which includes prokaryotic and phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases. Structural comparison with other members of this family combined with substrate docking suggest that, although the 'neighbouring group' catalytic mechanism proposed for this family still appears as the most plausible, the identity of residues involved in catalysis in GH25 hydrolases might need to be revised.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We studied the cuticle of the PI of Porcellio scaber in order to understand region-dependent differences in its ultrastructure, composition, and the resulting mechanical properties, employing several microscopic and analytical techniques as well as nanoindentation experiments. The cuticle of the incisive tip is not mineralized and consists of an unusually thick epicuticle containing thin fibrils, two subjacent cuticular layers, and a central core containing fibrils of different orientation, either longitudinal or circumferential. A thick epicuticle of the middle region just behind the tip projects long epicuticular extensions into the subjacent endocuticle, likely to prevent delamination. A distinct exocuticular layer is lacking in the middle region. Most chitin-protein fibrils within the endocuticle are oriented in parallel pointing towards the tip. Surprisingly, the middle region is mineralized by amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) only. Near the base, ACP is successively replaced by amorphous calcium carbonate and calcite is restricted to a distal layer in the base. At the transition between middle and base, the epicuticle forms a hybrid material containing fibrils of the exocuticle. Nanoindentation experiments reveal an increase of the stiffness and hardness from the tip towards the base and significantly higher values on transversal in comparison to longitudinal planes. The results suggest that ultrastructure and composition are adapted for conveying high forces from a rather thin cutting edge to the stable base of the PI.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

PhoU is a negative regulator of the Pi-signaling pathway and modulates Pi transport through Pi transporter proteins (PstS, PstC, PstA, and PstB) through the two-component system PhoR and PhoB. Inactivation of PhoY2, one of the two PhoU homologs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes defects in persistence phenotypes and increased susceptibility to antibiotics and stresses. Despite the important biological role, the mechanism of PhoU function is still unknown. Here we have determined the crystal structure of PhoU from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It exists as a dimer in the crystal, with each monomer consisting of two structurally similar three-helix bundles. Our equilibrium sedimentation measurements support the reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium model in which P. aeruginosa PhoU exists in solution predominantly as dimers, with monomers in a minor fraction, at low protein concentrations. The dissociation constant for PhoU dimerization is 3.2×10(-6)M. The overall structure of P. aeruginosa PhoU dimer resembles those of Aquifex aeolicus PhoU and Thermotoga maritima PhoU2.

Here, we provide evidence for the emergence of this enzyme from a TRASH-like, non-enzymatic, treble-clef zinc finger ancestor by domain duplication and fusion. Surprisingly, the structure-stabilizing metal-binding core of the treble-clef appears to have been repurposed in evolution to serve a catalytic role. Novel enzymatic functions are believed to have evolved from ancestral generalist catalytic scaffolds or from already specialized enzymes with catalytic promiscuity.

The helical structures of nanoscale proteins are principally determined by three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from electron micrographs. However, bending or distortion of flexible helices and the low contrast of the images recorded by cryo-electron microscopy, prevent the analysis from reaching high resolution. We have developed a novel helical reconstruction method that overcomes these issues, and present the processing of microtubule images to demonstrate its application. Cropping long helical structures into small square pieces allows bending or distortion of the helices to be accounted for. The initial image-frames are automatically positioned assuming perfect helical symmetry. A simulated annealing (SA)-based algorithm is then used to adjust the framing. This is guided by the contrast of 2D averages, which serve as an accuracy index. After the initial 3D reconstruction, the position and orientation of each average image is iteratively adjusted to give the best match between the input average and the reprojection from the reconstruction. Finally, reconstructions from images recorded at different defocus values, are aligned and averaged to compensate the contrast transfer modulation and improve the resolution. The method successfully determined the structure of a 15-protofilament microtubule. The 8.8Å resolution (7.8Å using the 0.143 FSC criterion) attained allows differences between the α- and β- tubulins to be discerned in the absence of a molecular landmark such as microtubule-associated proteins, for the first time by electron microscopy.

Future projections indicate under saturation of aragonite, and potentially calcite, in the oceans by 2100. Calcifying organisms are those most at risk from such ocean acidification, as carbonate is vital in the biomineralisation of their calcium carbonate protective shells. This study highlights the importance of multi-generational studies to investigate how marine organisms can potentially adapt to future projected global climate change. Mytilus edulis is an economically important marine calcifier vulnerable to decreasing carbonate saturation as their shells comprise two calcium carbonate polymorphs: aragonite and calcite. M. edulis specimens were cultured under current and projected pCO2 (380, 550, 750 and 1000μatm), following 6months of experimental culture, adults produced second generation juvenile mussels. Juvenile mussel shells were examined for structural and crystallographic orientation of aragonite and calcite. At 1000μatm pCO2, juvenile mussels spawned and grown under this high pCO2 do not produce aragonite which is more vulnerable to carbonate under-saturation than calcite. Calcite and aragonite were produced at 380, 550 and 750μatm pCO2. Electron back scatter diffraction analyses reveal less constraint in crystallographic orientation with increased pCO2. Shell formation is maintained, although the nacre crystals appear corroded and crystals are not so closely layered together. The differences in ultrastructure and crystallography in shells formed by juveniles spawned from adults in high pCO2 conditions may prove instrumental in their ability to survive ocean acidification.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Application of electron cryo-microscopy and structural modeling of the bovine endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) holoenzyme produced detailed models of the intact holoenzyme in the presence and absence of Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM). These models accommodate the cross-electron transfer from the reductase in one monomer to the heme in the opposite monomer. The heme domain acts as the anchoring dimeric structure for the entire enzyme molecule, while the FMN domain is activated by CaM to move flexibly to bridge the distance between the reductase and oxygenase domains.

We used high resolution synchrotron X-ray phase contrast micro-tomography in a novel approach to visualise gas films on submerged leaves of common cordgrass (Spartina anglica). 3D tomograms enabled a hitherto unmatched level of detail regarding the micro-topography of leaf gas films. Gas films formed only on the superhydrophobic adaxial leaf side (water droplet contact angle, Φ=162°) but not on the abaxial side (Φ=135°). The adaxial side of the leaves of common cordgrass is plicate with a longitudinal system of parallel grooves and ridges and the vast majority of the gas film volume was found in large ∼180μm deep elongated triangular volumes in the grooves and these volumes were connected to each neighbouring groove via a fine network of gas tubules (∼1.7μm diameter) across the ridges. In addition to the gas film retained on the leaf exterior, the X-ray phase contrast micro-tomography also successfully distinguished gas spaces internally in the leaf tissues, and the tissue porosity (gas volume per unit tissue volume) ranged from 6.3% to 20.3% in tip and base leaf segments, respectively. We conclude that X-ray phase contrast micro-tomography is a powerful tool to obtain quantitative data of exterior gas features on biological samples because of the significant difference in electron density between air, biological tissues and water.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

An alternative is to express them in insect cells. Labeled insect cell growth media are commercially available but at prohibitive prices, limiting the NMR studies to only a subset of biologically important proteins. Non-commercial solutions from academic institutions have been proposed, but none of them is really satisfying. We have developed a (15)N-labeling procedure based on the use of a commercial medium depleted of all amino acids and supplemented with a (15)N-labeled yeast autolysate for a total cost about five times lower than that of the currently available solutions. We have applied our procedure to the production of a non-polymerizable mutant of actin in Sf9 cells and of fragments of eukaryotic and viral membrane fusion proteins in S2 cells, which typically cannot be produced in E. coli, with production yields comparable to those obtained with standard commercial media.

Using a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope, we created nanoscale resolution serial images to quantify the three-dimensional ultrastructure of a human left ventricular myocyte. Transverse tubules (t-tubule), lipid droplets, A-bands, and mitochondria occupy 1.8, 1.9, 10.8, and 27.9% of the myocyte volume, respectively. The complex t-tubule system has a small tortuosity (1.04±0.01), and is composed of long transverse segments with diameters of 317±24nm and short branches. Our data indicates that lipid droplets located well beneath the sarcolemma are proximal to t-tubules, where 59% (13 of 22) of lipid droplet centroids are within 0.50μm of a t-tubule. This spatial association could have an important implication in the development and treatment of heart failure because it connects two independently known pathophysiological alterations, a substrate switch from fatty acids to glucose and t-tubular derangement.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Upon activation by an agonist, GPCRs undergo large-scale conformational changes that enable binding of the G protein to the receptor. A key open question concerns the mechanism of the long-distance coupling between the agonist-binding site and the cytoplasmic site where G protein binds. Here we address this question by exploring the molecular dynamics of bovine opsin bound to three different fragments of G-proteins. We find that an extended network of hydrogen bonds connects the agonist retinal binding site to the G protein binding site via conserved amino acid residues. The dynamics of the hydrogen-bonding network inside opsin couples to interactions at the G protein binding site.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzymes follow sequential order 'bi-bi' reaction kinetics. The mechanistic study of a SDR homolog, reductase (R) domain, from multifunctional enzymes, e.g. Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPSs) and Polyketide Synthases (PKSs) has revealed that it reductively releases 4'-phosphopantetheinyl arm-tethered peptidyl product. We report that the R-domains of NRPSs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (RNRP) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (RGPL) do not strictly adhere to the obligatory mode of catalysis performed by SDRs, but instead can carry out reductive catalysis of substrate following random bi-bi reaction mechanism as deciphered by NMR and SAXS studies. The crucial conformational change associated with NADPH binding necessary to achieve catalytically competent conformation is also delineated by SAXS studies. Using ITC, we have demonstrated that mutation of catalytic tyrosine to phenylalanine in R-domains results in 3-4-fold decrease in affinity for NADPH and attribute this phenomenon to loss of the noncovalent cation-π interactions present between the tyrosine and nicotinamide ring. We propose that the adaptation to an alternative theme of bi-bi catalytic mechanism enables the R-domains to process the substrates transferred by upstream domains and maintain assembly-line enzymology.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their high versatility makes them excellent candidates for biotechnological purposes. Sterol esterase from fungus Ophiostoma piceae (OPE) belongs to the family abH03.01 of the Candida rugosa lipase-like proteins. Crystal structures of OPE were solved in this study for the closed and open conformations. Enzyme activation involves a large displacement of the conserved lid, structural rearrangements of loop α16-α17, and formation of a dimer with a large opening. Three PEG molecules are placed in the active site, mimicking chains of the triglyceride substrate, demonstrating the position of the oxyanion hole and the three pockets that accommodate the sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3 fatty acids chains. One of them is an internal tunnel, connecting the active center with the outer surface of the enzyme 30 Å far from the catalytic Ser220.

It is one of the most abundant proteins in kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), and has been shown to be recognised by IgE of some patients allergic to kiwifruit. Cleavage of kiwellin into an N-terminal 4 kDa peptide called kissper and a core domain called KiTH is mediated by actinidin in vitro, and isolation of the kissper peptide from green-fleshed kiwifruit extracts suggested it may result from in vivo processing of kiwellin. In solution, kissper is highly flexible and displays pore-forming activity in synthetic lipid-bilayers. We present here the 2.05 Å resolution crystal structure of full-length kiwellin, purified from its native source, Actinidia chinensis (gold-fleshed kiwifruit). The structure confirms the modularity of the protein and the intrinsic flexibility of kissper and reveals that KiTH harbours a double-psi β-barrel fold hooked to an N-terminal β hairpin.

The T2SS consists of 11-15 different proteins most of which are present in multiple copies in the assembled secretion machinery. The ATPase GspE, essential for the functioning of the T2SS, contains three domains (N1E, N2E and CTE) of which the N1E domain is associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the inner membrane protein GspL. Here we describe and analyze the structure of the GspE•cyto-GspL complex from Vibrio vulnificus in the presence of an ATP analog, AMPPNP. There are three such ∼83 kDa complexes per asymmetric unit with essentially the same structure. The N2E and CTE domains of a single V. vulnificus GspE subunit adopt a mutual orientation that has not been seen before in any of the previous GspE structures, neither in structures of related ATPases from other secretion systems. This underlines the tremendous conformational flexibility of the T2SS secretion ATPase. Cyto-GspL interacts not only with the N1E domain, but also with the CTE domain and is even in contact with AMPPNP. Moreover, the cyto-GspL domains engage in two types of mutual interactions, resulting in two essentially identical, but crystallographically independent, ""cyto-GspL rods"" that run throughout the crystal. Very similar rods are present in previous crystals of cyto-GspL and of the N1E•cyto-GspL complex. This arrangement, now seen four times in three entirely different crystal forms, involves contacts between highly conserved residues suggesting a role in the biogenesis or the secretion mechanism or both of the T2SS.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Calpain-I is a Ca(2+)-dependent protease that plays a key role in the extravasation of neutrophils from the blood stream prior to causing damage within affected tissues. Inhibition of calpain-I with small molecule mercaptoacrylic acid derivatives slows the cell spreading process of live neutrophils and so these compounds represent promising drug leads. Here we present the 2.05 and 2.03 Å co-crystal X-ray structures of the pentaEF hand region, PEF(S), from human calpain with (Z)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid and (Z)-3-(5-bromoindol-3-yl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid. In both structures, the α-mercaptoacrylic acid derivatives bind between two α-helices in a hydrophobic pocket that is also exploited by a leucine residue of the endogenous regulatory calpain inhibitor calpastatin. Hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic rings of both inhibitors and the aliphatic residues of the pocket are integral for tight binding. In the case of (Z)-3-(5-bromoindol-3-yl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid, hydrogen bonds form between the mercaptoacrylic acid substituent lying outside the pocket and the protein and the carboxylate group is coplanar with the aromatic ring system. Multiple conformations of (Z)-3-(5-bromoindol-3-yl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid were found within the pocket. The increased potency of (Z)-3-(5-bromoindol-3-yl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid relative to (Z)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-mercaptoacrylic acid may be a consequence of the indole group binding more deeply in the hydrophobic pocket of PEF(S) than the phenyl ring.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

However, this method involves chemical fixatives and staining, which may alter the native morphology of elastin and collagen. Thus far, quantitative analysis of fiber damage in aorta and skin in Marfan syndrome has not yet been explored. In this study, we have used an advanced noninvasive and label-free imaging technique, multiphoton microscopy to quantify fiber fragmentation, disorganization, and total volumetric density of aortic and cutaneous elastin and collagen in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome. Aorta and skin samples were harvested from Marfan and control mice aged 3-, 6- and 9-month. Elastin and collagen were identified based on two-photon excitation fluorescence and second-harmonic-generation signals, respectively, without exogenous label. Measurement of fiber length indicated significant fragmentation in Marfan vs. control. Fast Fourier transform algorithm analysis demonstrated markedly lower fiber organization in Marfan mice. Significantly reduced volumetric density of elastin and collagen and thinner skin dermis were observed in Marfan mice. Cutaneous content of elastic fibers and thickness of dermis in 3-month Marfan resembled those in the oldest control mice.

""Transcytosis"" describes the transport of macromolecular cargo from one front of a polarized cell to the other within membrane-bounded carrier(s), via endocytosis, intracellular trafficking and exocytosis. Clathrin-mediated transcytosis is used extensively by epithelial cells, while caveolae-mediated transcytosis mostly occurs in endothelial cells. The internalization pathways were monitored by various markers, including radioisotopes, nanoparticles, enzymes, immunostains, and fluorophores. We describe an internalization pathway identified using a naturally-occurring biomarker, in vivo assembled ferritin, containing electron-dense iron cores. Iron, an essential trace metal for most living species and iron homeostasis, is crucial for cellular life. Ferritin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved archeoprotein whose main function is to store a reserve iron supply inside the cytoplasm in a non-toxic form. Ferritin is present in all organisms which have a metabolic requirement for iron and in even in organisms whose taxonomic rank is very low. The newborns of the blind mole, Spalax ehrenbergi, are born and live in a hypoxic environment and have significant iron overload in their liver and heart, but their iron metabolism has not been previously studied. These newborns, which are evolutionarily adapted to fluctuations in the environmental oxygen, have a unique ability to sequester transplacental iron and store it in ferritin without any signs of iron toxicity. Using the ferrihydrite cores of ferritin, we were able to monitor the ferritin internalization from portals of its entry into the cytosol of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes and into the lysosomes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, prominent methodologies commonly applied to investigate mechanical properties of bone on the micro scale are usually not able to concurrently describe both factors. In this study, we used polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS) to simultaneously analyze structural and chemical information of collagen fibrils in human osteonal bone in a single experiment. Specifically, the three-dimensional arrangement of collagen fibrils in osteonal lamellae was assessed. By analyzing the anisotropic intensity of the amide I Raman band of collagen as a function of the orientation of the incident laser polarization, different parameters related to the orientation of the collagen fibrils and the degree of alignment of the fibrils were derived. Based on the analysis of several osteons, two major fibrillar organization patterns were identified, one with a monotonic and another with a periodically changing twist direction. These results confirm earlier reported twisted and oscillating plywood arrangements, respectively. Furthermore, indicators of the degree of alignment suggested the presence of disordered collagen within the lamellar organization of the osteon. The results show the versatility of the analytical PRS approach and demonstrate its capability in providing not only compositional, but also 3D structural information in a complex hierarchically structured biological material. The concurrent assessment of chemical and structural features may contribute to a comprehensive characterization of the microstructure of bone and other collagen-based tissues.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Since the individual images are taken at low electron dose to avoid radiation damage, they are noisy and difficult to align with each other. This can result in incorrect maps, making validation essential. Pairs of electron micrographs taken at known angles to each other (tilt-pairs) can be used to measure the accuracy of assigned projection orientations and verify the soundness of calculated maps. Here we establish a statistical framework for evaluating images and density maps using tilt-pairs. The directional distribution of such angular data is modelled using a Fisher distribution on the unit sphere. This provides a simple, quantitative and easily comparable metric, the concentration parameter κ, for evaluating the quality of datasets and density maps that is independent of the data collection and analysis methods. A large κ is indicative of good agreement between the particle images and the 3D density map. For structure validation, we recommend κ>10 and a p-value <0.01.

With the advent of subtomogram averaging, as a post-processing step to CET, resolutions in the (sub-) nanometer range have become within reach. In addition to advances in instrumentation and experiments, the reconstruction scheme has improved by inclusion of more accurate contrast transfer function (CTF) correction methods, better defocus estimation, and better alignments of the tilt-series and subtomograms. To quantify the importance of each contribution, we have split the full process from data collection to reconstruction into different steps. For the purpose of evaluation we have acquired tilt-series of ribosomes in such a way that we could precisely determine the defocus of each macromolecule. Then, we simulated tilt-series using the InSilicoTEM package and applied tomogram reconstruction and subtomogram averaging. Through large scale simulations under different conditions and parameter settings we find that tilt-series alignment is the resolution limiting factor for our experimental data. Using simulations, we find that when this alignment inaccuracy is alleviated, tilted CTF correction improves the final resolution, or equivalently, the same resolution can be achieved using less particles. Furthermore, we predict from which resolution onwards better CTF correction and defocus estimation methods are required. We obtain a final average using 3198 ribosomes with a resolution of 2.2nm on the experimental data. Our simulations suggest that with the same number of particles a resolution of 1.2nm could be achieved by improving the tilt-series alignment.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

(2009) and Gupta et al. (2013) suggest that the extraordinary toughness of antler bone is primarily achieved by intrinsic/nanostructural mechanisms instead of extrinsic/microstructural mechanisms. However, this conclusion is based on data from extremely small specimens from one antler loaded only in tension, which impedes discernment of the relative importance of intrinsic vs. extrinsic mechanisms. In the present study we conducted analyses into the microstructural features of antler for details of potential additional microscale toughening characteristics, as suggested by recent mechanical testing studies of bulk specimens. The data are also considered in view of the above-mentioned studies concluding that extrinsic/microstructural toughening mechanisms are less important than nanoscale/intrinsic toughening mechanisms in antler. Mule deer antlers were evaluated using: (1) backscattered electron imaging for micro-mineralization, (2) circularly polarized light for osteonal interfacial complexity and collagen fiber orientation (CFO) heterogeneity, and (3) X-ray 3D micro-computed tomography for osteon/vessel orientation, density, and size. Results showed: (1) hyper-mineralized seams of approximately 3-4 microns thickness within relatively hypermineralized ""zones"" that course circuitously along osteonal interfaces, (2) highly heterogeneous CFO, including increased oblique-to-transverse CFO near/adjacent to osteon peripheries, and (3) osteons are often highly elongated in 2D. 3D reconstructions show that a considerable percentage of the vascular canals course obliquely with respect to the antler long axis.

NRC-1.,"RNase H1 from extreme halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (Halo-RNase H1) requires ⩾2M NaCl, ⩾10mM MnCl2, or ⩾300mM MgCl2 for folding. To understand the structural basis for this salt-dependent folding of Halo-RNase H1, the crystal structure of Halo-RNase H1 was determined in the presence of 10mM MnCl2. The structure of Halo-RNase H1 highly resembles those of metagenome-derived LC11-RNase H1 and Sulfolobus tokodaii RNase H1 (Sto-RNase H1), except that it contains two Mn(2+) ions at the active site and has three bi-aspartate sites on its surface. To examine whether negative charge repulsion at these sites are responsible for low-salt denaturation of Halo-RNase H1, a series of the mutant proteins of Halo-RNase H1 at these sites were constructed. The far-UV CD spectra of these mutant proteins measured in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl suggest that these mutant proteins exist in an equilibrium between a partially folded state and a folded state. However, the fraction of the protein in a folded state is nearly 0% for the active site mutant, 40% for the bi-aspartate site mutant, and 70% for the mutant at both sites in the absence of salt. The active site mutant requires relatively low concentration (∼0.5M) of salt for folding. These results suggest that suppression of negative charge repulsion at both active and bi-aspartate sites by salt is necessary to yield a folded protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

As part of the dioptric apparatus of the ommatidia within the complex eye it forms transparent micro-lenses that should as well maintain the mechanical stability of the head capsule. We analyzed the ultrastructure and composition of the isopod cornea cuticle of the terrestrial species Ligia oceanica and the marine Sphaeroma serratum. We used a variety of tissue preparation methods, electron microscopic techniques as well as electron microprobe analysis and Raman spectroscopic imaging. The results reveal various structural adaptations that likely increase light transmission. These are an increase in the thickness of the epicuticle, a reduction of the thickness of the outer layer of calcite, a spatial restriction of pore canals to interommatidial regions, and, for S. serratum only, an increase in calcite crystal size. In both species protein-chitin fibrils within the proximal exocuticle form a peculiar reticular structure that does not occur within the cuticle of the head capsule. In L. oceanica differential mineralization results in a spherically shaped interface between mineralized and unmineralized endocuticle, likely an adaptation to increase the refractive power of the cornea maintaining the mechanical stability of the cuticle between the ommatidia.

It consists of two ATPase domains (D1 and D2), with regulatory regions at the N- and C-terminals. We have recently shown that Cdc48p regulates mitochondrial morphology, in that a loss of the ATPase activity or positive cooperativity in the D2 domain leads to severe fragmentations and aggregations of mitochondria in the cytoplasm. We have now used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), an advanced three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopic technique to examine the structures and morphological changes of mitochondria in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that mutants lacking ATPase activity of Cdc48p showed mitochondrial fragmentations and aggregations, without fusion of the outer membrane. This suggests that the ATPase activity of Cdc48p is necessary for fusion of the outer membranes of mitochondria.

The interaction between CAP and vinculin is critical for the recruitment of CAP to focal adhesions. The tandem SH3 domains (herein termed SH3a and SH3b) of CAP are responsible for its interaction with vinculin. However, the structural mechanism underlying the interaction between CAP and vinculin is poorly understood. In this manuscript, we report the solution structure of the tandem SH3 domains of CAP. Our NMR and ITC data indicate that the SH3a and SH3b domains of CAP simultaneously bind to a long proline-rich region of vinculin with different binding specificities. Furthermore, the crystal structures of the individual SH3a and SH3b domains complexed with their substrate peptides indicate that Q807(SH3a) and D881(SH3b) are the critical residues determining the different binding specificities of the SH3 domains. Based on the obtained structural information, a model of the SH3ab-vinculin complex was generated using MD simulation and SAXS data.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The 6th Workshop on Coiled-Coils, Collagen and Fibrous Proteins was held at Alpbach, Austria in September 2013. As usual, it attracted delegates with structural interests in those protein systems where the coiled-coil motif plays an important role. These days, of course, this is not confined to the world of fibrous proteins but is found equally commonly in the globular ones too. Developments in both biophysical and biochemical aspects of the field proved a fertile ground for discussion, as did the interactions between those scientists whose interests lay primarily either in the extracellular proteins or the intracellular proteins (but, prior to Alpbach, rarely in both). The Special Issue presented here reveals a selection of the contributions made at the Workshop, and thereby provides a snapshot of where the field is now and where it is going over the next few years. Increasing numbers of crystal structures of the coiled-coil conformations observed in globular and fibrous proteins have revealed many more details of the relationship between amino acid sequence and the conformation observed. There is, of course, much more to the coiled coil than its structure alone, and the role of specific sequences that bestow a distinct function on these motifs has become more evident. Another point of considerable interest to emerge was that the conformations of the short regions between stretches of continuous heptad substructure are now describable at the atomic level. This refers not only to the wellestablished stutters, stammers and skips (deletions of three, four and six residues, respectively) where previous crystal data and modeling studies have been presented, but also now to the three other less common possibilities (deletions of one, two and five residues). An analogous study of breaks in the triplet phasing in collagen sequences was also presented. It has also became clear that the silk structures, and not those with the short sequence repeats that dominated the field in its early years, are increasingly being studied in detail, and these too are proving extremely informative. Some aspects of the 6th Workshop were different from those that preceded it. Importantly, Andrei Lupas and Dek Woolfson have taken over from John Squire and me as the new organizers. In so doing they have highlighted a variety of globular coiled-coil protein systems as well as biomaterials and silks. Core areas of research in the collagens and other a-fibrous proteins have been retained, of course, as has the compilation of a Special Issue of the Journal of Structural Biology. Our thanks go to the Editor, Dr. Alasdair Steven, for his support and encouragement in this particular venture. His support of the specialized field of coiled coils and fibrous proteins remains of great importance to us. In summary, protein researchers of all types will find much of interest in this Special Issue and the reader is strongly encouraged to investigate some of the treasures included.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A similar interaction has been identified as having a significant role in the formation of unit-length filaments, a precursor to intermediate filament formation. The present study is concerned with the spatial relationship of these interacting segments and its dependence on differences in the amino acid sequences of the two-chain regions that constitute the 1B molecular segment. It is shown that along a particular line of contact both chain segments possess an elevated concentration of residues with a high propensity for dimer formation. The transition from the reduced to the oxidized state involves a simple axial displacement of one molecular segment relative to the other, with no attendant rotation of either segment. This changes the inter-relationship of the two 1B molecular segments from a loosely packed form to a more compact one. After the slippage eight of the cysteine residues in the dimer are precisely aligned to link up and form the disulfide linkages as observed. The two remaining cysteine residues are located on the outside of the dimer and are presumably involved in inter-dimer bonding. The existence of a unique line of contact requires that two chains in the molecule have different amino acid compositions with the clustering of dimer-favoring residues phased by half the pitch length of the coiled coil.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

With template matching, the spatial positions of various macromolecular complexes within their native cellular context can be detected. However, the growing awareness of the reference bias introduced by the cross-correlation based approaches, and more importantly the lack of a reliable confidence measurement in the selection of these macromolecular complexes, has restricted the use of these applications. Here we propose a heuristic, in which the reference bias is measured in real space in an analogous way to the R-free value in X-ray crystallography. We measure the reference bias within the mask used to outline the area of the template, and do not modify the template itself. The heuristic works by splitting the mask into a working and a testing area in a volume ratio of 9:1. While the working area is used during the calculation of the cross-correlation function, the information from both areas is explored to calculate the M-free score. We show using artificial data, that the M-free score gives a reliable measure for the reference bias. The heuristic can be applied in template matching and in sub-tomogram averaging. We further test the applicability of the heuristic in tomograms of purified macromolecules, and tomograms of whole Mycoplasma cells.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition, many physiological functions have been described for APP, including a role in cell-cell- and cell-ECM-adhesion as well as in axonal outgrowth. We show here the molecular determinants of the oligomerization/dimerization of APP, which is central for its cellular (mis)function. Using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering and SEC-coupled static light scattering we demonstrate that the dimerization of APP is energetically induced by a heparin mediated dimerization of the E1 domain, which results in a dimeric interaction of E2. We also show that the acidic domain (AcD) interferes with the dimerization of E1 and propose a model where both, cis- and trans-dimerization occur dependent on cellular localization and function.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In SPRR the reliability and consequent interpretation of the final reconstruction is affected by errors arising from incorrect assignment of projection angles to individual particles. In order to improve the resolution of SPRR we studied the influence of imperfect assignment on 3D blurring. We find that this blurring can be described as a Point Spread Function (PSF) that depends on the distance from geometrical center of the reconstructed volume and that blurring is higher at the periphery. This particular PSF can be described by an almost pure tangential angular function with a negligible radial component. We have developed a reliable algorithm for spherical deconvolution of the 3D reconstruction. This spherical deconvolution operation was tested on reconstructions of GroEL and mitochondrial ribosomes. We show that spherical deconvolution improves the quality of SPRR by reducing blurring and enhancing high frequency components, particularly near the periphery of the reconstruction.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Utilizing various modalities of the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Software Suite including flexible peptide docking and protein design, we comprehensively explored the sequence space recognized by the CCT domain. Specifically, we studied single residue mutations as well as complete unbiased designs of a hexapeptide substrate. The computational study started from a crystal structure of the CCT domain of OSR1 in complex with a hexapeptide derived from WNK4. Point mutations predicted to be favorable include Arg to His or Trp substitutions at position 2 and a Phe to Tyr substitution at position 3 of the hexapeptide.

Delocalized π-electron clouds of aromatic residues are known to be involved in cation-π, CH-π, OH-π and π-π interactions. In proteins, many examples have been found in which the backbone carbonyl oxygen of one residue makes close contact with the aromatic center of aromatic residues. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that such contacts may provide stability to the protein secondary structures. In this study, we have systematically analyzed the experimentally determined high-resolution DNA crystal structures and identified 91 examples in which the aromatic center of one base is in close contact (<3.5Ǻ) with the oxygen atom of preceding (Group-I) or succeeding base (Group-II). Examples from Group-I are overwhelmingly observed and cytosine or thymine is the preferred base contributing oxygen atom in Group-I base pairs. A similar analysis of high-resolution RNA structures surprisingly did not yield many examples of oxygen-aromatic contact of similar type between bases. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations on compounds based on DNA crystal structures and model compounds show that interactions between the bases in base pairs with oxygen-aromatic contacts are energetically favorable. Decomposition of interaction energies indicates that dispersion forces are the major cause for energetically stable interaction in these base pairs. We speculate that oxygen-aromatic contacts in intra-strand base pairs in a DNA structure may have biological significance.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Five representative models of CmaA1 which correspond to different stages in the cyclopropanation process have been studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations and structural analyses provide a detailed account of the structural changes in the active sites of CmaA1. CmaA1 has two distinct binding sites, i.e., cofactor binding site (CBS) and acyl substrate binding site (ASBS). The apo state of CmaA1 corresponds to a closed conformation where the CBS is inaccessible due to the existence of H-bond between Pro202 of loop10 (L10) and Asn11 of N-terminal α1 helix. However, cofactor binding leads to the breaking of this H-bond and thus the H-bond is absent in the holo form. The hydrophobic side chains orient towards the inner side of the ASBS upon cofactor binding to create a hydrophobic environment for the substrate. The cofactor and substrate tend to come close to each other facilitated by opening of L10 to exchange the methyl group from the cofactor to the substrate. The MD study also revealed that the system tends to regain the apo conformation within 40ns after releasing the product.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although single particle cryo-EM requires less concentrated and smaller amounts of samples than X-ray crystallography, it remains challenging to study specimens that are low-abundance, low-yield, or short-lived. The recent development of affinity grid techniques can potentially further extend single particle cryo-EM to these challenging samples by combining sample purification and cryo-EM grid preparation into a single step. Here we report a new design of affinity cryo-EM approach, cryo-SPIEM, that applies a traditional pathogen diagnosis tool Solid Phase Immune Electron Microscopy (SPIEM) to the single particle cryo-EM method. This approach provides an alternative, largely simplified and easier to use affinity grid that directly works with most native macromolecular complexes with established antibodies, and enables cryo-EM studies of native samples directly from cell cultures. In the present work, we extensively tested the feasibility of cryo-SPIEM with multiple samples including those of high or low molecular weight, macromolecules with low or high symmetry, His-tagged or native particles, and high- or low-yield macromolecules. Results for all these samples (non-purified His-tagged bacteriophage T7, His-tagged Escherichiacoli ribosomes, native Sindbis virus, and purified but low-concentration native Tulane virus) demonstrated the capability of cryo-SPIEM approach in specifically trapping and concentrating target particles on TEM grids with minimal view constraints for cryo-EM imaging and determination of 3D structures.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The adaptor molecule MO25 not only recruits and activates LKB1 through the pseudokinase STRAD, but also may directly activate GCKs like MST3, MST4, STK25, OSR1 and SPAK. Targeting MO25 in a pathological setting has been recently studied in mouse. Yet the regulatory mechanism of MO25-mediated kinase activation is not fully understood. Here, our structural studies of MO25-related kinases reveal that MO25 binds to and activates GCK kinases or pseudokinase through a unified structural mechanism, featuring an active conformation of the αC helix and A-loop stabilized by MO25. Compared to GCKs that are directly activated by MO25-binding, activation of LKB1 has evolved additional layer of regulatory machinery, i.e., MO25 ""activates"" the pseudokinase STRAD, which in turn activates LKB1. Importantly, the structures of MO25α-STK25 and MO25α-MST3 determined in this work represent a transition/intermediate state and a fully activated state, respectively during the MO25-mediated kinase activating process.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although the importance of intermediate-filament elasticity in cellular mechanics is being increasingly recognized, the molecular basis of desmin's elasticity is not fully understood. We explored desmin elasticity by molecular combing with forces calculated to be as large as 4nN. Average filament contour length increased 1.55-fold axial on average. Molecular combing together with EGTA-treatment caused the fragmentation of the filament into short, 60 to 120-nm-long and 4-nm-wide structures. The fragments display a surface periodicity of 38nm, suggesting that they are composed of laterally attached desmin dimers. The axis of the fragments may deviate significantly from that of the overstretched filament, indicating that they have a large orientational freedom in spite of being axially interconnected. The emergence of protofibril fragments thus suggests that the interconnecting head or tail domains of coiled-coil desmin dimers are load-bearing elements during axial stretch.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Neither the details of the fibrinogen-fibrin transition, nor the exact mechanisms of fibrin degradation are fully understood at the molecular level. In the present work we investigated the nanoscale-changes in the viscoelasticity of the 3D-fibrin network during fibrinogenesis and streptokinase (STK)-induced fibrinolysis by using a novel application of force spectroscopy, named nano-thrombelastography. In this method the changes in the bending of an oscillating atomic-force-microscope (AFM) cantilever in human blood-plasma droplet were followed as a function of time. Whereas the global features of the time-dependent change in cantilever deflection corresponded well to a macroscopic thrombelastogram, the underlying force spectra revealed large, sample-dependent oscillations in the range of 3-50nN and allowed the separation of elastic and viscous components of fibrin behavior. Upon STK treatment the nano-thrombelastogram signal decayed gradually. The decay was driven by a decrease in thrombus elasticity, whereas thrombus viscosity decayed with a time delay. In scanning AFM images mature fibrin appeared as 17-nm-high and 12-196-nm-wide filaments. STK-treatment resulted in the decrease of filament height and the appearance of a surface roughness with 23.7nm discrete steps that corresponds well to the length of a fibrinogen monomer. Thus, the initial decay of thrombus elasticity during fibrinolysis may be caused by the axial rupture of fibrin fibers.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These reconstructions are calculated by averaging methods using images from electron micrographs of grids prepared using numerous filament preparations. Here we propose an alternative method to calculate the 3D-reconstruction of a single thick filament using only a tilt series images recorded by electron tomography. Relaxed thick filaments, prepared from tarantula leg muscle homogenates, were negatively stained. Single-axis tilt series of single isolated thick filaments were obtained with the electron microscope at a low electron dose, and recorded on a CCD camera by electron tomography. An IHRSR 3D-recontruction was calculated from the tilt series images of a single thick filament. The reconstruction was enhanced by including in the search stage dual tilt image segments while only single tilt along the filament axis is usually used, as well as applying a band pass filter just before the back projection. The reconstruction from a single filament has a 40 Å resolution and clearly shows the presence of MIH motifs. In contrast, the electron tomogram 3D-reconstruction of the same thick filament - calculated without any image averaging and/or imposition of helical symmetry - only reveals MIH motifs infrequently. This is - to our knowledge - the first application of the IHRSR method to calculate a 3D reconstruction from tilt series images. This single filament IHRSR reconstruction method (SF-IHRSR) should provide a new tool to assess structural differences between well-ordered thick (or thin) filaments in a grid by recording separately their electron tomograms.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Microscopic X-ray fluorescence/soft X-ray photoabsorption (μ-XRF/XAS) speciation mapping clarified that sulfate is the primary species in the coral skeleton, with minor amounts of organic sulfur, whereas both sulfate and organic sulfur coexist in coenenchyme. Analysis of the post-edge region of the XAS spectra confirmed that sulfate ions in the coral skeleton are mainly in the form of gypsum-like inorganic sulfate substituting for the carbonate ions in the calcite skeleton. The sulfate concentration was negatively correlated with the magnesium concentration and positively correlated with that of phosphorus. Speciation mapping of sulfate in the coral skeleton showed clear fluctuations with sulfate concentrations being higher at dark bands, whereas the small amount of organic sulfur had unclear dark/bright bands. These results suggest that the little organic sulfur that is present is contained in the organic matter embedded in the biocrystal of coral skeleton.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Most collagen sequences contain sporadic interruptions of this pattern, which may have functional roles in molecular flexibility, assembly or molecular recognition. However, the structural signatures of the different interruptions are not well defined. Here, a first comprehensive survey of collagen interruptions on collagen sequences from different taxonomic groups is presented. Amino acid preferences at the sites of interruption and the flanking triplets are analysed separately for metazoan and prokaryotic collagens and the concept of commensurateness between interruptions is introduced. Known structural information from model peptides is used to present a common framework for hydrogen bonding topology and variations in superhelical twist for the different types of interruptions. Several collagen interruptions are further classified here as stutters or stammers in analogy to the heptad breaks observed in alpha-helical coiled coils, and the structural consequences of commensurate interruptions in heterotrimeric collagens are briefly discussed.

The stability and homogeneity of these structures' mineral matrix was characterised along their radiuses, using Nassarius reticulatus as a model. Generally, they were proved to be bimineralic. Two of the three CaCO3 crystalline polymorphs occurring in biocarbonates - aragonite and calcite - coexist along statolith radiuses, aragonite being unequivocally the most abundant phase. The presence of a diffuse organic matrix was also perceived by the detection of a weak Raman band between 2800 and 3000 cm(-1) consistently observed along radiuses. Beyond the apparent stability and homogeneity, different crystalline orientations were disclosed by Raman spectroscopy. A change in the intensity pattern of the features related to the lattice and bending modes of aragonite between different radiuses give new insights for a possible spherulitic-like growth of these structures. As expected from the relative homogeneity of both mineral and organic signals, there was no pattern on the distribution of Ca, O, Na and S along radiuses. However, a higher concentration of Sr occurs in growth rings (known as winter tags), corroborating the already described negative correlation between the concentration of this element in statoliths and temperature. Despite the apparent stability and homogeneity of the matrix during its lifespan, the periodic distribution of Sr potentially influences a dissimilar incorporation of trace elements in increments and growth rings. Since gastropod statolith elemental fingerprinting was recently suggested as a new tool to monitor marine environmental changes, the pressing need for further studies on the incorporation of traces in these structures is highlighted.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

However, the host antibody immune response directed against their capsid, prevalent in ∼40-70% of the general population, depending on serotype, negatively impacts efficacy. AAVrh32.33, a novel vector developed from rhesus macaques isolates, has significantly lower seroprevalence in human populations compared to AAV2 and AAV8, which are both in clinical use. To better understand the capsid determinants of this differential immune response to AAVrh32.33, its structure was determined by X-ray crystallography to 3.5 Å resolution. The capsid viral protein (VP) structure conserves the eight-stranded β-barrel core and αA helix reported for other parvoviruses and the distinct capsid surface topology of the AAVs: a depression at the icosahedral twofold axis, three protrusions surrounding the threefold axis, and a depression surround a cylindrical channel at the fivefold axis. A comparison to AAV2, AAV4, and AAV8, to which AAVrh32.33 shares ∼61%, ∼81%, and ∼63% identity, respectively, identified differences in previously defined AAV VP structurally variable regions (VR-1 to VR-IX) which function as receptor attachment, transduction efficiency, and/or antigenic determinants. This structure thus provides a 3D platform for capsid engineering in ongoing efforts to develop AAVrh32.33, as well as other AAV serotypes, for tissue targeted gene-therapy applications with vectors that can evade pre-existing antibody responses against the capsid.

Our approach is inspired by a method of Sabanay et al. (1991) that is based on the Tokuyasu technique for immunogold labelling of sections from aldehyde-fixed samples. The difference of this method with the original Tokuyasu technique is that the immuno-labelled sections are stabilized in a thin layer of vitreous water by plunge-freezing prior to electron microscopical observation. The vitrification step allows for phase contrast-based imaging at cryogenic conditions. We show that this immuno-labelling method is well-suited for imaging cellular ultrastructure in three dimensions (tomography) at cryogenic conditions, and that fluorescence associated with the sections is retained.

Several approaches exist for correlative microscopy, most of which have used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the label for light microscopy. Here we use chemical tagging and synthetic fluorophores instead, in order to achieve protein-specific labeling, and to perform multicolor imaging. We show that synthetic fluorophores preserve their post-embedding fluorescence in the presence of uranyl acetate. Post-embedding fluorescence is of such quality that the specimen can be prepared with identical protocols for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); this is particularly valuable when singular or otherwise difficult samples are examined. We show that synthetic fluorophores give bright, well-resolved signals in super-resolution light microscopy, enabling us to superimpose light microscopic images with a precision of up to 25 nm in the x-y plane on electron micrographs. To exemplify the preservation quality of our new method we visualize the molecular arrangement of cadherins in adherens junctions of mouse epithelial cells.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we present a computational approach, PCT (particle correspondence from tilted pairs), based on tilt-invariant context and projection matching that addresses both problems. The method benefits from treating the two problems as a single optimization task.

Over the last two decades, the foremost efforts of computer scientists were devoted to proteins with aperiodic sequences having globular 3D structures. However, a large portion of proteins contain periodic sequences representing arrays of repeats that are directly adjacent to each other (so called tandem repeats or TRs). These proteins frequently fold into elongated fibrous structures carrying different fundamental functions. Algorithms specific to the analysis of these regions are urgently required since the conventional approaches developed for globular domains have had limited success when applied to the TR regions. The protein TRs are frequently not perfect, containing a number of mutations, and some of them cannot be easily identified. To detect such ""hidden"" repeats several algorithms have been developed. However, the most sensitive among them are time-consuming and, therefore, inappropriate for large scale proteome analysis. To speed up the TR detection we developed a rapid filter that is based on the comparison of composition and order of short strings in the adjacent sequence motifs. Tests show that our filter discards up to 22.5% of proteins which are known to be without TRs while keeping almost all (99.2%) TR-containing sequences. Thus, we are able to decrease the size of the initial sequence dataset enriching it with TR-containing proteins which allows a faster subsequent TR detection by other methods.

This signal transduction regulates the activity of associated kinases, altering the behavior of the flagellar motor and hence cell motility. Signaling is in turn modulated by selective methylation and demethylation of specific glutamate and glutamine residues in an adaptation subdomain. We have determined the structure of a chimeric protein, consisting of the HAMP domain from Archaeoglobus fulgidus Af1503 and the methyl-accepting domain of Escherichia coli Tsr. It shows a 21nm coiled coil that alternates between two coiled-coil packing modes: canonical knobs-into-holes and complementary x-da, a variant form related to the canonical one by axial rotation of the helices. Comparison of the obtained structure to the Thermotoga maritima chemoreceptor TM1143 reveals that they adopt different axial rotation states in their adaptation subdomains. This conformational change is presumably induced by the upstream HAMP domain and may modulate the affinity of the chemoreceptor to the methylation-demethylation system.

The dynein heavy chain contains a motor domain which is a member of the AAA+ protein family (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities). Proteins of the AAA+ family show a diverse range of functionalities, but share a related core AAA+ domain, which often assembles into hexameric rings. Dynein is unusual because it has all six AAA+ domains linked together, in one long polypeptide. The dynein motor domain generates movement by coupling ATP driven conformational changes in the AAA+ ring to the swing of a motile element called the linker. Dynein binds to its microtubule track via a long antiparallel coiled-coil stalk that emanates from the AAA+ ring. Recently the first high resolution structures of the dynein motor domain were published. Here we provide a detailed structural analysis of the six AAA+ domains using our Saccharomycescerevisiae crystal structure. We describe how structural similarities in the dynein AAA+ domains suggest they share a common evolutionary origin. We analyse how the different AAA+ domains have diverged from each other. We discuss how this is related to the function of dynein as a motor protein and how the AAA+ domains of dynein compare to those of other AAA+ proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We discuss the optimal use of DEDs for cryo-electron crystallography, introduce a new automatic image processing pipeline, and demonstrate the vast improvement in the resolution achieved by the use of both together, especially for highly tilted samples. The new processing pipeline (now included in the software package 2dx) exploits the high SNR and frame readout frequency of DEDs to automatically correct for beam-induced sample movement, and reliably processes individual crystal images without human interaction as data are being acquired. A new graphical user interface (GUI) condenses all information required for quality assessment in one window, allowing the imaging conditions to be verified and adjusted during the data collection session. With this new pipeline an automatically generated unit cell projection map of each recorded 2D crystal is available less than 5 min after the image was recorded. The entire processing procedure yielded a three-dimensional reconstruction of the 2D-crystallized ion-channel membrane protein MloK1 with a much-improved resolution of 5Å in-plane and 7Å in the z-direction, within 2 days of data acquisition and simultaneous processing.

The most successful and generally-applicable approach treats short segments of these filaments as independent ""single particles"", yielding near-atomic resolution for rigid and well-ordered filaments. The single-particle approach can also accommodate filament deformations, yielding sub-nanometer resolution for more flexible filaments. However, in the case of thin and flexible filaments, such as some amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils, the single-particle approach may fail because helical segments can be curved or otherwise distorted and their alignment can be inaccurate due to low contrast in the micrographs. We developed new software called Frealix that allows the use of arbitrarily short filament segments during alignment to approximate even high curvatures. All segments in a filament are aligned simultaneously with constraints that ensure that they connect to each other in space to form a continuous helical structure. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and benchmark it against datasets of Aβ(1-40) fibrils and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), both analyzed in earlier work. In the case of TMV, our algorithm achieves similar results to single-particle analysis. In the case of Aβ(1-40) fibrils, we match the previously-obtained resolution but we are also able to obtain reliable alignments and ∼8-Å reconstructions from curved filaments. Our algorithm also offers a detailed characterization of filament deformations in three dimensions and enables a critical evaluation of the worm-like chain model for biological filaments.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The C-module comprises 35 amino acids rich in glycine and proline residues (in GPGXY repeats) and one polyalanine stretch (Ala)8. All variants were found to be intrinsically disordered in solution, and upon fibril formation they converted into a cross-β structure. Heterologous seeding indicated high structural compatibility between the different eADF4(Cn) variants, however, their assembly kinetics differed in dependence of the number of repeats. Kinetic analysis revealed a nucleation-growth mechanism typical for the formation of cross-β-fibrils, with nucleation rates as well as growth rates increasing with increasing numbers of repeats. Strikingly, the single C-module did not self-assemble into fibrils, but upon addition of heterologous seeds fibril growth could be observed. Apparently, interconnecting of at least two C-modules significantly facilitates the structural transformation from a disordered state into β-sheet structures, which is necessary for nucleation and beneficial for fibril growth.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their main structural feature is a large central subdomain with numerous repeats folded in triple helical coiled-coils. Their similarity of sequence was considered to be low without detailed quantification of the intra- and intermolecular levels. Among the superfamily, we considered as essential to propose an overview of the surface properties of all the repeats of the five proteins of the spectrin family, namely α- and β-spectrins, α-actinin, dystrophin and utrophin. Therefore, the aim of this work was to obtain a quantitative comparison of all the repeats at both the primary sequence and the three-dimensional levels. For that purpose, we applied homology modelling methods to obtain structural models for successive and overlapping tandem repeats of the human erythrocyte α- and β-spectrins and utrophin, as previously undertaken for dystrophin, and we used the known structure of α-actinin. The matrix calculation of the pairwise similarities of all the repeat sequences and the electrostatic and hydrophobic surface properties throughout the protein family support the view that spectrins and α-actinin on one hand and utrophin and dystrophin on the other hand share some structural similarities, but a detailed molecular characterisation highlights substantial differences. The repeats within the family are far from identical, which is consistent with their multiple interactions with different cellular partners, including proteins and membrane lipids.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The fibrolamellar bone unit is initially formed by elaboration of a network of blood vessels. This is followed by the deposition of a thin, porous and hypercalcified layer, then by the infilling of the vascular cavities by the sequential deposition of a relatively thick rapidly forming bone on both sides of the hypercalcified layer, and finally by lamellar bone. We investigated the 3D structure of the collagenous network of fibrolamellar bone from the femora of a young minipig using mainly the FIB-SEM dual beam microscope and the Serial Surface View method. This enabled us to identify the fibril orientation, the canalicular network organization and other structural motifs within each element of the fibrolamellar unit. The first formed primary hypercalcified layer (PHL) is composed of fibril arrays and multiple small pores, and appears to have an isotropic structure. The major bone component is deposited on both sides of the PHL, and is composed of collagen fibrils with a preferred orientation, mainly aligned parallel to the bone long axis. This bone component is therefore parallel-fibered bone and not woven bone. We also observed that the collagen fibers are organized into bundles. The lamellar bone has most of its collagen fibrils aligned with the bone long axis. This study therefore shows that the large majority of collagen fibrils in fibrolamellar bone are aligned with the bone long axis. This anisotropic structure therefore appears to be adapted to loading along the bone long axis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Therefore we deployed a new selection system based on the twin-arginine translocase (TAT) pathway of Escherichia coli, named hitchhiker translocation (HiT) selection. A pool of α-helix encoding sequences was designed and selected for interference with the coiled coil domain (CC) of a melanoma-associated basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHLZ) protein, the microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF). One predominant sequence (iM10) was enriched during selection and showed remarkable protease resistance, high solubility and thermal stability while maintaining its specificity. Furthermore, it exhibited nanomolar range affinity towards the target peptide. A mutation screen indicated that target-binding helices of increased homodimer stability and improved expression rates were preferred in the selection process. The crystal structure of the iM10/MITF-CC heterodimer (2.1Å) provided important structural insights and validated our design predictions. Importantly, iM10 did not only bind to the MITF coiled coil, but also to the markedly more stable HLHLZ domain of MITF.

Our rotationally invariant features are based on the bispectrum. Each image is denoised and compressed using steerable principal component analysis (PCA) such that rotating an image is equivalent to phase shifting the expansion coefficients. Thus we are able to extend the theory of bispectrum of 1D periodic signals to 2D images. The randomized PCA algorithm is then used to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of the bispectrum coefficients, enabling fast computation of the similarity between any pair of images. The nearest neighbors provide an initial classification of similar viewing angles. In this way, rotational alignment is only performed for images with their nearest neighbors. The initial nearest neighbor classification and alignment are further improved by a new classification method called vector diffusion maps. Our pipeline for viewing angle classification and alignment is experimentally shown to be faster and more accurate than reference-free alignment with rotationally invariant K-means clustering, MSA/MRA 2D classification, and their modern approximations.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The aim of this study was to investigate ultrastructural changes during ZYMV-infection in Cucurbita pepo L. plants on the two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) level and to correlate these changes with the spread of ZYMV throughout the plant by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image analysis. This study revealed that after inoculation of the cotyledons ZYMV moved into roots [3 days post inoculation (dpi)], then moved upwards into the stem and apical meristem (5 dpi), then into the first true leaf (7 dpi) and could finally be found in all plant parts (9 dpi). ZYMV-infected cells contained viral inclusion bodies in the form of cylindrical inclusions (CIs). These CIs occurred in four different forms throughout the cytosol of roots and leaves: scrolls and pinwheels when cut transversely and long tubular structures and bundles of filaments when cut longitudinally. 3D reconstruction of ZYMV-infected cells containing scrolls revealed that they form long tubes throughout the cytosol. The majority has a preferred orientation and an average length and width of 3 μm and 120 nm, respectively. Image analysis revealed an increased size of cells and vacuoles (107% and 447%, respectively) in younger ZYMV-infected leaves leading to a similar ratio of cytoplasm to vacuole (about 1:1) in older and younger ZYMV-infected leaves which indicates advanced cell growth in younger tissues.

Segmentation of structural components present in 3D images (tomograms) is often necessary for their interpretation. However, it is severely hampered by a number of factors that are inherent to electron tomography (e.g. noise, low contrast, distortion). Thus, there is a need for new and improved computational methods to facilitate this challenging task. In this work, we present a new method for membrane segmentation that is based on anisotropic propagation of the local structural information using the tensor voting algorithm. The local structure at each voxel is then refined according to the information received from other voxels. Because voxels belonging to the same membrane have coherent structural information, the underlying global structure is strengthened. In this way, local information is easily integrated at a global scale to yield segmented structures. This method performs well under low signal-to-noise ratio typically found in tomograms of vitrified samples under cryo-tomography conditions and can bridge gaps present on membranes. The performance of the method is demonstrated by applications to tomograms of different biological samples and by quantitative comparison with standard template matching procedure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We are developing an integrated system for processing images of icosahedral particles during microscopy to provide reconstructed density maps in real-time at the highest possible resolution. The system is designed as a combination of pipelines to run in parallel on a computer cluster and analyzes micrographs as they are acquired, handling automatically all the processing steps from defocus estimation and particle picking to origin/orientation determination. An ab initio model is determined independently from the first micrographs collected, and new models are generated as more particles become available. As a proof of concept, we simulated data acquisition sessions using three sets of micrographs of good to excellent quality that were previously recorded from different icosahedral viruses. Results show that the processing of single micrographs can keep pace with an acquisition rate of about two images per minute. The reconstructed density map improves steadily during the image acquisition phase and its quality at the end of data collection is only moderately inferior to that obtained by expert users who processed semi-automatically all the micrographs after the acquisition.

The third variable region (V3 loop) of gp120 has an important role in co-receptor selection by gp120 and forms an epitope for neutralizing antibodies. In this work the dynamical behavior of the V3 loop in a trimeric environment has been investigated by generating an atomistic trimer model of gp120-CD4 complex and has been compared with the result of a monomeric gp120-CD4 complex. The main results coming from this work are that the three V3 loops belonging to the three subunits of the trimer display a different dynamical behavior in terms of its flexibility, spatial orientation, motion along the principal modes, conformations, solvent exposure and electrostatic potential distribution. We propose that the ability of the V3 loop to present, in the trimeric environment, simultaneous multiple alternative conformations that increase its capability of co-receptor recognition, is at least in part due to the effect of electrostatic potential generated by two subunits over the third one.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These threads are mainly composed of fibrillar collagens called preCols which are embedded in a proteinaceous matrix. One of the two so far identified matrix proteins is the Proximal Thread Matrix Protein 1 (PTMP1). PTMP1 comprises two von Willebrand factor type A-like domains (A1 and A2) in a special arrangement. Here, we describe the refolding of recombinant PTMP1 from inclusion bodies. PTMP1 refolded into two distinct monomeric isoforms. Both isomers exhibited alternative intramolecular disulfide bonds. One of these isomers is thermodynamically favored and presumably represents the native form of PTMP1, while the other isoform is kinetically favored but is likely non-native. Oligomerization during refolding was influenced by, but not strictly dependent on disulfide formation. The conformational stability of PTMP1 indicates an influence of intramolecular disulfides on the native state, but not on unfolding intermediates. Monomeric PTMP1 exhibited a high thermal stability, dependent on the pH of the surrounding environment. Especially under acidic conditions the disulfide bonds were critically involved in thermal stability.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A key step is the correct determination of the orientation of the particle in individual image projections. A useful tool for validation of the quality of a 3D map and its consistency with images is tilt-pair analysis. In a successful tilt-pair test, the relative angle between orientations assigned to each image of a tilt-pair agrees with the known relative rotation angle of the microscope specimen holder during the experiment. To make the procedure easy to apply to the increasing number of single particle maps, we have developed software and a web server for tilt-pair analysis. The tilt-pair analysis program reports the overall agreement of the assigned orientations with the known tilt angle and axis of the experiment and the distribution of tilt transformations for individual particles recorded in a single image field.

The proposed method implements a highly reliable matching strategy and tracking model to detect a huge number of feature tracks.

To further boost the material's biological/preclinical impact, SF is decorated with biologics, typically by carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling (EDC/NHS). For biomedical application, this chemistry challenges the product risk profile due to the formation of covalent aggregates, particularly when decoration is with biologics occurring naturally in humans as these aggregates may prime for autoimmunity. Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC; click chemistry) provides the necessary specificity to avoid such intermolecular, covalent aggregates. We present a blueprint outlining the necessary chemistry rendering SF compatible with CuAAC and with a particular focus on structural consequences. For that, the number of SF carboxyl groups (carboxyl-SF; required for EDC/NHS chemistry) or azido groups (azido-SF; required for click chemistry) was tailored by means of diazonium coupling of the SF tyrosine residues. Structural impact on SF and decorated SF was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The click chemistry yielded a better controlled product as compared to the EDC/NHS chemistry with no formation of inter- and intramolecular crosslinks as demonstrated for SF decorated with fluorescent model compounds or a biologic, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), respectively. In conclusion, SF can readily be translated into a scaffold compatible with click chemistry yielding decorated products with a better risk profile for biomedical application.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, in prokaryotic receptors no such structure has been reported, despite active research for many years. Here we present results of an alternative strategy, whereby a transmembrane receptor is made soluble by selective mutations to the membrane-spanning region, chosen by analysis of helix geometry in the transmembrane regions of chemotaxis receptors. We thus converted the receptor Af1503 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus to a soluble form by deleting transmembrane helix 1 and mutating the surface residues of transmembrane helix 2 to hydrophilic amino acids. Crystallization of this protein resulted in the structure of a tetrameric proteolytic fragment representing the modified transmembrane helices plus the cytoplasmic HAMP domain, a ubiquitous domain of prokaryotic signal transducers. The protein forms a tetramer via native parallel dimerization of the HAMP domain and non-native antiparallel dimerization of the modified transmembrane helices. The latter results in a four-helical coiled coil, characterized by unusually large changes in helix periodicity. The structure offers the first view of the junction between the transmembrane region and HAMP and explains the conservation of a key sequence motif in HAMP domains.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Since this region is sharply delimited from the area of available data, the reconstructed signal is typically hampered by convolution with its impulse response, which gives rise to the well-known missing wedge artefacts in 3D reconstructions. Despite the recent progress in the field of reconstruction and regularization techniques, the missing wedge artefacts remain untreated in most current reconstruction workflows in structural biology. Therefore we have designed a simple Fourier angular filter that effectively suppresses the ray artefacts in the single-axis tilting projection acquisition scheme, making single-axis tomographic reconstructions easier to interpret in particular at low signal-to-noise ratio in acquired projections.

However, apart from membrane lipid binding the function of SidC remains elusive. In order to characterize SidC further, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of SidC (amino acids 1-609, referred to as SidC-N) at 2.4Å resolution. SidC-N reveals a novel fold in which 4 potential subdomains (A-D) are arranged in a crescent-like structure. None of these subdomains currently has any known structural homologues, raising the question of how this fold has evolved. These domains are highly interconnected, with a low degree of flexibility towards each other.

BIR2 is a negative regulator of BAK1-mediated defense mechanisms and cell death responses, yet key residues that are typically required for kinase activity are not present in the BIR2 kinase domain. We have determined the crystal structure of the BIR2 cytosolic domain and show that its nucleotide binding site is occluded. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that neither wild type nor phosphorylation-mimicking mutants of BIR2 bind ATP-analogues in solution, suggesting that BIR2 is a genuine enzymatically inactive pseudokinase.

The elongate cortex cells of mature fibres are composed primarily of macrofibrils-bundles of hard-keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) chemically cross-linked within a globular protein matrix. In wool, three cell types (ortho-, meso- and paracortex) contain macrofibrils with distinctly different filament arrangements and matrix fractions, but in human hair macrofibril-cell type relationships are less clear. Here we show that hair macrofibrils all have a similar matrix fraction (∼0.4) and are typically composed of a double-twist architecture in which a central IF is surrounded by concentric rings of tangentially-angled IFs. The defining parameter is the incremental angle increase (IF-increment) between IFs of successive rings. Unlike the wool orthocortex, hair double-twist macrofibrils have considerable inter-macrofibril variation in IF increment (0.05-0.35°/nm), and macrofibril size and IF increment are negatively correlated. Correspondingly, angular difference between central and outer-most IFs is up to 40° in small macrofibrils, but only 5-10° in large macrofibrils. Single cells were observed containing mixtures of macrofibrils with different diameters.

One or more of the intermediate hierarchical levels consists of tissues in which the cellular distribution is quasi-random, a factor that affects the elastic properties of the tissues. The current work focuses on the finite element analysis (FEA) of the constituent tissues of the plant Rheum rhabarbarum (rhubarb). The geometric model is generated via a recently introduced method: the finite edge centroidal Voronoi tessellation (FECVT), which is capable to capture the gradients of cellularity and diversified pattern of cellular materials, as opposed to current approaches in literature. The effective stiffness of the tissues is obtained by using an accurate numerical homogenization technique via detailed finite element analysis of the models of sub-regions of the tissues. As opposed to a large-scale representative volume element (RVE), statistical volume elements (SVE) are considered in this work to model tissue microstructures that are highly random. 2D finite element analyses demonstrate that the distribution of cells in collenchyma and parenchyma tissue make them stiffer in two different directions, while the overall effect of the combined tissues results in approximately equal stiffness in both directions. The rhubarb tissues, on the other hand, are more compliant than periodic and quasi-uniform random cellular materials by a factor of up to 47% and 44%, respectively.

Here we describe a new method that utilizes strong oxidation and chemical linkage to introduce a high density of bioactive ligands onto nanometer-thick carbon films and enable selective enrichment of individual macromolecular complexes at subnanogram levels. The introduced ligands are physically separated. Ni-NTA, Protein G and DNA/RNA oligonucleotides were covalently linked to the carbon surface. They embody negligible mass and their stability makes the functionalized films able to survive long-term storage and tolerate variations in pH, temperature, salts, detergents, and solvents. We demonstrated the application of the new method to the electron microscopic imaging of the substrate-bound C3PO, an RNA-processing enzyme important for the RNA interference pathway. On the ssRNA-linked carbon surface, the formation of C3PO oligomers at subnanomolar concentrations likely mimics their assembly onto ssRNA substrates presented by their native partners. Interestingly, the 3D reconstructions by negative stain EM reveal a side port in the C3PO/ssRNA complex, and the 15Å cryoEM map showed extra density right above the side port, which probably represents the ssRNA. These results suggest a new way for ssRNAs to interact with the active sites of the complex. Together our data demonstrate that the surface-engineered carbon films are suitable for selectively enriching low-abundance biological complexes at nanomolar level and for developing novel applications on a large number of surface-presented molecules.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

These bacterial collagens share the distinctive Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating amino acid sequence of animal collagens which underlies their unique triple-helical structure. A number of the bacterial collagens have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and they all adopt a triple-helix conformation. Unlike animal collagens, these bacterial proteins do not contain the post-translationally modified amino acid, hydroxyproline, which is known to stabilize the triple-helix structure and may promote self-assembly. Despite the absence of collagen hydroxylation, the triple-helix structures of the bacterial collagens studied exhibit a high thermal stability of 35-39°C, close to that seen for mammalian collagens. These bacterial collagens are readily produced in large quantities by recombinant methods, either in the original amino acid sequence or in genetically manipulated sequences. This new family of recombinant, easy to modify collagens could provide a novel system for investigating structural and functional motifs in animal collagens and could also form the basis of new biomedical materials with designed structural properties and functions.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

These coiled coil silk proteins share a characteristic distinct from other coiled coil proteins, in that they are fabricated into solid materials after accumulating as highly concentrated solutions within dedicated glands.

We investigate conserved and convergently evolved features within these proteins and compare these to the features of classic coiled coil proteins including tropomyosin and leucine zippers. Our analysis finds that the coiled coil domains of insect silk proteins have several common structural anomalies including a high prevalence of alanine residues in core positions. These atypical features of the coiled coil fibrous proteins - which likely produce deviations from canonical coiled-coil structure - likely exist due to selection pressures related to the process of silk fabrication and the final function of the proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The data suggested that two potential peptide regions from domain II and one peptide region from domain III of uPAR, interact with αvβ6 integrin.

A similar interaction has been identified as having a significant role in the formation of unit-length filaments, a precursor to intermediate filament formation. The present study is concerned with the spatial relationship of these interacting segments and its dependence on differences in the amino acid sequences of the two-chain regions that constitute the 1B molecular segment. It is shown that along a particular line of contact both chain segments possess an elevated concentration of residues with a high propensity for dimer formation. The transition from the reduced to the oxidized state involves a simple axial displacement of one molecular segment relative to the other, with no attendant rotation of either segment. This changes the inter-relationship of the two 1B molecular segments from a loosely packed form to a more compact one. After the slippage eight of the cysteine residues in the dimer are precisely aligned to link up and form the disulfide linkages as observed. The two remaining cysteine residues are located on the outside of the dimer and are presumably involved in inter-dimer bonding. The existence of a unique line of contact requires that two chains in the molecule have different amino acid compositions with the clustering of dimer-favoring residues phased by half the pitch length of the coiled coil.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

New metrics are needed that can determine whether a given 3D reconstruction accurately reflects the structure of the particles from which it was derived or instead depicts a plausible though incorrect structure due to coarse misalignment of particles. Here an empirical procedure is presented for differentiating between a reconstruction with well-aligned particles and a reconstruction with grossly misclassified particles. For a given dataset, 3D reconstructions are computed from subsets of particles with decreasing numbers of particles contributing to the reconstruction. A plot of inverse resolution vs. the logarithm of the number of particles (a ""ResLog"" plot) provides metrics for the reliability of the reconstruction and the overall quality of the dataset and processing. Specifically, the y-intercept of a regression line provides a measure of the relative accuracy of the particle alignment and classification, and the slope is an indicator of the overall data quality including the imaging conditions and processing steps. ResLog plots can also be used to optimize conditions for data collection and reconstruction parameters. Although resolution estimates can vary by method of calculation, ResLog-derived parameters are consistent whether calculated by Fourier shell correlation or Fourier neighbor correlation, or a new coordinate-based metric that serves as a yardstick for structures where atomic coordinates are available.

Under both normal and stress conditions, sHSPs bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation. Canonical vertebrate sHSPs, such as the α-crystallins, form large polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies dissociate. Here we focus on human HSPB6 which, despite having considerable homology to the α-crystallins in both the N-terminal region and the signature α-crystallin domain (ACD), only forms dimers in solution that represent the basic chaperoning subspecies. We addressed the three-dimensional structure and functional properties of HSPB6 in a hybrid study employing X-ray crystallography, solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), mutagenesis, size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. The crystal structure of a proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical ACD dimers which further form tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the β4/β8 grooves. The patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in the N-terminal domain directly adjacent to the ACD, that are resembling but distinct from the canonical IxI sequence commonly binding this groove. By combining the crystal structure with SAXS data for the full-length protein, we derive a molecular model of the latter. In solution, HSPB6 shows a strong attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning activity. Both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact N-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate sHSPs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, crystal unbending and Fourier-filtering methods in electron crystallography three-dimensional (3D) image processing are generally limited in their performance for 2D crystals that are badly ordered or non-flat. Here we present a single particle image processing approach, which is implemented as an extension of the 2D crystallographic pipeline realized in the 2dx software package, for the determination of high-resolution 3D structures of membrane proteins. The algorithm presented, addresses the low single-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2D crystal images by exploiting neighborhood correlation between adjacent proteins in the 2D crystal. Compared with conventional single particle processing for randomly oriented particles, the computational costs are greatly reduced due to the crystal-induced limited search space, which allows a much finer search space compared to classical single particle processing. To reduce the considerable computational costs, our software features a hybrid parallelization scheme for multi-CPU clusters and computer with high-end graphic processing units (GPUs). We successfully apply the new refinement method to the structure of the potassium channel MloK1.

Receptor-agonist interactions increased the stability of these AF-2 fixed motifs in the agonist conformation.

The dephosphorylated state of full-length monomeric myosin is characterized by an asymmetric intramolecular head-head interaction that completely inhibits the ATPase activity, accompanied by a hairpin fold of the tail, which prevents filament assembly. Phosphorylation of serine 19 disrupts these head-head interactions by an unknown mechanism. Computational modeling (Tama et al., 2005. J. Mol. Biol. 345, 837-854) suggested that formation of the inhibited state is characterized by both torsional and bending motions about the myosin heavy chain (HC) at a location between the RLC and the essential light chain (ELC). Therefore, altering relative motions between the ELC and the RLC at this locus might disrupt the inhibited state. Based on this hypothesis we have derived an atomic model for the phosphorylated state of the smooth muscle myosin light chain domain (LCD). This model predicts a set of specific interactions between the N-terminal residues of the RLC with both the myosin HC and the ELC. Site directed mutagenesis was used to show that interactions between the phosphorylated N-terminus of the RLC and helix-A of the ELC are required for phosphorylation to activate smooth muscle myosin.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The axial periodicity may adopt even multiples of the pitch value. Coiled coil motifs form the largest portion of the hornet silk structure and are aligned nearly parallel to the cocoon fiber axis in the same way as the membrane-like parts of the cocoon are molecularly orientated in the spinning direction. Supercoils were found to be associated with β-crystals, predominantly localized in the l-serine-rich chain sequences terminating each of the four predominant silk proteins.

Proteins embedded in DNA bubble sooner than free-standing proteins and DNA does not bubble under the same conditions. These properties make it possible to distinguish protein from DNA. Here we explored the scope of this technique (""bubblegram imaging"") by applying it to bacteriophage T7, viewed as a partially defined model system. T7 has a thin-walled icosahedral capsid, 60 nm in diameter, with a barrel-shaped protein core under one of its twelve vertices (the portal vertex). The core is densely wrapped with DNA but details of their interaction and how their injection into a host bacterium is coordinated are lacking. With short (10 s) intervals between exposures of 17 electrons/Å(2) each, bubbling starts in the third exposure, with 1-4 bubbles nucleating in the core: in subsequent exposures, these bubbles grow and merge. A 3D reconstruction from fifth-exposure images depicts a bipartite cylindrical gas cloud in the core. In its portal-proximal half, the axial region is gaseous whereas in the portal-distal half, it is occupied by a 3 nm-wide dense rod. We propose that they respectively represent core protein and an end of the packaged genome, poised for injection into a host cell. Single bubbles at other sites may represent residual scaffolding protein. Thus, bubbling depends on dose rate, protein amount, and tightness of the DNA seal.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Many fitting methods have been developed, but a standard protocol for successful fitting and assessment of fitted models has yet to be agreed upon among the experts in the field. Here, we created and tested a protocol that highlights important issues related to homology modelling, density map segmentation, rigid and flexible fitting, as well as the assessment of fits. As part of it, we use two different flexible fitting methods (Flex-EM and iMODfit) and demonstrate how combining the analysis of multiple fits and model assessment could result in an improved model. The protocol is applied to the case of the mature and empty capsids of Coxsackievirus A7 (CAV7) by flexibly fitting homology models into the corresponding cryoEM density maps at 8.2 and 6.1 Å resolution. As a result, and due to the improved homology models (derived from recently solved crystal structures of a close homolog – EV71 capsid – in mature and empty forms), the final models present an improvement over previously published models. In close agreement with the capsid expansion observed in the EV71 structures, the new CAV7 models reveal that the expansion is accompanied by ∼5° counterclockwise rotation of the asymmetric unit, predominantly contributed by the capsid protein VP1.

However, disorder, flexibility, and heterogeneity often hinder structural analyses. CryoEM and single particle image processing techniques offer the possibility of imaging samples with significant flexibility. Division of particle images into more homogenous subsets after data acquisition can help compensate for heterogeneity within the sample. We present the utility of an eigenimage sorting analysis for examining two protein/DNA complexes with significant conformational flexibility and heterogeneity. These complexes are integral to the non-homologous end joining pathway, and are involved in the repair of double strand breaks of DNA. Both complexes include the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and biotinylated DNA with bound streptavidin, with one complex containing the Ku heterodimer. Initial 3D reconstructions of the two DNA-PKcs complexes resembled a cryoEM structure of uncomplexed DNA-PKcs without additional density clearly attributable to the remaining components. Application of eigenimage sorting allowed division of the DNA-PKcs complex datasets into more homogeneous subsets. This led to visualization of density near the base of the DNA-PKcs that can be attributed to DNA, streptavidin, and Ku. However, comparison of projections of the subset structures with 2D class averages indicated that a significant level of heterogeneity remained within each subset. In summary, image sorting methods allowed visualization of extra density near the base of DNA-PKcs, suggesting that DNA binds in the vicinity of the base of the molecule and potentially to a flexible region of DNA-PKcs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Most importantly, we show that it is possible to fill in partially the unsampled region in Fourier space with meaningful information without making assumptions about the data or applying prior knowledge.

We demonstrate that these grids can be used for cryo-EM. Furthermore, we show that by applying image shifts to obtain movies of the carbon regions beside the holes after imaging the holes, the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters needed for calculation of high-resolution cryo-EM maps with a DDD can be obtained efficiently.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In some cases structural information can be combined with X-ray data leading to atomic resolution in situ. However, CEMOVIS is not routinely used. The two critical steps consist of producing a frozen section ribbon of a few millimeters in length and transferring the ribbon onto an electron microscopy grid. During these steps, the first sections of the ribbon are wrapped around an eyelash (unwrapping is frequent). When a ribbon is sufficiently attached to the eyelash, the operator must guide the nascent ribbon. Steady hands are required. Shaking or overstretching may break the ribbon. In turn, the ribbon immediately wraps around itself or flies away and thereby becomes unusable. Micromanipulators for eyelashes and grids as well as ionizers to attach section ribbons to grids were proposed. The rate of successful ribbon collection, however, remained low for most operators. Here we present a setup composed of two micromanipulators. One of the micromanipulators guides an electrically conductive fiber to which the ribbon sticks with unprecedented efficiency in comparison to a not conductive eyelash. The second micromanipulator positions the grid beneath the newly formed section ribbon and with the help of an ionizer the ribbon is attached to the grid. Although manipulations are greatly facilitated, sectioning artifacts remain but the likelihood to investigate high quality sections is significantly increased due to the large number of sections that can be produced with the reported tool.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In the past decade, the single-particle technique has had an important impact on the advancement of helical reconstruction. Here, we present the software package SPRING that combines Fourier based symmetry analysis and real-space helical processing into a single workflow. One of the most time-consuming steps in helical reconstruction is the determination of the initial symmetry parameters. First, we propose a class-based helical reconstruction approach that enables the simultaneous exploration and evaluation of many symmetry combinations at low resolution. Second, multiple symmetry solutions can be further assessed and refined by single-particle based helical reconstruction using the correlation of simulated and experimental power spectra. Finally, the 3D structure can be determined to high resolution. In order to validate the procedure, we use the reference specimen Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). After refinement of the helical symmetry, a total of 50,000 asymmetric units from two micrographs are sufficient to reconstruct a subnanometer 3D structure of TMV at 6.4Å resolution. Furthermore, we introduce the individual programs of the software and discuss enhancements of the helical reconstruction workflow. Thanks to its user-friendly interface and documentation, SPRING can be utilized by the novice as well as the expert user. In addition to the study of well-ordered helical structures, the development of a streamlined workflow for single-particle based helical reconstruction opens new possibilities to analyze specimens that are heterogeneous in symmetries.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we used a combination of three-dimensional cryo-electron tomography and two-dimensional image analysis to study pleomorphic maturation intermediates of dengue virus 2. Icosahedral symmetries of immature and mature regions within one particle were mismatched relative to each other. Furthermore, the orientation of the two regions relative to each other differed among particles. Therefore, there cannot be a specific pathway determining the maturation of all particles. Instead, the region with mature structure expands when glycoproteins on its boundary acquire suitable orientation and conformation to allow them to become a stable part of the mature region. This type of maturation is possible because the envelope glycoproteins are anchored to the phospholipid bilayer that is a part of flavivirus virions and are thus restricted to movement on the two-dimensional surface of the particle. Therefore, compounds that limit movement of the glycoproteins within the virus membrane might be used as inhibitors of flavivirus maturation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Amyloidogenic properties of apoA-I are determined mainly by its N-terminal fragment.

To achieve such integration, the primary technical challenge that must be solved regards how to arrange two objective lenses used for light and electron microscopy in such a manner that they can properly focus on a single specimen. To address this issue, both lateral displacement of the specimen between two lenses and specimen rotation have been proposed. Such movement of the specimen allows sequential collection of two kinds of microscopic images of a single target, but prevents simultaneous imaging. This shortcoming has been made up by using a simple optical device, a reflection mirror.

The growth rate of the compression wood is faster than in the upper part resulting in a renewed horizontal growth. The actuating and load-carrying function of the compression wood is addressed, on the basis of its special ultrastructure and shape of the tracheids. As a first step, a quantitative model is developed to predict the difference of moisture-induced expansion and axial stiffness between normal wood and compression wood. The model is based on a state space approach using concentric cylinders with anisotropic helical structure for each cell-wall layer, whose hygroelastic properties are in turn determined by a self-consistent concentric cylinder assemblage of the constituent wood polymers. The predicted properties compare well with experimental results found in the literature. Significant differences in both stiffness and hygroexpansion are found for normal and compression wood, primarily due to the large difference in microfibril angle and lignin content. On the basis of these numerical results, some functional arguments for the reason of high microfibril angle, high lignin content and cylindrical structure of compression wood tracheids are supported.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To overcome the challenge of disorder in the imaged structures, we analyze each image individually, avoiding information loss through clustering or averaging. The Bayesian inference of EM (BioEM) method uses a likelihood-based probabilistic measure to quantify the consistency between each EM image and given structural models. The likelihood function accounts for uncertainties in the molecular position and orientation, variations in the relative intensities and noise in the experimental images. The BioEM formalism is physically intuitive and mathematically simple. We show that for experimental GroEL images, BioEM correctly identifies structures according to the functional state. The top-ranked structure is the corresponding X-ray crystal structure, followed by an EM structure generated previously from a superset of the EM images used here. To analyze EM images of highly flexible molecules, we propose an ensemble refinement procedure, and validate it with synthetic EM maps of the ESCRT-I-II supercomplex. Both the size of the ensemble and its structural members are identified correctly. BioEM offers an alternative to 3D-reconstruction methods, extracting accurate population distributions for highly flexible structures and their assemblies. We discuss limitations of the method, and possible applications beyond ensemble refinement, including the cross-validation and unbiased post-assessment of model structures, and the structural characterization of systems where traditional approaches fail.

The raw data is very noisy and consists of two-dimensional projections, from which the 3D biological object must be reconstructed. The 3D object depends upon knowledge of proper angular orientations assigned to the 2D projection images. Numerous algorithms have been developed for determining relative angular orientations between 2D images, but the transition from 2D to 3D remains challenging and can result in erroneous and conflicting results. Here we describe a general, automated procedure, called OptiMod, for reconstructing and optimizing 3D models using common-lines methodologies. OptiMod approximates orientation angles and reconstructs independent maps from 2D class averages. It then iterates the procedure, while considering each map as a raw solution that needs to be compared with other possible outcomes. We incorporate procedures for 3D alignment, clustering, and refinement to optimize each map, as well as standard scoring metrics to facilitate the selection of the optimal model. We also show that small angle tilt-pair data can be included as one of the scoring metrics to improve the selection of the optimal initial model, and also to provide a validation check. The overall approach is demonstrated using two experimental cryo-EM data sets--the 80S ribosome that represents a relatively straightforward case for ab initio reconstruction, and the Tf-TfR complex that represents a challenging case in that it has previously been shown to provide multiple equally plausible solutions to the initial model problem.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The structure is highly similar to its bacterial counterpart although several loop regions show significant differences with potential implications for the enzymatic properties. Furthermore, we have found a metal ion with octahedral coordination at the same location as a zinc ion in the bacterial enzyme.

Specific interactions between scaffolding proteins are known to have important roles for the formation and maintenance of nuclear structures. General physical mechanisms such as molecular crowding, phase separation or colloidal behavior have also been suggested, but their physiological significance remains uncertain. For macromolecular crowding, a role in the maintenance of nucleoli and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies has been shown. Here, we tested whether a modulation of the compaction state of chromatin, which directly influences the local crowding state, has an impact on the formation and maintenance of densely packed heterochromatin. By osmotic perturbations, we could modify the packing state of chromatin in a controlled manner and show that chromatin compaction, which is associated with increased crowding conditions, is not, per se, sufficient to initiate the formation of new bona fide heterochromatin structures nor is it necessary to maintain already established heterochromatin domains. In consequence, if an increase in crowding induced by chromatin compaction maybe an early step in heterochromatin formation, specific protein-protein interactions are nevertheless required to make heterochromatin long lasting and independent of the crowding state.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

This is particularly interesting as the presence of a trans-dictyosomal ER system is well known from mammalian secretory cells but not from cells of higher plants to which the alga Micrasterias is closely related. In contrast to findings in plant storage tissue indicating that MVBs originate from the trans-Golgi network or its derivatives our investigations show that MVBs in Micrasterias are in direct spatial contact with both, trans-Golgi cisternae and the trans-ER sheath which provides evidence that both endomembrane compartments are involved in their formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis there are five paralogous ESX secretion systems, named ESX-1 through ESX-5. Each system includes a subtilisin-like protease (mycosin or MycP) as a core component essential for secretion. Here we report crystal structures of MycP1 and MycP3, the mycosins expressed by the ESX-1 and ESX-3 systems, respectively. In both mycosins the putative propeptide wraps around the catalytic domain and does not occlude the active site. The extensive contacts between the putative propeptide and catalytic domain, which include a disulfide bond, suggest that the N-terminal extension is an integral part of the active mycosin. The catalytic residues of MycP1 and MycP3 are located in a deep active site groove in contrast with an exposed active site in majority of subtilisins. We show that MycP1 specifically cleaves ESX-1 secretion-associated protein B (EspB) in vitro at residues Ala358 and Ala386. We also systematically characterize the specificity of MycP1 using peptide libraries, and show that it has evolved a narrow specificity relative to other subtilisins. Finally, comparison of the MycP1 and MycP3 structures suggest that both enzymes have stringent and different specificity profiles that result from the structurally distinct active site pockets, which could explain the system specific functioning of these proteases.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Few studies have focused on the structure-mechanical property relationship and its link to the multi-scale architecture of human enamel, whereby the response to mechanical loading is affected not only by the rod distribution at micro-scale, but also strongly influenced by the mineral crystallite shape, and spatial arrangement and orientation. In this study, two complementary synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques, wide and small angle X-ray scattering (WAXS/SAXS) were used to obtain multi-scale quantitative information about the structure and deformation response of human enamel to in situ uniaxial compressive loading. The apparent modulus was determined linking the external load and the internal strain in hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystallites. An improved multi-scale Eshelby model is proposed taking into account the two-level hierarchical structure of enamel. This framework has been used to analyse the experimental data for the elastic lattice strain evolution within the HAp crystals. The achieved agreement between the model prediction and experiment along the loading direction validates the model and suggests that the new multi-scale approach reasonably captures the structure-property relationship for the human enamel. The ability of the model to predict multi-directional strain components is also evaluated by comparison with the measurements. The results are useful for understanding the intricate relationship between the hierarchical structure and the mechanical properties of enamel, and for making predictions of the effect of structural alterations that may occur due to the disease or treatment on the performance of dental tissues and their artificial replacements.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Kar3 represents a canonical kinesin motor domain that interacts with microtubules under the control of ATP-hydrolysis. In vivo, the localization and function of Kar3 is differentially regulated by its interacting stoichiometrically with either Cik1 or Vik1, two closely related motor homology domains that lack the nucleotide-binding site. Indeed, Vik1 structurally resembles the core of a kinesin head. Despite being closely related, Kar3Cik1 and Kar3Vik1 are each responsible for a distinct set of functions in vivo and also display different biochemical behavior in vitro. To determine a structural basis for their distinct functional abilities, we used cryo-electron microscopy and helical reconstruction to investigate the 3-D structure of Kar3Cik1 complexed to microtubules in various nucleotide states and compared our 3-D data of Kar3Cik1 with that of Kar3Vik1 and the homodimeric kinesin-14 Ncd from Drosophila melanogaster. Due to the lack of an X-ray crystal structure of the Cik1 motor homology domain, we predicted the structure of this Cik1 domain based on sequence similarity to its relatives Vik1, Kar3 and Ncd. By molecular docking into our 3-D maps, we produced a detailed near-atomic model of Kar3Cik1 complexed to microtubules in two distinct nucleotide states, a nucleotide-free state and an ATP-bound state. Our data show that despite their functional differences, heterodimeric Kar3Cik1 and Kar3Vik1 and homodimeric Ncd, all share striking structural similarities at distinct nucleotide states indicating a common mechanistic theme within the kinesin-14 family.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

X-ray diffraction in combination with elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy showed that the mineral phase of the teeth is a carbonated calcium-deficient nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite in all three tooth-constituting tissues: Dentin, enamel, and cementum. The fluoride content in the three tissues is very low (<0.1 wt.%) and comparable to that in human teeth. The mineral content of dentin, enamel, and cementum as determined by thermogravimetry is 71.3, 80.5, and 66.8 wt.%, respectively. Synchrotron X-ray microtomography showed the internal structure and allowed to visualize the degree of mineralization in dentin, enamel, and cementum. Virtual sections through the tooth and scanning electron micrographs showed that the enamel layer is comparably thin (100-200 μm). The crystallites in the enamel are oriented perpendicularly to the tooth surface. At the dentin-enamel-junction, the packing density of crystallites decreases, and the crystallites do not display an ordered structure as in the enamel. The microhardness was 0.60±0.05 GPa for dentin, 3.15±0.15 GPa for enamel, 0.26±0.08 GPa for cementum close to the crown, and 0.31±0.04 GPa for cementum close to the root margin.

We introduce a general method to quantitatively investigate the clustering of arrestin following stimulation of the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) using single-molecule super-resolution imaging and coordinate and image-based cluster analysis. We investigated the effect of potent anti-HIV ligands of CCR5 with different pharmacological profiles on arrestin2 cluster formation and found that only the ligands capable of inducing CCR5 internalization induced arrestin2 recruitment and clustering. We further demonstrate that the fraction of arrestin2 molecules found in clusters larger than 100nm correlates with the magnitude of ligand-induced CCR5 internalization, but not with G protein activation, indicating that recruitment of arrestin2 to CCR5 is independent of G protein activation. Pre-treatment of the cells with the drug cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization, led to the formation of larger clusters, whereas the inhibitor of microtubule polymerization nocodazole had little effect on arrestin2 recruitment, suggesting an active role of actin in the organization and dynamics of these aggregates.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To facilitate in vitro characterization of phosphate prodrugs, we have cloned, expressed, purified and characterized IAPs from rat and cynomolgus monkey (rIAP and cIAP respectively) which are important pre-clinical species for drug metabolism studies. The recombinant rat and monkey enzymes expressed in Sf9 insect cells (IAP-Ic) were found to be glycosylated and active. Expression of rat IAP in Escherichia coli (rIAP-Ec) led to ~200-fold loss of activity that was partially recovered by the addition of external Zn(2+) and Mg(2+) ions. Crystal structures of rIAP-Ec and rIAP-Ic were determined and they provide rationale for the discrepancy in enzyme activities. Rat IAP-Ic retains its activity in presence of both Zn(2+) and Mg(2+) whereas activity of most other alkaline phosphatases (APs) including the cIAP was strongly inhibited by excess Zn(2+). Based on our crystal structure, we hypothesized the residue Q317 in rIAP, present within 7 Å of the Mg(2+) at M3, to be important for this difference in activity. The Q317H rIAP and H317Q cIAP mutants showed reversal in effect of Zn(2+), corroborating the hypothesis. Further analysis of the two structures indicated a close linkage between glycosylation and crown domain stability. A triple mutant of rIAP, where all the three putative N-linked glycosylation sites were mutated showed thermal instability and reduced activity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The typical low contrast of tilt-series images, a result of both the need for a low electron dose and the use of conventional defocus phase-contrast imaging, is a challenge for high-quality tomograms. We show that Zernike phase-contrast imaging allows the electron dose to be reduced. This limits movement of gold fiducials during the tilt series, which leads to better alignment and a higher-resolution reconstruction. Contrast is also enhanced, improving visibility of weak features.

This article presents ""gEMfitter"", a highly parallel fast Fourier transform (FFT) EM density fitting program which can exploit the special hardware properties of modern graphics processor units (GPUs) to accelerate both the translational and rotational parts of the correlation search. In particular, by using the GPU's special texture memory hardware to rotate 3D voxel grids, the cost of rotating large 3D density maps is almost completely eliminated. Compared to performing 3D correlations on one core of a contemporary central processor unit (CPU), running gEMfitter on a modern GPU gives up to 26-fold speed-up. Furthermore, using our parallel processing framework, this speed-up increases linearly with the number of CPUs or GPUs used. Thus, it is now possible to use routinely more robust but more expensive 3D correlation techniques. When tested on low resolution experimental cryo-EM data for the GroEL-GroES complex, we demonstrate the satisfactory fitting results that may be achieved by using a locally normalised cross-correlation with a Laplacian pre-filter, while still being up to three orders of magnitude faster than the well-known COLORES program.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We have previously reported the structure of XylE in fully inward open and partially occluded inward open conformations in space groups P61 and C2, respectively. Here we present the crystallization of a third crystal form, P212121 (~4 Å resolution), also representing an inward facing conformation, and analyze all three forms in terms of crystallization conditions and packing. The crystallization conditions were generally very similar with only slight changes needed to favor one form over another, e.g. the presence of lanthanide ions greatly favors C2 over P212121 under otherwise identical conditions. Cadmium was essential for crystallization of all three forms, which indeed all contain a Cd(2+) ion in a crystal packing interface, though surprisingly in different positions. Cadmium was also found to bind to XylE in solution. The diffraction data were highly anisotropic for all forms, reflecting a lack of ordered crystal contacts along one or two of the cell axes. The best diffracting directions thus consistently correlate with the presence of ordered contacts, most of which are metal-mediated. The data presented here highlight the utility of metal ions in membrane protein crystallization and suggest that metal site engineering may be a productive path towards obtaining additional crystal forms of XylE and other membrane proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A key component of this pathway is the four-subunit phenylacetyl-coenzyme A monooxygenase complex (PA-CoA MO, PaaACBE) that catalyzes the insertion of an oxygen in the aromatic ring of PA. This multicomponent enzyme represents a new family of monooxygenases. We have previously determined the structure of the PaaAC subcomplex of catalytic (A) and structural (C) subunits and shown that PaaACB form a stable complex. The PaaB subunit is unrelated to the small subunits of homologous monooxygenases and its role and organization of the PaaACB complex is unknown. From low-resolution crystal structure, electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering we show that the PaaACB complex forms heterohexamers, with a homodimer of PaaB bridging two PaaAC heterodimers. Modeling the interactions of reductase subunit PaaE with PaaACB suggested that a unique and conserved 'lysine bridge' constellation near the Fe-binding site in the PaaA subunit (Lys68, Glu49, Glu72 and Asp126) may form part of the electron transfer path from PaaE to the iron center. The crystal structure of the PaaA(K68Q/E49Q)-PaaC is very similar to the wild-type enzyme structure, but when combined with the PaaE subunit the mutant showed 20-50 times reduced activity, supporting the functional importance of the 'lysine bridge'.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A3G is considered an innate immune effector protein, with a natural capacity to block the replication of retroviruses such as HIV and retrotransposons. However, knowledge about its biophysical properties and mechanism of interaction with DNA are still limited. Oligomerization is one of these unclear issues. What is the stoichiometry of the free protein? What are the factors defining the oligomeric state of the protein? How does the protein oligomerization change upon DNA binding? How stable are protein oligomers? We address these questions here using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly image A3G protein in a free-state and in complexes with DNA, and using time-lapse AFM imaging to characterize the dynamics of A3G oligomers. We found that the formation of oligomers is an inherent property of A3G and that the yield of oligomers depends on the protein concentration. Oligomerization of A3G in complexes with ssDNA follows a similar pattern: the higher the protein concentrations the larger oligomers sizes. The specificity of A3G binding to ssDNA does not depend on stoichiometry. The binding of large A3G oligomers requires a longer ssDNA substrate; therefore, much smaller oligomers form complexes with short ssDNA. A3G oligomers dissociate spontaneously into monomers and this process primarily occurs through a monomer dissociation pathway.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we investigated the biogenesis of the Leishmania flagellum at 0, 4, 6 and 24h of differentiation. Light and electron microscopy observations of the early stages of L. amazonensis differentiation showed that the intermediate forms presented a short and wider flagellum that did not contain a PFR and presented reduced motion. 3D-reconstruction analysis of electron tomograms revealed the presence of vesicles and electron-dense aggregates at the tip of the short flagellum. In the course of differentiation, cells were able to adhere and proliferate with a doubling time of about 6h. The new flagellum emerged from the flagellar pocket around 4h after initiation of cell cycle. Close contact between the flagellar membrane and the flagellar pocket membrane was evident in the intermediate forms. At a later stage of differentiation, intermediate cells exhibited a longer flagellum (shorter than in promastigotes) that contained a PFR and electron dense aggregates in the flagellar matrix. In some cells, PFR profiles were observed inside the flagellar pocket.

The attachment of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an example that has not proven amenable to crystallography, because the binding of GAG analogs disrupts lattice contacts. The interactions of AAV with GAGs are of interest in mediating the cell specificity of AAV-based gene therapy vectors. Previous electron microscopy led to differing conclusions on the exact binding site and the existence of large ligand-induced conformational changes in the virus. Conformational changes are expected during cell entry, but it has remained unclear whether the electron microscopy provided evidence of their induction by GAG-binding. Taking advantage of automated data collection, careful processing and new methods of structure refinement, the structure of AAV-DJ complexed with sucrose octasulfate is determined by electron microscopy difference map analysis to 4.8Å resolution. At this higher resolution, individual sulfate groups are discernible, providing a stereochemical validation of map interpretation, and highlighting interactions with two surface arginines that have been implicated in genetic studies. Conformational changes induced by the SOS are modest and limited to the loop most directly interacting with the ligand. While the resolution attainable will depend on sample order and other factors, there are an increasing number of macromolecular complexes that can be studied by cryo-electron microscopy at resolutions beyond 5Å, for which the approaches used here could be used to characterize the binding of inhibitors and other small molecule effectors when crystallography is not tractable.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Cryo-tomography reveals that the hydrophilic surface is relatively smooth, while the hydrophobic side is highly structured and characterized by the presence of small fibrils, which are similar to those observed on the surfaces of aerial hyphae. Interestingly, our work also provides evidence that chaplins in solution assemble into amyloid fibrils with a distinct morphology.

The skeletonized model is also composed of neuronal processes that could not be classified into the groups. The distribution of these unclassified structures correlates with the distribution of contacts between neuronal processes. This suggests that neurons that cannot be classified into typical structures should play important roles in brain functions. The quantitative description of the brain network provides a basis for structural and statistical analyses of the Drosophila brain. The challenge is to establish a methodology for reconstructing the brain network in a higher-resolution image, leading to a comprehensive understanding of the brain structure.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Those factors, called effector proteins, are involved in the pathogenicity in host cells by interfering with various cellular events. The phytopathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae uses a type III secretion system to inject its effectors, but the functional roles of these proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we determined a crystal structure of XOO4466, an effector from X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and performed a functional analysis. We determined that XOO4466 is similar in sequence to Xanthomonas outer protein Q, a putative nucleoside hydrolase (NH). The overall structure of XOO4466 is homologous to that of NHs, including a metal-binding site, but differs in its oligomeric state and active site topology. Further analysis indicated that antiparallel β-strands commonly found in NHs adjacent to the active site loop are replaced in XOO4466 with a short loop, causing the active site loop to adopt a conformation distinct from that of NHs. Thus, the catalytic residues emanating from the respective active site loop of NHs are absent in the putative active site of XOO4466. Consistent with these structural features, a functional assay indicated that XOO4466 does not exhibit NH activity and possibly catalyzes yet unknown reactions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While properties of both the vertebral body and components of the disc have been extensively studied, limited quantitative data exists describing the microstructure of the vertebral body-intervertebral disc interface in the spine throughout development and degeneration. Quantitative backscattered scanning electron and second harmonic generation confocal imaging were used to collect quantitative data describing the mineral content and collagen fiber orientation across the interface, respectively. Specimens spanned ages 56 days to 84 years and measurements were taken across the vertebral endplate at the outer annulus, inner annulus and nucleus pulposis. In mature and healthy endplates, collagen fibers span the calcified cartilage layer in all regions, including the endplate adjacent to the central nucleus pulposis. We also observed an abrupt transition from high mineral volume fractions (35-50%) to 0% over short distances measuring 3-15 microns in width across the transition from calcified cartilage to unmineralized cartilage. The alignment of collagen fibers at the outer annulus and thickness of the CC layer indicated that collagen fiber mineralization adjacent to the bone may serve to anchor the soft tissue without a gradual change in material properties. Combining backscattered scanning electron microscopy and second harmonic generation imaging on the same sections thus enable a novel assessment of morphology and properties in both mineralized and soft tissues at the vertebral body-intervertebral disc throughout development and aging.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A systematic comparison with other methods further showcased the advantages of this proposed methodology, especially at medium to lower resolutions. Using this method, computational costs and potential overfitting problems are naturally reduced by constraining the search in low-frequency NMA space, where covalent geometry is implicitly maintained.

We are experimenting with phase plates based on silicon chips that have thin windows; such phase plates could be mass-produced and made available at moderate cost. The windows are coated with conductive layers to reduce charging, and this considerably extends the useful life of the phase plates compared to traditional pure-carbon phase plates.

These positions are all loop supporting, primarily CDR1 residues which do not directly contact the antigen. Structure based methods were used with and without consensus sequence information. 30 constructs were made, 24 expressed, and 70% of the designs using consensus sequence information retained binding affinity. Some success maintaining stability with more extreme redesigns suggests a surprising tolerance to mutation, though it often comes at the cost of loss of binding affinity and presumed loop conformation changes. In concordance with the expected need to present an ordered surface for binding, a relationship between decreased affinity and decreased stability was observed.

Characterization of macromolecular complexes in tomograms is nevertheless an extremely challenging task due to the high level of noise, and due to the limited tilt angle that results in missing data in Fourier space. By identifying particles of the same type and averaging their 3D volumes, it is possible to obtain a structure at a more useful resolution for biological interpretation. Currently, classification and averaging of sub-tomograms is limited by the speed of computational methods that optimize alignment between two sub-tomographic volumes. The alignment optimization is hampered by the fact that the missing data in Fourier space has to be taken into account during the rotational search. A similar problem appears in single particle electron microscopy where the random conical tilt procedure may require averaging of volumes with a missing cone in Fourier space. We present a fast implementation of a method guaranteed to find an optimal rotational alignment that maximizes the constrained cross-correlation function (cCCF) computed over the actual overlap of data in Fourier space.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

By bypassing the traditional phosphor scintillator and fiber optic coupling, these cameras have greatly enhanced sensitivity and detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Of the three currently available commercial cameras, the Gatan K2 Summit was designed specifically for counting individual electron events. Counting further enhances the DQE, allows for practical doubling of detector resolution and eliminates noise arising from the variable deposition of energy by each primary electron. While counting has many advantages, undercounting of electrons happens when more than one electron strikes the same area of the detector within the analog readout period (coincidence loss), which influences image quality. In this work, we characterized the K2 Summit in electron counting mode, and studied the relationship of dose rate and coincidence loss and its influence on the quality of counted images. We found that coincidence loss reduces low frequency amplitudes but has no significant influence on the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded image. It also has little influence on high frequency signals. Images of frozen hydrated archaeal 20S proteasome (~700 kDa, D7 symmetry) recorded at the optimal dose rate retained both high-resolution signal and low-resolution contrast and enabled calculating a 3.6 Å three-dimensional reconstruction from only 10,000 particles.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

It is complicated by the relatively small size of the ligand which limits the number of intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, near-perfect geometries between interacting partners are required to achieve high binding affinities. For apolar, rigid small molecules the interactions are dominated by short-range van der Waals forces. As the number of polar groups in the ligand increases, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, cation-π, and π-π interactions gain importance. These partial covalent interactions are longer ranged, and additionally, their strength depends on the environment (e.g. solvent exposure). To assess the current state of protein-small molecule interface design, we benchmark the popular computer algorithm Rosetta on a diverse set of 43 protein-ligand complexes. On average, we achieve sequence recoveries in the binding site of 59% when the ligand is allowed limited reorientation, and 48% when the ligand is allowed full reorientation. When simulating the redesign of a protein binding site, sequence recovery among residues that contribute most to binding was 52% when slight ligand reorientation was allowed, and 27% when full ligand reorientation was allowed.

Group O:54 is unique among the serogroups belonging to the genus Salmonella. Normally, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the repeating units of somatic antigen are encoded by a set of genes, located in the region of the bacterial chromosome. Expression of O54 factor is associated with the presence of the plasmid. Factor O54 can be lost spontaneously in the subcultures of some serotypes. In these cases, the O54 negative variants become indistinguishable from the serotypes classified in other groups. We noticed lower activity of LPS-u O:3,54 with rabbit sera against antigens O:3, when compared with the activity of sera anti-A:54, which may indicate a partial inhibition of the expression of factor O:3 on the surface of the bacterial cell.

This calculation represents an average over the entire reconstructed volume. In practice, however, substantial local variations in resolution may occur, either from intrinsic properties of the specimen or for technical reasons such as a non-isotropic distribution of viewing orientations. To address this issue, we propose the use of a space-frequency representation, the short-space Fourier transform, to assess the quality of a density map, voxel-by-voxel, i.e. by local resolution mapping. In this approach, the experimental volume is divided into small subvolumes and the resolution determined for each of them. It is illustrated in applications both to model data and to experimental density maps. Regions with lower-than-average resolution may be mobile components or ones with incomplete occupancy or result from multiple conformational states. To improve the interpretability of reconstructions, we propose an adaptive filtering approach that reconciles the resolution to which individual features are calculated with the results of the local resolution map.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The origin of biomineralization as a scientific discipline may be tracked to the 19th century, with early work on bone and on sponge spicules and the recognition that organic molecules may influence the growth of inorganic crystals. But the blooming of general interest in biomineralization really started in the second half of the 20th century. Steve Weiner first heard about biomineralization in the early seventies from a lecture of Heinz Lowenstam in Jerusalem, and decided to join Heinz in Caltech for his PhD: since then, Steve never ceased to be fascinated by biomineralization and to work in this field, and with good reason. Having worked with Steve for many years, in the field and in the lab, we know and share his passion and excitement. Heinz said in an interview with Heidi Aspaturian in 1989: ‘‘I am pleased with one thing: that I myself, with the help of my former students, Steve in particular, have gotten people who work on. . . bone and teeth to look at their work in the broader context of biomineralization. I have tried to show them that their work is only a small part of the whole biomineralization process, and that if one looks at the broader picture and gets information on how these processes work, one might get feedback in terms of better understanding what is going on...’’. Biomineralization is the science of how inorganic and also organic substances are deposited and controlled by living systems and is, thus, inherently multidisciplinary. In 1989, Steve and Heinz listed in the introduction of their book ‘‘On biomineralization’’ the scientific disciplines that are touched by biomineralization: evolution, paleontology, oceanography, sedimentology, materials, dentistry, orthopedics and archeology. Today we should at least add to that list biomimetics, mechanics and of course structural biology. Starting from the 1970s and to this day, the developments in molecular biology provided an increasing amount of knowledge on the macromolecules involved in the interactions with, and the control of, the mineral phases. The advances in this area were predictably much slower than in other areas of biology, because of the multitude and the complexity of the macromolecules involved, and because of the difficulties emanating from their association with mineral: there is still much to do. The development of new characterization tools and groundbreaking advances in electron microscopy provide us today with insights into what occurs in mineralizing tissues at the supra-molecular level under close to physiological conditions. New sophisticated spectroscopic techniques provide us with the possibility to obtain fingerprints of minerals and of their development, of organic matrix profiles, of the interfaces and interphases between them at nanometer resolu-",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this work, we present a novel particle quality assessment and sorting method that can separate most erroneously picked particles from correct ones. The proposed method is based on multivariate statistical analysis of a particle set that has been picked previously using any automatic or manual approach. The new method uses different sets of particle descriptors, which are morphology-based, histogram-based and signal to noise analysis based.

In untreated tablets, SEM and AFM data show that vermiculations correspond to aligned and fused aragonite nanogloblules, which are partly surrounded by thin organic pellicles. EBSD mapping of the surfaces of tablets indicates that the vermiculations are invariably parallel to the crystallographic a-axis of aragonite and that the triangles are aligned with the b-axis and correspond to the advance of the {010} faces during the growth of the tablet. According to our interpretation, the vermiculations appear because organic molecules during growth are expelled from the a-axis, where the Ca-CO3 bonds are the shortest. In this way, the subunits forming nacre merge uninterruptedly, forming chains parallel to the a-axis, whereas the organic molecules are expelled to the sides of these chains. Hourglass patterns would be produced by preferential adsorption of organic molecules along the {010}, as compared to the {100} faces. A model is presented for the nanostructure of nacre tablets. SEM and EBSD data also show the existence within the tablets of nanocrystalline units, which are twinned on {110} with the rest of the tablet.

Many of them have been developed to bind to folded proteins, yet cellular networks for signaling and protein trafficking often depend on binding to unfolded regions of proteins. This type of binding can thus be well described as a peptide-protein interaction. In this review, we compare different peptide-binding scaffolds, highlighting that armadillo repeat proteins (ArmRP) offer an attractive modular system, as they bind a stretch of extended peptide in a repeat-wise manner. Instead of generating each new binding molecule by an independent selection, preselected repeats - each complementary to a piece of the target peptide - could be designed and assembled on demand into a new protein, which then binds the prescribed complete peptide. Stacked armadillo repeats (ArmR), each typically consisting of 42 amino acids arranged in three α-helices, build an elongated superhelical structure which enables binding of peptides in extended conformation. A consensus-based design approach, complemented with molecular dynamics simulations and rational engineering, resulted in well-expressed monomeric proteins with high stability.

However, the conformational state and the preparation of the sample are factors that play a critical role in the ultimate attainable resolution. In some cases extensive analysis at the microscope of a sample under different conditions is required to derive the optimal acquisition conditions. Currently this analysis is limited to raw micrographs, thus conveying only limited information on the structure of the complex. We are developing a computing system that generates a three-dimensional reconstruction from a single micrograph acquired under cryogenic and low dose conditions, and containing particles with icosahedral symmetry. The system provides the microscopist with immediate structural information from a sample while it is in the microscope and during the preliminary acquisition stage. The system is designed to run without user intervention on a multi-processor computing resource and integrates all the processing steps required for the analysis. Tests performed on experimental data sets show that the probability of obtaining a reliable reconstruction from one micrograph is primarily determined by the quality of the sample, with success rates close to 100% when sample conditions are optimal, and decreasing to about 60% when conditions are sub-optimal. The time required to generate a reconstruction depends significantly on the diameter of the particles, and in most instances takes about 1min.

Raltegravir was the first integrase inhibitor approved by the FDA for antiretroviral treatment. HIV patients on raltegravir containing regimens often develop drug resistance mutations at residue 140 and 148 in the catalytic 140's loop resulting in a 5-10 fold decrease in susceptibility to raltegravir. Obtaining crystallographic structure information on the Q148H/R, G140S/A primary and secondary mutations has been elusive. Using 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations, we present a detailed analysis of the structural changes induced by these mutations. The formation frequency of a transient helix in the catalytic 140's loop is increased and the length of this helix is extended from 3-residues to 4 in the mutants relative to the wild type. This helix causes reduced flexibility in the protein active site and therefore serves as a gating mechanism restricting the access of raltegravir to the integrase binding pocket. These results suggest that resistance to raltegravir occurs through a common mechanism of altering the formation frequency of transient secondary structures such as α2 and β5 in addition to the conformational changes in the 140's loop therefore decreasing the flexibility of the HIV-1 integrase protein. The reduced integrase flexibility serves as a mechanism of resistance to raltegravir.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Due to this important role in the structure-function relationship of bone, osteocytes and the spaces they occupy (lacunae) are of increasing interest. Changes in lacunae with age are of particular interest in women since they are more susceptible to bone loss and fragility associated with senescent diseases including osteoporosis. This study's purpose was to test whether differences exist in lacunar density (lacunae/mm(3) of bone), orientation and morphology in the cortex of adult women spanning the human lifespan. Anterior blocks from the femoral shaft from 30 women aged 20-86years were imaged by synchrotron-radiation micro-CT. No significant relation between lacunar density and age was detected. A significant reduction in lacunar volume with age (p<0.001) was observed, alongside changes in lacunar morphology. When divided into two groups (<50 and >50years) the younger group's lacunae were ∼30% larger and were flatter (p<0.001) and less equant (spherical) (p<0.001). To our knowledge the observation that lacunar volume and morphology change over the human lifespan is novel, potentially resulting from preferential surface infilling within the extracellular space. The functional impact of this infilling is unclear but such a change in scale likely impacts the mechanosensing function of the osteocyte network. Limitations in resolution prevented us from assessing if this infilling is associated with disruption of the canaliculi. This hypothesis warrants further investigation as, if confirmed, it would represent a profound negative impact on the osteocyte network and may provide new insights into age-related bone loss.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition to its importance in veterinary medicine, this parasite is also a good representative of one the earliest eukaryotic cells available for study. T. foetus contains organelles that are common to all eukaryotic cells as well as uncommon cell structures such as hydrogenosomes and a complex and elaborate cytoskeleton that constitutes the mastigont system. The mastigont system is mainly formed by several proteinaceous structures that are associated with basal bodies, the pelta-axostylar complex and the costa.

However, precisely visualizing cellulose orientation in the plant cell wall has ever been a challenge due to the small size of the cellulose microfibrils and the complex network of polymers in the plant cell wall. X-ray diffraction is one of the most frequently used methods for analyzing cellulose orientation in single cells and plant tissues, but the interpretation of the diffraction images is complex. Traditionally, circular or square cells and Gaussian orientation of the cellulose microfibrils have been assumed to elucidate cellulose orientation from the diffraction images. However, the complex tissue structures of common model plant systems such as Arabidopsis or aspen (Populus) require a more sophisticated approach. We present an evaluation procedure which takes into account the precise cell geometry and is able to deal with complex microfibril orientation distributions. The evaluation procedure reveals the entire orientation distribution of the cellulose microfibrils, reflecting different orientations within the multi-layered cell wall. By analyzing aspen wood and Arabidopsis stems we demonstrate the versatility of this method and show that simplifying assumptions on geometry and orientation distributions can lead to errors in the calculated microfibril orientation pattern.

Their use in biological contexts, however, has been severely restricted due to their high degree of self-association, and its attendant photoquenching, in aqueous environments. To this end we report the rational redesign of a de novo four helix bundle di-heme binding protein into a heme and Zinc(II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc) dyad in which the ZnPc is electronically and photonically isolated. The redesign required transformation of the homodimeric protein into a single chain four helix bundle and the addition of a negatively charge sulfonate ion to the ZnPc macrocycle. To explore the role of topology on ZnPc binding two constructs were made and the resulting differences in affinity can be explained by steric interference of the newly added connecting loop. Singular binding of ZnPc was verified by absorption, fluorescence, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy. The engineering guidelines determined here, which enable the simple insertion of a monomeric ZnPc binding site into an artificial helical bundle, are a robust starting point for the creation of functional photoactive nanodevices.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Cryo-electron microscopy of the T2SS secretin GspD revealed previously the dodecameric cylindrical architecture of secretins, and crystal structures of periplasmic secretin domains showed a modular domain organization. However, no high-resolution experimental data has as yet been provided about how the entire T2SS secretin or its domains are organized in a cylindrical fashion. Here we present a crystal structure of the N0 domain of the T2SS secretin GspD from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli containing a helix with 12 subunits per turn. The helix has an outer diameter of ∼125Å and a pitch of only 24Å which suggests a model of a cylindrical dodecameric N0 ring whose dimensions correspond with the cryo-electron microscopy map of Vibrio cholerae GspD. The N0 domain is known to interact with the HR domain of the inner membrane T2SS protein GspC. When the new N0 ring model is combined with the known N0·HR crystal structure, a dodecameric double-ring of twelve N0-HR heterodimers is obtained. In contrast, the previously observed compact N0-N1 GspD module is not compatible with the N0 ring. Interestingly, a N0-N1 T3SS homolog is compatible with forming a N0-N1 dodecameric ring, due to a different N0-vs-N1 orientation. This suggests that the dodecameric N0 ring is an important feature of T2SS secretins with periplasmic domains undergoing considerable motions during exoprotein translocation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Trauma-associated cartilage fractures occur in children and adolescents with clinically significant incidence. Several studies investigated biomechanical injury by compressive forces but the injury-related stress has not been investigated extensively. In this study, we hypothesized that the biomechanical stress occurring during compressive injury predetermines the biomechanical, biochemical, and structural consequences. We specifically investigated whether the stress-vs-time signal correlated with the injurious damage and may allow prediction of cartilage matrix fracturing.


METHODS
Superficial and deeper zones disks (SZDs, DZDs; immature bovine cartilage) were biomechanically characterized, injured (50% compression, 100%/s strain-rate), and re-characterized. Correlations of the quantified functional, biochemical and histological damage with biomechanical parameters were zonally investigated.


RESULTS
Injured SZDs exhibited decreased dynamic stiffness (by 93.04±1.72%), unresolvable equilibrium moduli, structural damage (2.0±0.5 on a 5-point-damage-scale), and 1.78-fold increased sGAG loss. DZDs remained intact. Measured stress-vs-time-curves during injury displayed 4 distinct shapes, which correlated with histological damage (p<0.001), loss of dynamic stiffness and sGAG (p<0.05). Damage prediction in a blinded experiment using stress-vs-time grades was 100%-correct and sensitive to differentiate single/complex matrix disruptions. Correlations of the dissipated energy and maximum stress rise with the extent of biomechanical and biochemical damage reached significance when SZDs and DZDs were analyzed as zonal composites but not separately.


CONCLUSIONS
The biomechanical stress that occurs during compressive injury predetermines the biomechanical, biochemical, and structural consequences and, thus, the structural and functional damage during cartilage fracturing. A novel biomechanical method based on the interpretation of compressive yielding allows the accurate prediction of the extent of structural damage.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Collagen(s) are the only known ligand for DDR1. We have previously reported that collagen stimulation leads to oligomerization of the full length receptor. In this study we investigated the effect of oligomerization of the DDR1 extracellular domain (ECD) pre and post ligand binding. Solid phase binding assays showed that oligomers of recombinant DDR1-Fc bound more strongly to collagen compared to dimeric DDR1-Fc alone. In addition, DDR1-Fc itself could oligomerize upon in-vitro binding to collagen when examined using atomic force microscopy. Inhibition of dynamin mediated receptor endocytosis could prevent ligand induced endocytosis of DDR1b-YFP in live cells. However inhibition of receptor endocytosis did not affect DDR1 oligomerization. In summary our results demonstrate that DDR1 ECD plays a crucial role in receptor oligomerization which mediates high-affinity interactions with its ligand.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Furthermore, prisms in Pf and Pm are harder than in any other calcite prisms analyzed, their nanoparticles are smaller, and the angle spread is strongly correlated with hardness in all shells that form calcitic prismatic layers. One can hypothesize a causal relationship of these correlated parameters: greater angle spread may confer greater hardness and resistance to wear, thus providing Pf and Pm with a structural advantage in their environment.

Recent evidence implicates SM50 in the stabilization of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Here, we investigate the molecular interactions of SM50 and CaCO3 by investigating the function of three major domains of SM50 as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) fusion proteins - a C-type lectin domain (CTL), a glycine rich region (GRR) and a proline rich region (PRR). Under various mineralization conditions, we find that SUMO-CTL is monomeric and influences CaCO3 mineralization, SUMO-GRR aggregates into large protein superstructures and SUMO-PRR modifies the early CaCO3 mineralization stages as well as growth. The combination of these mineralization and self-assembly properties of the major domains synergistically enable the full-length SM50 to fulfill functions of constructing the organic spicule matrix as well as performing necessary mineralization activities such as Ca(2+) ion recruitment and organization to allow for proper growth and development of the mineralized larval sea urchin spicule.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie binding specificity is of particular interest to synthetic biology, e.g. the engineering of biosensors with de novo ligand affinities. Promising scaffolds for such biosensors are the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) due to their ligand-mediated structural change that can be translated into a physically measurable signal. In this study we focused on the two homologous polyamine binding proteins PotF and PotD. Despite their structural similarity, PotF and PotD have different binding specificities for the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. To elucidate how specificity is determined, we grafted the binding site of PotD onto PotF. The introduction of 7 mutations in the first shell of the binding pocket leads to a swap in the binding profile as confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the 1.7Å crystal structure of the new variant complexed with spermidine reveals the interactions of the specificity determining residues including a defined water network. Altogether our study shows that specificity is encoded in the first shell residues of the PotF binding pocket and that transplantation of these residues allows the swap of the binding specificity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The spatial modulations can be interpreted to represent cristae/matrix distributions. The temporal fluctuations of fluorescence vary within 0.3-3s. Because most peak positions of IMP fluorescence remain stationary up to at least several minutes, temporal intensity modulations may result from varying emissions related to the degree of excitation and/or represent wobbling of cristae, i.e. lateral movements, bending or size changes. Modulations by noise and non-saturated excitation have been reduced by 3 steps of deconvolution followed by averaging 4 images. This allowed a final temporal resolution of 150ms.

The in vivo environment either intracellular or intercellular, contains many components that modulate both the activity of the ions which associate to form the mineral, as well as the activity and structure of the crowded water. Most of the studies about the mechanism of mineralization, that is, the detailed pathways by which the mineral ions proceed from solution to crystal state, have been carried out in relatively dilute solutions and clean solutions. These studies have considered both thermodynamic and kinetic controls. Most have not considered the water itself. Is the water a passive bystander, or is it intimately a participant in the mineral ion densification reaction? A wide range of experiments show that the mineralization pathways proceed through a series of densification stages with intermediates, such as a ""dense liquid"" phase and the prenucleation clusters that form within it. This is in contrast to the idea of a single step phase transition, but consistent with the Gibbs concept of discontinuous phase transitions from supersaturated mother liquor to crystal. Further changes in the water structure at every surface and interface during densification guides the free energy trajectory leading to the crystalline state.

While HS and UHS KAPs are known to function in disulfide bond crosslinking, the function of HGT KAPs remains unknown. To clarify the function as well as the binding partners of HGT KAPs, we prepared KAP8.1 and other KAP family proteins, the trichocyte intermediate filament proteins (IFP) K85 and K35, the head domain of K85, and the C subdomain of desmoplakin C-terminus (DPCT-C) and investigated the interactions between them in vitro. Western blot analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicate that KAP8.1 binds to the head domain of K85, which is helically aligned around the axis of the intermediate filament (IF). From these results and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of bundled filament complex in vitro, we propose that the helical arrangement of IFs found in the orthocortex, which is uniquely distributed on the convex fiber side of the hair, is regulated by KAP8.1. Structure-dependent binding of DPCT-C to trichocyte IFP was confirmed by Western blotting, ITC, and circular dichroism. Moreover, DPCT-C also binds to some HGT KAPs.

HutP is such a regulatory protein that regulates the expression of the histidine utilization (hut) operon in Bacillus subtilis by binding to cis-acting regulatory sequences in hut mRNAs. During the anti-termination process, l-histidine and a divalent ion are required for hutP to bind to the specific sequence within the hut mRNA. Our previous crystal structure of the HutP-l-histidine-Mg(2+)-RNA ternary complex demonstrated that the l-histidine ligand and Mg(2+) bind together such that the backbone nitrogen and carboxyl oxygen of l-histidine coordinate with Mg(2+). In addition to the Mg(2+), other divalent ions are also known to efficiently support the l-histidine-dependent anti-termination of the hut operon, and the best divalent ion is Zn(2+). In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the HutP-l-histidine-Zn(2+) complex and found that the orientation of l-histidine coordinated to Zn(2+) is reversed relative to that of l-histidine coordinated to Mg(2+), i.e., the imidazole side chain nitrogen of l-histidine coordinates to Zn(2+).

SEM results indicated distinctive macro- and micro-structural organizations of the skeleton for each species, likely resulting from a genetically dictated variation in the control exerted on their formation. However, most skeletons investigated shared submicron to nano-scale morphological and crystallographical patterns: (1) single-crystal fibers and bundles were composed of 20 to 100nm large submicronic grains, the smallest structural units, (2) nano-scale likely organic material occurred both within and between these structural units, (3) {110} micro-twin planes were observed along aragonitic fibers, and (4) individual fibers or small bundles protruded from the external growing surface of skeletons. This comparative mineralogical study of phylogenetically distant species brings further evidence to recent biomineralization models already proposed for sponges, corals, mollusks, brachiopods and echinoderms and to the hypothesis of the universal and ancestral character of such mechanisms in Metazoa.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Attachment of GAS to host cells depends in large part on pili. These assemblies are built from multiple covalently linked subunits of a backbone protein (FctA), which forms the shaft of the pilus, and two minor pilin proteins, FctB anchoring the pilus to the cell wall and Cpa functioning as the adhesin at the tip. Polymerisation of the pilin subunits is mediated by a specific sortase, which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds linking successive subunits. An additional gene, SipA, is also essential for GAS pilus polymerisation, but its function remains undefined. Here we report the crystal structure of a truncated SipA protein from GAS, determined at 1.67Å resolution. The structure reveals that SipA has the same core fold as the Escherichia coli type-I signal peptidase (SPase-I), but has a much smaller non-catalytic domain. The truncated protein, which lacks 9 N-terminal residues, forms an arm-swapped dimer in which the C-terminal β-strand of each monomer crosses over to interact with an N-terminal strand from the other monomer. In addition, there is no peptide binding cleft and significant differences in the putative membrane association region.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Both proteoglycans consist of a core protein and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, but quantitative information regarding the precise role of the protein and GAG moieties in regulating collagen structure is still limited. In this study, we used AFM imaging and a model system of aligned collagen I nanofibrils to investigate the role of lumican and decorin on collagen I fibril structure with high resolution. When co-assembled with collagen I, recombinant lumican or decorin proteins lacking the GAG chains decreased collagen fibril width to values below <100nm and increased interfibrillar spacing in a dose-dependent manner. At lower concentrations, lumican appeared to have a stabilizing effect on newly-formed collagen fibrils, while at higher concentrations both lumican and decorin inhibited collagen fibrillogenesis. GAG-containing decorin also increased interfibrillar spacing, decreased fibril width and ultimately inhibited fibrillogenesis, but these effects required lower concentrations compared to recombinant decorin, indicating that the decorin core protein alone cannot compensate for the full regulatory and structural contribution of the GAG chain during collagen I fibrillogenesis. Using a 2D autocorrelation approach, we furthermore analyzed and compared the effects of recombinant and glycosylated decorin on collagen ultrastructure, providing a quantitative measure for the observed structural differences. AFM analysis of ordered fibrillar collagen arrays in combination with quantitative autocorrelation image analysis thus provides a useful tool for investigating SLRP-dependent nanoscale effects on collagen fibril structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The crystal structure of the binary complex of APH(4)-Ia with hygB was recently reported. To characterize substrate recognition by the enzyme, we determined the crystal structure of the ternary complex of non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP and hygB with wild-type, thermostable Hph mutant Hph5, and apo-mutant enzyme forms. The comparison between the ternary complex and apo structures revealed that Hph undergoes domain movement upon binding of AMP-PNP and hygB. This was about half amount of the case of APH(9)-Ia. We also determined the crystal structures of mutants in which the conserved, catalytically important residues Asp198 and Asn203, and the non-conserved Asn202, were converted to Ala, revealing the importance of Asn202 for catalysis. Hph5 contains five amino acid substitutions that alter its thermostability by 16°C; its structure revealed that 4/5 mutations in Hph5 are located in the hydrophobic core and appear to increase thermostability by strengthening hydrophobic interactions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this study we applied for this purpose a novel atmospheric scanning electron microscope that allows the investigation of CaCO3 particle formation in solution under atmospheric conditions with a resolution of approximately 10nm. Furthermore it permits the in situ observation of the dynamics of crystal evolution. With this tool the precipitation of CaCO3 was studied in the absence and presence of additives, namely poly(acrylic acid) and poly(styrene sulfonate-co-maleic acid) which are known to influence the crystal growth rate and morphology. We determined particle growth rates and investigated the formation and dissolution dynamics of an observed transient phase, believed to be amorphous calcium carbonate. This technique also enabled us to study the depletion zones, areas of lower intensity due to reduced ion concentrations. Ion flux rates were obtained from the depletion zone width, which amounted to several μm assuming the formation and dissolution dynamics of amorphous calcium carbonate being the rate determining process. This assumption was confirmed since the obtained fluxes were found to be in good agreement with fluxes derived from the experimentally observed crystal growth rates.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

As the workflow is still challenging and time consuming, it is important to be able to determine the integrity and suitability (cells vs. no cells; vitreous vs. crystalline) of the lamellas. Here we present an in situ method that tests both conditions by using the cryo-Scanning Electron Microscope (cryo-SEM) in transmission mode (TSEM; Transmission Scanning Electron Microscope) once the FIB-made lamella is ready. Cryo-TSEM imaging of unstained cells yields strong contrast, enabling direct imaging of material present in the lamellas. In addition, orientation contrast is shown to be suitable for distinguishing crystalline lamellas from vitreous lamellas. Tilting the stage a few degrees results in changes of contrast between ice grains as a function of the tilt angle, whereas the contrast of areas with vitreous ice remains unchanged as a function of the tilt angle. This orientation contrast has subsequently been validated by cryo-Electron BackScattered Diffraction (EBSD) in transmission mode. Integration of the presented method is discussed and the role it can play in future developments for a new and innovative all-in-one cryo-FIB-SEM life sciences instrument.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Herein, a hybrid method that combines electron microscopy (EM) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is described and used to localize the C-terminus of the second TFIIF subunit (Tfg2) in the architecture of RNAPII-TFIIF. In the first stage, a poly-histidine tag appended to the Tfg2 C-terminus was labeled with nickel-NTA nanogold and a seven-step single particle EM protocol was devised to obtain the region accessible by the nanogold in 3D, suggesting the Tfg2 C-terminus is proximal to the clamp of RNAPII. Next, the C-termini of the Rpb2 and the Rpb4 subunits of RNAPII, adjacent to the clamp, were selected for placing FRET satellites to enable the nano-positioning (NP) analysis, by which the localization precision was improved such that the Tfg2 C-terminus was found to dwell on the clamp ridge but could move to the clamp top during transcription. Because the tag receptive to the EM or FRET probes can be readily introduced to any protein subunit, this hybrid approach is generally applicable to complement cryo-EM study of many protein complexes to nanometer precision.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Talin contains an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain (the head) linked to a flexible rod comprised of 13 amphipathic helical bundles (R1-R13) that terminate in a C-terminal helix (DD) that forms an anti-parallel dimer. We derived a three-dimensional structural model of full-length talin at a resolution of approximately 2.5nm using EM reconstruction of full-length talin and the known shapes of the individual domains and inter-domain angles as derived from small angle X-ray scattering. Talin adopts a compact conformation consistent with a dimer in which the two talin rods form a donut-shaped structure, with the two talin heads packed side by side occupying the hole at the center of this donut. In this configuration, the integrin binding site in the head domain and the actin-binding site at the carboxy-terminus of the rod are masked, implying that talin must unravel before it can support integrin activation and engage the actin cytoskeleton.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

DsbC has a V-shaped dimeric structure with two domains, and Cys98 in the C-terminal domain attacks inappropriate disulfide bonds in substrate proteins due to its high nucleophilic activity. In this article, we present the crystal structure of DsbC from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. We evaluated the conserved residues Asp95 and Arg125, which are located close to Cys98. The mutation of Asp95 or Arg125 abolished the disulfide isomerase activity of DsbC in an in vitro assay using a protein substrate, and the R125A mutation significantly reduced the chaperone activity for the substrate RNase I in vivo. Furthermore, a comparative analysis suggested that the conformation of Arg125 varies depending on the packing or protein-protein interactions. Based on these findings, we suggest that Asp95 and Arg125 modulate the pKa of Cys98 during catalysis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we present a forward model that accounts for the specimen's scattering properties, microscope optics, and detector response. The specimen interaction potential is calculated with the isolated atom superposition approximation (IASA) and extended with the influences of solvent's dielectric and ionic properties as well as the molecular electrostatic distribution. We account for an effective charge redistribution via the Poisson-Boltzmann approach and find that the IASA-based potential forms the dominant part of the interaction potential, as the contribution of the redistribution is less than 10%. The electron wave is propagated through the specimen by a multislice approach and the influence of the optics is included via the contrast transfer function. We incorporate the detective quantum efficiency of the camera due to the difference between signal and noise transfer characteristics, instead of using only the modulation transfer function. The full model was validated against experimental images of 20S proteasome, hemoglobin, and GroEL. The simulations adequately predict the effects of phase contrast, changes due to the integrated electron flux, thickness, inelastic scattering, detective quantum efficiency and acceleration voltage.

It is a highly specialized form of cross striated muscles, and its peculiar features include the IFM-specific isoform of troponin-I (troponin-H or TnH) with an unusually long Pro-Ala-rich extension at the C-terminus. Although we have shown that this extension does not directly take part in SA, questions remain as to what its real role is and why it is expressed only in IFM. Here we explored the structural role of the extension, be comparing X-ray diffraction patterns and electron micrographs of bumblebee IFM fibers before and after enzymatic removal of the extension. The removal had a dramatic effect on diffraction patterns: In IFMs in general, the equatorial 2,0 reflection is much stronger than the 1,1 reflection, but after removal, their intensities became almost equal (stronger 1,1 is a feature of vertebrate skeletal muscle). Electron micrographs revealed that a substantial fraction of the thin filaments showed a tendency to move towards the vertebrate position (the trigonal position between three thick filaments), while the rest of the thin filaments remained in their original insect position (midway between two neighboring thick filaments). Therefore, one of the roles of the extension is suggested to keep the filament lattice in the correct configuration for IFM. This insect-type lattice structure is preserved among IFMs from varied insect orders but not in body muscles, suggesting that the maintenance of this lattice structure is important for flight functions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The results for the virus proteins are inline with previous observations based on biochemical, genetic and structural studies but go further, since by providing coherent alignments between sets of molecules with marked structural distortion, they facilitate the marshaling of arguments for or against homology.

Assembly and mineralization of full-length native (P173) and recombinant (rP172) porcine amelogenins were studied by cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryoTEM). The cryoTEM revealed that both native and recombinant porcine amelogenins undergo step-wise self-assembly. Although the overall structural organization of P173 and rP172 oligomers was similar and resembled oligomers of murine recombinant amelogenin rM179, there were subtle differences suggesting that a single phosphorylated serine present in P173 might affect amelogenin self-assembly. Our mineralization studies demonstrated that both P173 and rP172 oligomers stabilize initial mineral clusters. Importantly, however, rP172 regulated the organization of initial mineral clusters into linear chains and guided the formation of parallel arrays of elongated mineral particles, which are the hallmark of enamel structural organization. These results are similar to those obtained previously using full-length recombinant murine amelogenin (Fang et al., 2011a). In contrast to that seen with rP172, phosphorylated P173 strongly inhibits mineralization for extended periods of time. We propose that these differences might be due to the differences in the structural organization and charge distribution between P173 and rP172. Overall our studies indicate that self-assembly of amelogenin and the mechanisms of its control over mineralization might be universal across different mammalian species.

The remaining 80% are clathrin ""baskets"", presumably artifactual assembly products. Polyhedral models were built for 54 distinct coat geometries. In true coated vesicles (CVs), most vesicles are offset to one side, leaving a crescent of interstitial space between the coat and the membrane for adaptor proteins and other components. The latter densities are fewer on the membrane-proximal side, which may represent the last part of the vesicle to bud off. A small number of densities - presumably cargo proteins - are associated with the interior surface of the vesicles. The clathrin coat, adaptor proteins, and vesicle membrane contribute almost all of the mass of a CV, with most cargoes accounting for only a few percent.

This process leads to the formation of a mineral/organic composite and it is believed that the development of the nano- and microstructure of the mineral phase is highly sensitive to the growth conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of large-scale (10×30μm) focused ion beam (FIB) prepared lamellae was performed on adult and juvenile scleractinian coral skeleton specimens.

To the best of our knowledge, for the first time the observed microstructure could be directly correlated with the dark/bright bands characteristic of the diurnal growth cycle. We hypothesize that this mineral structure sequence and alignment in the adult specimen is linked to the photosynthetic diurnal cycle of the zooxanthellea regulating the oxygen levels and organic molecule transport to the calcifying medium.

In particular, introducing crosslinking reagents into antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) should provide a means to covalently crosslink residues at the antibody-antigen interface. Unfortunately, finding the optimum position for crosslinking two proteins is often a matter of iterative guessing, even when the interface is known in atomic detail. Computer-aided antibody design can potentially greatly restrict the number of variants that must be explored in order to identify successful crosslinking sites. We have therefore used Rosetta to guide the introduction of an oxidizable crosslinking NCAA, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), into the CDRs of the anti-protective antigen scFv antibody M18, and have measured crosslinking to its cognate antigen, domain 4 of the anthrax protective antigen. Computed crosslinking distance, solvent accessibility, and interface energetics were three factors considered that could impact the efficiency of l-DOPA-mediated crosslinking. In the end, 10 variants were synthesized, and crosslinking efficiencies were generally 10% or higher, with the best variant crosslinking to 52% of the available antigen. The results suggest that computational analysis can be used in a pipeline for engineering crosslinking antibodies.

It is well known that in corals the mineral deposition occurs in a biological confined nucleation site, but it is still unclear to what extent the calcification is controlled by OM molecules. Hence, the shape, size and organization of skeletal crystals from the fiber level through the colony architecture, were also attributed to factors as diverse as nucleation site mineral supersaturation and environmental factors in the habitat. In this work the OMs were extracted from the skeleton of three colonial corals, Acropora digitifera, Lophelia pertusa and Montipora caliculata. A. digitifera has a higher calcification rate than the other two species. OM molecules were characterized and their CaCO3 mineralization activity was evaluated by experiments of overgrowth on coral skeletons and of precipitation from solutions containing OM soluble and insoluble fractions and magnesium ions. The precipitates were characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The results showed that the OM molecules of the three coral share similar features, but differ from those associated with mollusk shells. However, A. digitifera OM shows peculiarities from those from L. pertusa and M. caliculata. The CaCO3 overgrowth and precipitation experiments confirm the singularity of A. digitifera OM molecules as mineralizers. Moreover, their comparison indicates that only specific molecules are involved in the polymorphism control and suggests that when the whole extracted materials are used the OM's main effect is on the control of particles' shape and morphology.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In characterizing the structure of these spicules, using state-of-the-art techniques such as synchrotron X-ray diffraction and synchrotron micro- and nanotomography, we observed a continuous structural pattern from the macro down to the micro, nano, and atomic scales. We show that the spicules demonstrate a unique architecture composed of micron-sized, hexagonally faceted thorns organized in partial spirals along the cylinder-like polycrystalline body of the spicule, and tilted from it at an angle of about 26°. This morphological orientation coincides with the crystallographic orientation relationship between each thorn and the polycrystals within the spicule. Hence the entire spicule grows along the [011] direction of vaterite while the individual thorns grow along the [001] direction. This, together with the presence of both inter- and intra-crystalline organic phases, beautifully displays the organism's ability to achieve perfect control of mineralization biologically while employing an unstable polymorph of calcium carbonate: vaterite.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This conformational change in quaternary structure is triggered by a local structural change of the unique α5 helix, and by moving each loop P into an open conformation to accommodate incoming ligands. Furthermore, subtle rearrangement of the dimer interface triggers movement of all subunits, and consequently, the bent structure of the CBSX2 dimer becomes a flat structure. This reshaping of the structure upon complex formation with adenosine-containing ligand provides evidence that ligand-induced conformational reorganization of antiparallel CBS domains is an important regulatory mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In particular, bone is permeated by a vast number of channels (the lacunar-canalicular system), that reduce the stiffness and, more importantly, the strength of the bone that they permeate. These consequences are presumably a price worth paying for the ability of the lacunar-canalicular system to detect changes in the strain environment within the bone material and, when deleterious, to trigger processes like modeling or remodeling which 'rectify' it. Here we review the size and density of the various types of cavities in bone, and discuss their effect on the mechanical properties of cortical bone. In this respect the bones of advanced teleost fish species (probably the majority of all vertebrate species) are an unsolved conundrum because they lack bone cells (and therefore lacunae and canaliculi) in their skeleton. Yet, despite being acellular, some of these fish can undergo considerable remodeling in at least some parts of their skeleton. We address, but do not solve this mystery.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

For biological specimens, charging and movement are most severe when they are suspended in an insulating layer of vitreous ice, which is otherwise optimal for preserving hydrated specimens in a near native state. We image biological specimens, including a single particle protein complex and a lipid-enveloped virus in thin, vitreous ice films over suspended sheets of unmodified graphene.

Here we show that a substantial portion of the cortical bone of mature rats is primary endochondral bone, consisting of a disorganized arrangement of mineralized collagen fibers. We characterize the structure and mechanical properties of the cortical bone of the rat. We show that the cortical bone consists of two architecturally distinct regions. One region, consisting of well-organized circumferential lamellae (CLB), is located in the endosteal and/or the periosteal regions while another, disorganized region, is located in the more central region of the cortex. Unexpectedly, we found that the disorganized region contains many islands of highly mineralized cartilage. Micro tomography showed different structural and compositional properties of the two primary structural elements; the CLB region has lower mineral density, lower porosity, larger but fewer blood vessels and fewer lacunae. However, no difference was found in the average lacunar volume. Additionally the mean indentation modulus of the CLB region was lower than that of the disorganized region. The islands of calcified cartilage were found to be extremely stiff, with an indentation modulus of 33.4 ± 3.5GPa. We conclude that though the cortical bone of rats is in part lamellar, its architecture is markedly different from that of the cortical bone of humans, a fact that must be borne in mind when using the rat as a model animal for studies of human bone biology and disease.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Molluscs deposit minerals in a chitin matrix. The mollusc chitin is synthesized by transmembrane enzymes that contain several unique extracellular domains. Here we investigate the assembly mechanism of the chitin synthase Ar-CS1 via its extracellular domain ArCS1_E22. The corresponding transmembrane protein ArCS1_E22TM accumulates in membrane fractions of the expression host Dictyostelium discoideum. Soluble recombinant ArCS1_E22 proteins can be purified as monomers only at basic pH. According to confocal fluorescence microscopy experiments, immunolabeled ArCS1_E22 proteins adsorb preferably to aragonitic nacre platelets at pH 7.75. At pH 8.2 or pH 9.0 the fluorescence signal is less intense, indicating that protein-mineral interaction is reduced with increasing pH. Furthermore, ArCS1_E22 forms regular nanostructures on cationic substrates as revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments on modified mica cleavage planes. These experiments suggest that the extracellular domain ArCS1_E22 is involved in regulating the multiple enzyme activities of Ar-CS1 such as chitin synthesis and myosin movements by interaction with mineral surfaces and eventually by protein assembly. The protein complexes could locally probe the status of mineralization according to pH unless ions and pCO2 are balanced with suitable buffer substances. Taking into account that the intact enzyme could act as a force sensor, the results presented here provide further evidence that shell formation is coordinated physiologically with precise adjustment of cellular activities to the structure, topography and stiffness at the mineralizing interface.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although trabecular bone contributes to the mechanical properties of bones, we know much less about how trabecular bone scales with BM than about how cortical bone scales with BM. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of the existing literature to test in rodents, humans and other mammals, predicted scaling properties between BM and several trabecular parameters: bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), connectivity density (ConnD) and degree of anisotropy (DA). Our results show that BV/TV and DA are independent of BM and that Tb.N, Tb.Th and Tb.Sp scale with negative allometry relative to BM. Rodents appear to have relatively thicker and fewer trabeculae than humans, and we propose it that is due to a minimum thickness threshold ""imposed"" on mechanically functional trabeculae. Consequently, rodents (mice and rats) and humans demonstrate two distinct mechanisms to achieve variations in BV/TV. Although Tb.Th variation is the main contributing factor for differences in BV/TV in humans, Tb.N variation is the main contributing factor for differences in BV/TV in rodents. Our results also demonstrate no correlation between Tb.N and Tb.Th within each taxon (mice, rats and humans). Since rodents are a common animal model for research on bone biomechanics, the evidence that trabecular bone parameters scale and correlate differently in rodents than in humans suggests that care should be applied when extrapolating bone biomechanical results from small animals to large-bodied humans.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Understanding the mechanical behavior of dentin and its relations to the dentinal structure can provides insight into the design strategies to achieve tooth functions. This study focuses on the inelastic deformation of human dentin and its underlying mechanisms. By combining four-point bending tests with fluorescent staining and laser scanning confocal microscopy, it was found that human dentin, especially root dentin, exhibited significant inelastic deformation and developed extensive microdamage in the form of microcracks prior to fracture. Dense and wavy microcracks spread uniformly across the tensile surface of root dentin, while compressive microcracks formed cross-hatched patterns. The presence of peritubular dentin in coronal dentin dramatically decreased the extent of microcracking, reducing inelasticity. Dentinal tubules were found to be initiation sites of both tensile and compressive microcracks. A unique crack propagation process was observed in root dentin under tension: numerous ring-shaped cracks formed at each dentinal tubule ahead of a growing crack tip. The advance of the tensile microcracks occurred by the merging of those ring-shaped cracks. The current findings on the microcracking process associated with inelastic deformation helps to understand the nature of strength and toughness in dentin, as well as the mechanical significance for structural variations across the whole tooth.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Application of antisense oligonucleotides that specifically suppress translation of a given mRNA are capable of causing aberrant biomineralization, thereby revealing, at least in part, a likely function of the protein and gene under investigation. We have applied this approach to study the possible function(s) of the SM30 family of proteins, which are found in spicules, teeth, spines, and tests of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus as well as other euechinoid sea urchins.

To obtaining structural information for the design of molecules able to control the signalization pathways, the proteins involved will have to be crystallized in complex with ligands that induce dimerization. Bi-functional drugs have been generated by linking two ligands together chemically and the relative crystallizability of complexes with mono-functional and bi-functional ligands has been evaluated. There are problems associated with crystallization with such ligands, but overall, the advantages appear to be greater than the drawbacks. The study involves two matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-12 and MMP-9. Using flexible and rigid linkers we show that it is possible to control the crystal packing and that by changing the ligand-enzyme stoichiometric ratio, one can toggle between having one bi-functional ligand binding to two enzymes and having the same ligand bound to each enzyme. The nature of linker and its point of attachment on the ligand can be varied to aid crystallization, and such variations can also provide valuable structural information about the interactions made by the linker with the protein.

We quantitatively analyzed the co-localization between enamelin and amelogenin by confocal microscopy and using two antibodies, one raised against a sequence in the porcine 32 kDa enamelin region and the other raised against full-length recombinant mouse amelogenin. We further investigated the interaction of the porcine 32 kDa enamelin and recombinant amelogenin using immuno-gold labeling. This study reports the quantitative co-localization results for postnatal days 1-8 mandibular mouse molars. We show that amelogenin and enamelin are secreted into the extracellular matrix on the cuspal slopes of the molars at day 1 and that secretion continues to at least day 8. Quantitative co-localization analysis (QCA) was performed in several different configurations using large (45 μm height, 33 μm width) and small (7 μm diameter) regions of interest to elucidate any patterns. Co-localization patterns in day 8 samples revealed that enamelin and amelogenin co-localize near the secretory face of the ameloblasts and appear to be secreted approximately in a 1:1 ratio. The degree of co-localization decreases as the enamel matures, both along the secretory face of ameloblasts and throughout the entire thickness of the enamel. Immuno-reactivity against enamelin is concentrated along the secretory face of ameloblasts, supporting the theory that this protein together with amelogenin is intimately involved in mineral induction at the beginning of enamel formation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We produced deformed grids by applying a deliberate mechanical deformation to EM grids containing a thin carbon film supported by a thick holey carbon film. We applied cryo-EM using deformed grids to the isolated cardiac ryanodine receptor, an ion channel complex known to assume a preferred orientation on the carbon support film. These grids contained more particles having high Euler angle orientations without the need to tilt the specimen grids. Meanwhile, the drifting that was apparent in the images was reduced from that typical of images from tilted regular EM grids. This was achieved by imaging particles in holes close to the deformed areas, where carbon films were locally bent, offering planes of inclination with various angles.

This abolishes the previous speculation that the P32T change disrupts dimerization as a mechanism of inactivation. The only difference in structure from the wild-type protein is that the area surrounding Thr32 is disrupted. Phe31 is flipped from the hydrophobic core out into the solvent, leaving a hole in the hydrophobic core of the protein which likely accounts for the reduced thermal stability of P32T ITPA and ultimately leads to its susceptibility to degradation in human cells. Circular dichroism and thermal denaturation studies confirm these structural results. We propose that the dimer of P32T variant subunit with wild-type subunit is degraded in cells similarly to the P32T homodimer explaining the level of loss of ITPA activity in heterozygotes.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Heterotrimeric G-proteins, composed of α, β and γ subunits, are important molecular switches in the mediation of GPCR signaling. Receptor stimulation after the binding of a suitable ligand leads to G-protein heterotrimer activation and dissociation into the Gα subunit and Gβγ heterodimer. These subunits then interact with a large number of effectors, leading to several cell responses. We studied the interactions between Gα subunits and their binding partners, using information from structural, mutagenesis and Bioinformatics studies, and conducted a series of comparisons of sequence, structure, electrostatic properties and intermolecular energies among different Gα families and subfamilies. We identified a number of Gα surfaces that may, in several occasions, participate in interactions with receptors as well as effectors. The study of Gα interacting surfaces in terms of sequence, structure and electrostatic potential reveals features that may account for the Gα subunit's behavior towards its interacting partners. The electrostatic properties of the Gα subunits, which in some cases differ greatly not only between families but also between subfamilies, as well as the G-protein interacting surfaces of effectors and regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) suggest that electrostatic complementarity may be an important factor in G-protein interactions. Energy calculations also support this notion. This information may be useful in future studies of G-protein interactions with GPCRs and effectors.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Major challenges of subtomogram alignment are noise enhancement due to overfitting, the bias of an initial reference in the iterative alignment process, and the computational cost of processing increasingly large amounts of data. Here, we propose an efficient and accurate alignment algorithm via a generalized convolution theorem, which allows computation of a constrained correlation function using spherical harmonics. This formulation increases computational speed of rotational matching dramatically compared to rotation search in Cartesian space without sacrificing accuracy in contrast to other spherical harmonic based approaches. Using this sampling method, a reference-free alignment procedure is proposed to tackle reference bias and overfitting, which also includes contrast transfer function correction by Wiener filtering. Application of the method to simulated data allowed us to obtain resolutions near the ground truth. For two experimental datasets, ribosomes from yeast lysate and purified 20S proteasomes, we achieved reconstructions of approximately 20Å and 16Å, respectively.

Determining the structure of a membrane protein at near-atomic resolution by electron crystallography remains, however, a very labor-intense and time-consuming task. To simplify and accelerate the data processing aspect of electron crystallography, we implemented a pipeline for the processing of electron diffraction data using the Image Processing Library and Toolbox (IPLT), which provides a modular, flexible, integrated, and extendable cross-platform, open-source framework for image processing. The diffraction data processing pipeline is organized as several independent modules implemented in Python.

The low-level image processing algorithms are implemented in C++ to achieve optimal processing performance, and their interface is exported to Python using a wrapper. For enhanced performance, the Python processing modules are complemented with a central data managing facility that provides a caching infrastructure.

In this study, the crystal structure of LC11-RNase H1 in complex with an RNA/DNA substrate was determined. Unlike Bacillus halodurans RNase H1 without hybrid binding domain (HBD) (Bh-RNase HC) and human RNase H1 without HBD (Hs-RNase HC), LC11-RNase H1 interacts with four non-consecutive 2'-OH groups of the RNA strand. The lack of interactions with four consecutive 2'-OH groups leads to a dramatic decrease in the ability of LC11-RNase H1 to cleave the DNA-RNA-DNA/DNA substrate containing four ribonucleotides as compared to those to cleave the substrates containing five and six ribonucleotides. The interaction of LC11-RNase H1 with the DNA strand is also different from those of Bh-RNase HC and Hs-RNase HC. Beside the common phosphate-binding pocket, LC11-RNase H1 has a unique DNA-binding channel. Furthermore, the active-site residues of LC11-RNase H1 are located farther away from the scissile phosphate group than those of Bh-RNase HC and Hs-RNase HC. Modeling of Sto-RNase H1 in complex with the 14bp RNA/DNA substrate, together with the structure-based mutational analyses, suggest that the ability of Sto-RNase H1 to cleave double-stranded RNA is dependent on the local conformation of the basic residues located at the DNA binding site.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In the recent β2AR-Gs structure, portions of Switch I and II of Gα are not fully elucidated. We paired fluorescence studies of receptor-Gαi interactions with the β2AR-Gs and other Gi structures to investigate changes in Switch I and II during receptor activation and GTP binding. The β2/β3 loop containing Leu194 of Gαi is located between Switches I and II, in close proximity to IC2 of the receptor and the C-terminus of Gα, thus providing an allosteric connection between these Switches and receptor activation. We compared the environment of residues in myristoylated Gαi proteins in the heterotrimer to that upon receptor activation and subsequent GTP binding. Upon receptor activation, residues in both Switch regions are less solvent-exposed, as compared to the heterotrimer. Upon GTPγS binding, the environment of several residues in Switch I resemble the receptor-bound state, while Switch II residues display effects on their environment which are consistent with their role in GTP binding and Gβγ dissociation.

However, the physiological significance of forming the lattice has long been elusive. Here, we study this issue by comparing properties of assembled and non-assembled bR trimers using directed mutagenesis, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), optical spectroscopy, and a proton pumping assay. First, we show that the bonds formed between W12 and F135 amino acid residues are responsible for trimer-trimer association that leads to lattice assembly; the lattice is completely disrupted in both W12I and F135I mutants. HS-AFM imaging reveals that both crystallized D96N and non-crystallized D96N/W12I mutants undergo a large conformational change (i.e., outward E-F loop displacement) upon light-activation. However, lattice disruption significantly reduces the rate of conformational change under continuous light illumination. Nevertheless, the quantum yield of M-state formation, measured by low-temperature UV-visible spectroscopy, and proton pumping efficiency are unaffected by lattice disruption. From these results, we conclude that trimer-trimer association plays essential roles in providing bound retinal with an appropriate environment to maintain its full photo-reactivity and in maintaining the natural photo-reaction pathway.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Like other pathogenic bacteria, Neisseria must acquire iron for survival from their local environment within the human host. Instead of secreting siderophores to scavenge iron, Neisseria steal iron from human iron binding proteins such as hemoglobin, transferrin and lactoferrin for survival. Recently we reported the crystal structures of the Neisseria meningitidis transferrin receptors TbpA and TbpB, as well as the structures of apo and holo human transferrin.

It is over-expressed in the new blood vessels grown by tumor cells and is a target for anti-tumor treatments. Peptides that expose the consensus sequence R/K/XXR/K at the C-terminus (C-end rule or CendR peptides) bind to NRP-1 and are internalized into the cell. We used peptide phage display binding assays and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the potential role of the central residues of CendR peptides in binding and activation of the NRP-1 receptor. The high stability of RPAR-receptor domain complex stems from the formation of a characteristic pattern of three hydrogen bonds between the peptide C-terminus and the residues in the NRP-1 loop III. Any changes in the peptide structure that fail to preserve this triad result in a less-stable complex. We performed a systematic study of RXXR mutants, where X=A/D/S/R/P, in order to test the effect of replacement of A or P on the binding capabilities. Our results, both experimental and computational, show that RRAR, RDAR, RPDR, RPRR and RPPR are capable of binding NRP-1. However, only RPPR and RPRR segments form an optimal organization around loop III with low potential energy. In other analogs, the absence of these stabilizing interactions always results in higher potential energy of the complexes. The binding of RPAR analogs does not guarantee receptor activation; only stable complexes that are properly stabilized via loop III appear able to trigger NRP-1 activation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

One prominent example is the type II secretion system (T2SS), which contains a large outer membrane channel, called the secretin. These gated channels require specialized proteins, so-called pilotins, to reach and assemble in the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the pilotin GspS from the T2SS of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), an important pathogen that can cause severe disease in cases of food poisoning. In this four-helix protein, the straight helix α2, the curved helix α3 and the bent helix α4 surround the central N-terminal helix α1. The helices of GspS create a prominent groove, mainly formed by side chains of helices α1, α2 and α3. In the EHEC GspS structure this groove is occupied by extra electron density which is reminiscent of an α-helix and corresponds well with a binding site observed in a homologous pilotin. The residues forming the groove are well conserved among homologs, pointing to a key role of this groove in this class of T2SS pilotins. At the same time, T2SS pilotins in different species can be entirely different in structure, and the pilotins for secretins in non-T2SS machineries have yet again unrelated folds, despite a common function. It is striking that a common complex function, such as targeting and assembling an outer membrane multimeric channel, can be performed by proteins with entirely different folds.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We introduce MAPPOS, a supervised post-picking strategy for the classification of boxed particle images, as additional strategy adding to the already efficient automated particle picking routines. MAPPOS employs machine learning techniques to train a robust classifier from a small number of characteristic image features. In order to accurately quantify the performance of MAPPOS we used simulated particle and non-particle images. In addition, we verified our method by applying it to an experimental cryo-EM dataset and comparing the results to the manual classification of the same dataset. Comparisons between MAPPOS and manual post-picking classification by several human experts demonstrated that merely a few hundred sample images are sufficient for MAPPOS to classify an entire dataset with a human-like performance.

As the number of structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank by fitting a high-resolution structure into a low-resolution cryo-EM map is increasing, there is a need to revise the protocols and improve the measures for fitting. A recent study suggested using a combination of multiple automated flexible fitting approaches to improve the interpretation of cryo-EM data. The current work further explores the use of multiple approaches by validating this ""consensus"" fitting approach and deriving a local reliability measure. Here four different flexible fitting approaches are applied for fitting an initial structure into a simulated density map of known target structure from a dataset of proteins. It is found that the models produced from different approaches often have a consensus in conformation and are also near to the target structure, whereas cases not showing consensus are away from the target. A high correlation is also observed between the RMSF profiles calculated with respect to the average and the target structures, which indicates that the relation between consensus and accuracy can also be extended to a per-residue level. Therefore, the RMSF among the fitted models is proposed as a local reliability measure, which can be used to assess the reliability of the fit at specific regions. Hence, we encourage the community to use consensus flexible fitting with different methods to report on local reliability of the resulting models and improve the interpretation of cryo-EM data.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

For example, subtomograms of individual particles can be acquired from tomography, or volumes of multiple 2D classes can be obtained by random conical tilt reconstruction. Of these, similar volumes can be averaged to achieve higher resolution. Volume alignment is an essential step before 3D classification and averaging. Here we present a projection-based volume alignment (PBVA) algorithm. We select a set of projections to represent the reference volume and align them to a second volume. Projection alignment is achieved by maximizing the cross-correlation function with respect to rotation and translation parameters. If data are missing, the cross-correlation functions are normalized accordingly. Accurate alignments are obtained by averaging and quadratic interpolation of the cross-correlation maximum. Comparisons of the computation time between PBVA and traditional 3D cross-correlation methods demonstrate that PBVA outperforms the traditional methods.

Its organic matrix has a hierarchically organised structure, and type and phase of the mineral compound can vary. The cuticle forms functionally diverse skeletal elements whose properties are adapted to their specific functions. In order to better understand the relation between structure, composition and function of isopod cuticle, we studied the structure and composition of the joint head that is part of the pereiopod's basis. It consists of a central region, whose shape fits well into the joint socket, and an edge region that is connected to the soft arthrodial membrane and protects the central region from mechanical load. The cuticle architecture of the joint head has local variations in structure and composition. In the central region the cuticle is similar to the previously published tergite cuticle. High concentrations of amorphous calcium phosphate are located in the endocuticle suggesting a coexistence with amorphous calcium carbonate. The edge region has an unexpected organisation characterised by thickening of the epi- and exocuticle and an unusual unidirectional orientation of chitin-protein fibrils within the endocuticle. The concentrations of phosphate are considerably higher than in the central region. The overall differentiation in the cuticular architecture of the edge in comparison to the central region reflects the adaptation to mechanical strains the cuticle has to sustain during contraction of extensor muscles, and to the structural and compositional transition from the edge to the connecting arthrodial membrane.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Simulations were carried out to generate 3D oversampled diffraction patterns of non-crystalline biological samples, ranging from peptides and proteins to megadalton complex assemblies, and to recover their molecular structure from nanometer to near-atomic resolutions. Using these simulated data, we show here that iterative reconstruction methods based on standard and variant forms of the charge flipping algorithm, can efficiently solve the phase retrieval problem and extract a unique and reliable molecular structure. Contrary to the case of conventional algorithms, where the estimation and the use of a compact support is imposed, our approach does not require any prior information about the molecular assembly, and is amenable to a wide range of biological assemblies.

However, its basic building blocks, the aragonite tablets, are still under debate in terms of their fine structure at the nanoscale and corresponding formation mechanism. Here, using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), and X-ray diffractometer, we comparatively investigate the immature and mature tablet from the green mussel's nacre. We find that: (1) the early immature tablet consists of closely-packed colloidal nanoparticles, which contain nanocrystals surrounded by the amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase. Moreover, these nanocrystals are generally different in shape, size, and orientation; (2) the immature tablet can grow via oriented attachment besides via transformation of the ACC phase; and (3) with growth, the colloidal nanoparticles gradually increase in crystallinity and size until fully crystallized and fused together, leading to a mature tablet that is a monolithic single crystal of aragonite. Based on these findings, we propose a new model showing how the mature tablet evolves from the primary colloidal ACC nanoparticles. We expect this work will provide new insights into the formation of single crystal biominerals via the amorphous precursor route.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

They are responsible for a severe degeneration of grapevines that occurs in most vineyards worldwide. Although sharing a high level of sequence identity between their CP, ArMV is transmitted exclusively by the ectoparasitic nematode Xiphinema diversicaudatum whereas GFLV is specifically transmitted by the nematode X. index. The structural determinants involved in the transmission specificity of both viruses map solely to their respective CP. Recently, reverse genetic and crystallographic studies on GFLV revealed that a positively charged pocket in the CP B domain located at the virus surface may be responsible for vector specificity. To go further into delineating the coat protein determinants involved in transmission specificity, we determined the 6.5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of ArMV and used homology modeling and flexible fitting approaches to build its pseudo-atomic structure. This study allowed us to resolve ArMV CP architecture and delineate connections between ArMV capsid shell and its RNA.

In all other known chlorocatechol pathways the dehalogenation is a spontaneous secondary reaction of the unstable chloromuconate intermediate following the lactonization process catalyzed by the muconate cycloisomerases. The crystallographic structure of the decameric 5-CMLD was solved by Molecular Replacement, using the coordinates of the low resolution structure of the highly homologous muconolactone isomerase, an enzyme of the conventional ortho-pathway. Muconolactone isomerase catalyzes the endocyclic rearrangement of the double bond within the lactone ring of muconolactone to yield 3-oxoadipate enol lactone. Although both 5-CMLD and muconolactone isomerase share the ability to dechlorinate 5-chloromuconolactone, 5-CMLD shows a significant degree of specialization, having lost the capacity to convert its original substrate muconolactone. The active site of 5-CMLD was previously hypothesized to reside in a deep pocket at the interface of two different subunits, on the basis of a muconolactone isomerase structure analysis.

Atomic density is calculated by one-dimensional Fourier transform of atomic form factors convoluted with a microscope envelope correction and a low-pass filter, allowing refinement of imaging parameters such as resolution, by optimizing the agreement of calculated and experimental maps. A similar approach allows refinement of atomic displacement parameters, providing indications of molecular flexibility even at low resolution. A modest improvement in atomic coordinates is possible following optimization of these additional parameters. Methods have been implemented in a Python program that can be used in stand-alone mode for rigid-group refinement, or embedded in other optimizers for flexible refinement with stereochemical restraints. The approach is demonstrated with refinements of virus and chaperonin structures at resolutions of 9 through 4.5 Å, representing regimes where rigid-group and fully flexible parameterizations are appropriate. Through comparisons to known crystal structures, flexible fitting by RSRef is shown to be an improvement relative to other methods and to generate models with all-atom rms accuracies of 1.5-2.5 Å at resolutions of 4.5-6 Å.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The efficient application of the single particle cryoEM approach requires the sample to be vitrified within the holes of carbon films, with particles well dispersed throughout the ice and adopting multiple orientations. To achieve this, the carbon support film is first hydrophilised by glow discharge, which allows the sample to spread over the film. Unfortunately, for transmembrane complexes especially, this procedure can result in severe sample adsorption to the carbon support film, reducing the number of particles dispersed in the ice. This problem is rate-limiting in the single particle cryoEM approach and has hindered its widespread application to hydrophobic complexes. We describe a novel grid preparation technique that allows for good particle dispersion in the ice and minimal hydrophobic particle adhesion to the support film. This is achieved by hydrophilisation of the carbon support film by the use of selected detergents that interact with the support so as to achieve a hydrophilic and neutral or selectively charged surface.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The problem is particularly important when an experimentalist wants to improve the resolution of a 3D map by increasing by tens or hundreds of thousands of images the size of the dataset used for calculating the map. Although several existing methods for automatic particle image selection work well for large protein complexes that produce high-contrast images, it is well known in the cryo-EM community that small complexes that give low-contrast images are often refractory to existing automated particle image selection schemes. Here we develop a method for partially-automated particle image selection when an initial 3D map of the protein under investigation is already available. Candidate particle images are selected from micrographs by template matching with template images derived from projections of the existing 3D map. The candidate particle images are then used to train a support vector machine, which classifies the candidates as particle images or non-particle images. In a final step in the analysis, the selected particle images are subjected to projection matching against the initial 3D map, with the correlation coefficient between the particle image and the best matching map projection used to assess the reliability of the particle image. We show that this approach is able to rapidly select particle images from micrographs of a rotary ATPase, a type of membrane protein complex involved in many aspects of biology.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we describe a simple cross-linking procedure that can be used to stabilize fragile components of the ECC machinery, for the purpose of structural elucidation by single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). As a model system, the complex of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and RyR1 was used to test the cross-linking protocol.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic TDO from Drosophila melanogaster (DmTDO) in complex with heme at 2.7Å resolution. DmTDO consists of an N-terminal segment, a large domain and a small domain, and assumes a tetrameric architecture. Compared with prokaryotic TDOs, DmTDO contains two major insertion sequences: one forms part of the heme-binding site and the other forms a large portion of the small domain. The small domain which is unique to eukaryotic TDOs, interacts with the active site of an adjacent monomer and plays a role in the catalysis. Molecular modeling and dynamics simulation of DmTDO-heme-Trp suggest that like prokaryotic TDOs, DmTDO adopts an induced-fit mechanism to bind l-Trp; in particular, two conserved but flexible loops undergo conformational changes, converting the active site from an open conformation to a closed conformation. The functional roles of the key residues involved in recognition and binding of the heme and the substrate are verified by mutagenesis and kinetic studies. In addition, a modeling study of DmTDO in complex with the competitive inhibitor LM10 provides useful information for further inhibitor design.

Previous studies suggested that SHP-1 contains a PTP1B-like second phosphotyrosine pocket that allows for binding of tandem phosphotyrosine residues, such as those found in the activation loop of JAK kinases. To discover the structural nature of the interaction between SHP-1 and the JAK family member, JAK1, we determined the 1.8Å co-crystal structure of the SHP-1 catalytic domain and a JAK1-derived substrate peptide. This structure reveals electron density for only one bound phosphotyrosine residue. To investigate the role of the predicted second site pocket we determined the structures of SHP-1 in complex with phosphate and sulfate to 1.37Å and 1.7Å, respectively, and performed anomalous scattering experiments for a selenate-soaked crystal. These crystallographic data suggest that SHP-1 does not contain a PTP1B-like second site pocket. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of the relative dephosphorylation and binding affinities of mono- and tandem-phosphorylated peptide substrates. The crystal structures instead indicate that SHP-1 contains an extended C-terminal helix α2' incompatible with the predicted second phosphotyrosine binding site. This study suggests that SHP-1 defines a new category of PTP1B-like protein tyrosine phosphatases with a hindered second phosphotyrosine pocket.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

AFM imaging enabled direct comparison of full length monomers at different ages. The higher proportion of aggrecan fragments observed in adult versus newborn populations is consistent with the cumulative proteolysis of aggrecan known to occur in vivo. The decreased dimensions of adult full length aggrecan (including core protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain trace length, end-to-end distance and extension ratio) reflect altered aggrecan biosynthesis. The demonstrably shorter GAG chains observed in adult full length aggrecan monomers, compared to newborn monomers, also reflects markedly altered biosynthesis with age. Direct visualization of aggrecan subjected to chondroitinase and/or keratanase treatment revealed conformational properties of aggrecan monomers associated with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS) GAG chains. Furthermore, compressive stiffness of chemically end-attached layers of adult and newborn aggrecan was measured in various ionic strength aqueous solutions. Adult aggrecan was significantly weaker in compression than newborn aggrecan even at the same total GAG density and bath ionic strength, suggesting the importance of both electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions in nanomechanical stiffness.

Alveolar plates are arranged by overlapping like an armor and they are thought to protect and/or stiffen the cell. Although their morphology is species-specific and of complex architecture, so far almost nothing is known about their genesis, their structure and their elemental and mineral composition. We investigated the genesis of new alveolar plates after cell division and examined cells and isolated alveolar plates by electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, FTIR and X-ray diffraction. Our investigations revealed an organic mesh-like structure that guides the formation of new alveolar plates like a template and the role of vesicles transporting inorganic material.

Analysis of their three-dimensional Fourier transform indicates that this imaging artifact is due to a decrease in the angular sampling of their equatorial components.

Of the over 70 proteins that form the spore coat, only a small subset of them affect its morphogenesis, they are referred to as morphogenetic proteins. In this study we investigated the interaction between two spore coat morphogenetic proteins SpoVID and CotE. SpoVID is involved in the process of spore surface encirclement by individual coat proteins, these include CotE, which controls the assembly of the outer coat layer. Both proteins were proposed to be recruited to a common protein scaffold, but their direct association has not been previously shown. Here we studied the interactions between CotE and SpoVID in vitro for the first time by using molecule recognition force spectroscopy, which allows the detection of piconewton forces between conjugated biological pairs and also facilitates the investigation of dynamic processes. The most probable CotE-CotE unbinding force was 49.4±0.1pN at a loading rate of 3.16×10³ pN/s while that of SpoVID-CotE was 26.5±0.6pN at a loading rate of 7.8×10² pN/s. We further analyzed the interactions with the bacterial two hybrid system and pull-down experiments, which also indicate that SpoVID interacts directly with CotE. In combination with the previously identified direct contacts among SpoIVA, SpoVID and SafA, our data imply that the physical association of key morphogenetic proteins forms a basic skeleton where other coat proteins could be attached.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While prokaryotic ACKs have been the subject of extensive biochemical and structural characterization, there is a comparative paucity of information on eukaryotic ACKs, and prior to this report, no structure of an ACK of eukaryotic origin was available. We determined the structures of ACKs from the eukaryotic pathogens Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptococcus neoformans. Each active site is located at an interdomain interface, and the acetate and phosphate binding pockets display sequence and structural conservation with their prokaryotic counterparts. Interestingly, the E. histolytica ACK has previously been shown to be pyrophosphate (PP(i))-dependent, and is the first ACK demonstrated to have this property. Examination of its structure demonstrates how subtle amino acid substitutions within the active site have converted cosubstrate specificity from ATP to PP(i) while retaining a similar backbone conformation. Differences in the angle between domains surrounding the active site suggest that interdomain movement may accompany catalysis.

In most cases, intrinsic disorder manifests itself in segments or domains of an IDP, called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), but fully disordered IDPs also exist. Although IDRs can be detected as missing residues in protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography, no protocol has been developed to identify IDRs from structures obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Here, we propose a computational method to assign IDRs based on NMR structures. We compared missing residues of X-ray structures with residue-wise deviations of NMR structures for identical proteins, and derived a threshold deviation that gives the best correlation of ordered and disordered regions of both structures. The obtained threshold of 3.2Å was applied to proteins whose structures were only determined by NMR, and the resulting IDRs were analyzed and compared to those of X-ray structures with no NMR counterpart in terms of sequence length, IDR fraction, protein function, cellular location, and amino acid composition, all of which suggest distinct characteristics.

Random Conical Tilt and Orthogonal Tilt Reconstruction techniques in combination with 3D alignment and classification can be used to obtain initial low-resolution reconstructions which represent the full range of structural heterogeneity of the dataset. In order to achieve statistical significance, however, a large number of 3D reconstructions, and, in turn, a large number of tilted image pairs are required. The extraction of single particle tilted image pairs from micrographs can be tedious and time-consuming, as it requires intensive user input even for semi-automated approaches. To overcome the bottleneck of manual selection of a large number of tilt pairs, we developed an algorithm for the correlation of single particle images from tilted image pairs in a fully automated and user-independent manner. The algorithm reliably correlates correct pairs even from noisy micrographs.

Recent discoveries demonstrate the important role of carboxyl-terminal fragments of TDP-43 in its proteinopathy. Herein, we report the characterization of β-domains in the C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Careful comparison of the wild-type TDP-43 (Wt) and the three mutant TDP-43 peptides: an ALS-related mutant peptide: phosphorylated A315T mutant TDP-43 (A315T(p)) and two model peptides: A315T mutant TDP-43 (A315T), A315E mutant TDP-43 (A315E) reveals that A315T(p) has a longer core region of the β-domain than Wt.

Toughness can also be enhanced by modifications in osteon cross-sectional size (diameter) for specific load environments; for example, smaller osteons in more highly strained ""compression"" regions vs. larger osteons in less strained ""tension"" regions. Additional osteon characteristics that enhance toughness are distinctive variations in collagen/lamellar organization (i.e., ""osteon morphotypes""). Interactions might exist between osteon diameter and morphotype that represent adaptations for resisting deleterious shear stresses that occur at the cement line. This may be why osteons often have a peripheral ring (or ""hoop"") of highly oblique/transverse collagen. We hypothesized that well developed/distinct ""hoops"" are compensatory adaptations in cases where increased osteon diameter is mechanically advantageous (e.g., larger osteons in ""tension"" regions would have well developed/distinct ""hoops"" in order to resist deleterious consequences of co-existing localized shear stresses). We tested this hypothesis by determining if there are correlations between osteon diameters and strongly hooped morphotypes in ""tension"", ""compression"", and ""neutral axis"" regions of femora (chimpanzees, humans), radii (horse, sheep) and calcanei (horse, deer). The results reject the hypothesis-larger osteons are not associated with well developed/distinct ""hoops"", even in ""tension regions"" where the effect was expected to be obvious.

This problem arises in many applications, such as image processing, web data ranking, and bioinformatic data analysis. It was recently shown that under surprisingly broad conditions, the Robust PCA problem can be exactly solved via convex optimization that minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and the l-norm . In this paper, we apply the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to solve this convex program. As the objective function is non-smooth, we show how to extend the classical analysis of ALM to such new objective functions and prove the optimality of the proposed algorithms and characterize their convergence rate. Empirically, the proposed new algorithms can be more than five times faster than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms for Robust PCA, such as the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm. Moreover, the new algorithms achieve higher precision, yet being less storage/memory demanding. We also show that the ALM technique can be used to solve the (related but somewhat simpler) matrix completion problem and obtain rather promising results too. We further prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the inexact ALM to converge globally.

A collagenous network that connects the tooth root surface to the alveolar jaw bone is one of the major components of the PDL. The organization of the collagenous component and how it changes under load is still poorly understood.

We demonstrate that the PDL collagen network is organized in sheets. The spaces between sheets vary thus creating dense and sparse networks. Upon vertical loading, the sheets in both networks are stretched into well aligned arrays. The sparse network is located mainly in areas which undergo compressive loading as the tooth moves towards the bone, whereas the dense network functions mostly in tension as the tooth moves further from the bone.

The current literature has established the science of PfAQP's structure, functions, and hydrogen-bonding interactions but left unanswered the following fundamental question: does glycerol modulate water permeation through aquaglyceroporin that conducts both glycerol and water? This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question of essential importance to the protein's functions. On the basis of the chemical-potential profile of glycerol from the extracellular bulk region, throughout PfAQP's conducting channel, to the cytoplasmic bulk region, this study shows the existence of a bound state of glycerol inside aquaglyceroporin's permeation pore, from which the dissociation constant is approximately 14μM. A glycerol molecule occupying the bound state occludes the conducting pore through which permeating molecules line up in single file by hydrogen-bonding with one another and with the luminal residues of aquaglyceroporin. In this way, glycerol inhibits permeation of water and other permeants through aquaglyceroporin. The biological implications of this theory are discussed and shown to agree with the existent in vitro data. It turns out that the structure of aquaglyceroporin is perfect for the van der Waals interactions between the protein and glycerol to cause the existence of the bound state deep inside the conducting pore and, thus to play an unexpected but significant role in aquaglyceroporin's functions.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Interpretation of the resulting 3D volumes strongly depends on segmentation, which consists in decomposing the volume into their structural components. The computational approaches proposed so far have not turned out to be of general applicability. Thus, manual segmentation still remains a prevalent method. Here, a new computational framework for segmentation of 3D EM datasets is introduced. It relies on detection and characterization of ridges (i.e. local maxima). The detected ridges are modelled as asymmetric Gaussian functions whose parameters constitute ridge descriptors. This local information is then used to cluster the ridges, which leads to the ultimate segmentation. In this work we focus on membranes and locally planar structures in general.

HBV capsids are icosahedral shells with 25Å-long dimeric spikes, each a 4-helix bundle, protruding from the contiguous ""floor"". Of the anti-HBcAg antibodies previously characterized, most bind around the spike tip while one binds to the floor. The ALF-associated antibody binds tangentially to a novel site on the side of the spike. This epitope is conformational. The Fab binds with high affinity to its principal determinants but has lower affinities for quasi-equivalent variants. The highest occupancy site is on one side of a spike, with no detectable binding to the corresponding site on the other side. Binding of one Fab per dimer was also observed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The Fab did not bind to the e-antigen dimer, a non-assembling variant of capsid protein.

Its membrane association, allosteric activation and membrane dissociation are poorly understood. We recently reported PTEN binding affinities to membranes of different compositions (Shenoy et al., 2012, PLoS ONE 7, e32591) and a preliminary investigation of the protein-membrane complex with neutron reflectometry (NR). Here we use NR to validate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the protein and study conformational differences of the protein in solution and on anionic membranes. NR shows that full-length PTEN binds to such membranes roughly in the conformation and orientation suggested by the crystal structure of a truncated PTEN protein, in contrast with a recently presented model which suggested that membrane binding depends critically on the SUMOylation of the CBR3 loop of PTEN's C2 domain. Our MD simulations confirm that PTEN is peripherally bound to the bilayer surface and show slight differences of the protein structure in solution and in the membrane-bound state, where the protein body flattens against the bilayer surface. PTEN's C2 domain binds phosphatidylserine (PS) tightly through its CBR3 loop, and its phosphatase domain also forms electrostatic interactions with PS. NR and MD results show consistently that PTEN's unstructured, anionic C-terminal tail is repelled from the bilayer surface. In contrast, this tail is tightly tugged against the C2 domain in solution, partially obstructing the membrane-binding interface of the protein. Arresting the C-terminal tail in this conformation by phosphorylation may provide a control mechanism for PTEN's membrane binding and activity.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Differential binding of MgATP and -ADP to subunit B has been described, which does not exist in the related α and B subunits of F-ATP synthases and V-ATPases, respectively. The conserved phosphate loop residues, histidine and asparagine, of the A-ATP synthase subunit B have been proposed to be essential for γ-phosphate interaction. To investigate the role of these conserved P-loop residues in nucleotide-binding, subunit B residues H156 and N157 of the Methanosarcina mazei Gö1 A-ATP synthase were separately substituted with alanine. In addition, N157 was mutated to threonine, because it is the corresponding amino acid in the P-loop of F-ATP synthase subunit α. The structures of the subunit B mutants H156A, N157A/T were solved up to a resolution of 1.75 and 1.7 Å. The binding constants for MgATP and -ADP were determined, demonstrating that the H156A and N157A mutants have a preference to the nucleotide over the wild type and N157T proteins. Importantly, the ability to distinguish MgATP or -ADP was lost, demonstrating that the histidine and asparagine residues are crucial for nucleotide differentiation in subunit B. The structures reveal that the enhanced binding of the alanine mutants is attributed to the increased accessibility of the nucleotide binding cavity, explaining that the structural arrangement of the conserved H156 and N157 define the nucleotide-binding characteristics of the regulatory subunit B of A-ATP synthases.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns revealed anisotropic distortions of the orthorhombic aragonite unit cell, reaching a maximum of about 0.2% (along the c-direction) with respect to geological aragonite. Lattice distortions are effectively relieved under mild annealing at temperatures between 150 °C and 250 °C. This relaxation correlated well with the loss of organic substance during annealing, measured by thermal gravimetric analysis. The shell ultrastructure consists of three orders of hierarchy, which is typical for crossed-lamellar layers. The third-order fiber-like lamellae, nearly 50 × 250 nm² in cross-section, are heavily twinned, producing specific contrast features in transmission electron microscopy micrographs. So, higher orders of hierarchy are, in fact, twins, which boundaries are free of organic matter.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The skeletal texture consists of centers of calcification (COCs) and fiber area. Fiber areas contain bundles of needle-like aragonite crystals that are elongated along the crystallographic c-axis and are several hundred nanometers to one micrometer in width and several micrometers in length. The size distribution of aragonite crystals is relatively homogeneous in the fibers. Growth lines are observed sub-perpendicular to the direction of aragonite growth. These growth lines occur in 1-2 μm intervals and reflect a periodic contrast in the thickness of an ion-spattered sample and pass through the interior of some aragonite crystals. These observations suggest that the medium filled in the calcification space maintains a CaCO₃-supersaturated state during fiber growth and that a physical change occurs periodically during the aragonite crystals of the fiber area.,False,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite collagen's importance, little is known about its nanoscale morphology in tissues and how morphology relates to mechanical function. This study probes nanoscale structure and mechanical properties of collagen as a function of disease in native hydrated tendons. Wild type tendon and tendon from the Brtl/+ mouse model of Osteogenesis Imperfecta were investigated. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to image and indent minimally-processed collagen fibrils in hydrated and dehydrated conditions. AFM was used because of the ability to keep biological tissues as close to their native in situ conditions as possible. The study demonstrated phenotypic difference in Brtl/+ fibril morphology and mechanics in hydrated tendon which became more compelling upon dehydration. Dried tendons had a significant downward shift in fibril D-periodic spacing versus a shift up in wet tendons. Nanoscale changes in morphology in dry samples were accompanied by significant increases in modulus and adhesion force and decreased indentation depth. A minimal mechanical phenotype existed in hydrated samples, possibly due to water masking structural defects within the diseased fibrils. This study demonstrates that collagen nanoscale morphology and mechanics are impacted in Brtl/+ tendons, and that the phenotype can be modulated by the presence or absence of water. Dehydration causes artifacts in biological samples which require water and this factor must be considered for studies at any length scale in collagen-based tissues, especially when characterizing disease-induced differences.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition it can be helpful for rational structure-based drug design on target proteins of medical relevance and for evaluating the tendency of proteins to aggregate or oligomerize. A new approach termed dPredGB to detect and evaluate putative binding cavities on protein surfaces has been developed. In contrast to existing prediction methods that are based on purely geometric features of binding sites or on possible direct interactions with a putative binding partner the dPredGB approach combines rapid geometric detection with an evaluation of the desolvation properties of the putative binding pocket. It has been tested on a variety of proteins known to bind ligands in bound and unbound conformations. The approach outperforms most available methods and offers also the spatial characterization of the desolvation properties of a binding region. On a test set of proteins the method identifies in 69% of the unbound cases and 85% of the bound cases the known ligand binding cavity as the top ranking prediction. Possibilities to improve the prediction performance even further are also discussed.,False,Journal of structural biology,False

To make full use of the structural information contained in tomograms it is necessary to analyze the contrast transfer function (CTF) of projections and to restore the phases of higher spatial frequencies. CTF correction is however hampered by the difficulty of determining the actual defocus values from tilt series data, which is due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of electron micrographs. In this study, an extended acquisition scheme is introduced that enables an independent CTF determination. Two high-dose images are recorded along the tilt axis on both sides of each projection, which allow an accurate determination of the defocus values of these images. These values are used to calculate the CTF for each image of the tilt series. We applied this scheme to the mycobacterial outer membrane protein MspA reconstituted in lipid vesicles and tested several variants of CTF estimation in combination with subtomogram averaging and correction of the modulation transfer function (MTF). The 3D electron density map of MspA was compared with a structure previously determined by X-ray crystallography. We were able to demonstrate that structural information up to a resolution of 16.8Å can be recovered using our CTF correction approach, whereas the uncorrected 3D map had a resolution of only 26.2Å.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In vitro reconstitution and characterization of these interactions is challenged by the difficulty to integrate a physiological membrane environment. Here a single copy of the full-length ZipA protein from Escherichia coli incorporated into phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs (Nd-ZipA) has been visualized using negative-staining electron microscopy (EM). The EM images reveal the presence of discs, mostly organized in two distinct populations of 11 and 13nm in diameter. The globular FtsZ-binding C-terminal domain of ZipA (ZBD) was not visible in 3D reconstructions of Nd-ZipA or 2D averages, suggesting that this domain is separated from the membrane by the large flexible domain connecting the N-terminal trans-membrane region to the ZBD. We tested if Nd-ZipA were appropriate models for the in vitro reconstitution of ZipA-FtsZ interactions. First we observed that the ZBD region of ZipA was accessible for the interaction with other proteins in the context of the nanodisc, as revealed by its recognition by specific antibodies. In addition, Nd-ZipA attached to carbon coated EM grids, but not empty nanodiscs, were able to capture FtsZ filaments without inducing significant filament bundling, consistent with a model in which FtsZ filaments are loosely attached to the cell-membrane. These observations are compatible with the plastic nature of the ZipA-FtsZ complexes formed at the membrane, evidenced in the moderate binding affinity of Nd-ZipA to FtsZ oligomers and polymers recently measured.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In Escherichia coli, the uup gene encodes a 72 kDa polypeptide that comprises two ABC domains, separated by a linker region, and a 12kDa C-terminal domain (CTD). Uup binds double-stranded DNA with no sequence specificity, and we previously demonstrated that the CTD domain is a crucial region that participates in DNA-binding activity. We report herein the NMR structure of Uup CTD, consisting of an intramolecular antiparallel two-stranded coiled coil motif. Structural comparison with analogous coiled coil domains reveals that Uup CTD contains an atypical 3(10)-helix in the α-hairpin region that contributes to the hydrophobic core. Using NMR titration experiments, we identified residues of the CTD domain involved in the binding to double-stranded DNA. These residues are located on two opposite surfaces at the base of the coiled coil, formed by the N- and C-terminal extremities, where a strictly conserved proline residue induces an overwinding of the coiled coil. Finally, preliminary analysis of NMR spectra recorded on distinct Uup constructs precludes a fully flexible positioning of the CTD domain in full-length Uup.

On the other hand, aragonite in the nacre of the four species showed almost no difference of the peak widths between the paired reflections, indicating low twin densities.

These techniques, however, are unable to map collagen fibril polarity, i.e., the polar orientation that is directed from the amine to the carboxyl termini. Using a voltage modulated AFM-based technique called piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we show it is possible to visualize both the alignment of collagen fibrils within a tissue and the polar orientation of the fibrils with minimal sample preparation. We demonstrate the technique on rat tail tendon and porcine eye tissues in ambient conditions. In each sample, fibrils are arranged into domains whereby neighboring domains exhibit opposite polarizations, which in some cases extend to the individual fibrillar level. Uniform polarity has not been observed in any of the tissues studied. Evidence of anti-parallel ordering of the amine to carboxyl polarity in bundles of fibrils or in individual fibrils is found in all tissues, which has relevance for understanding mechanical and biofunctional properties and the formation of connective tissues.

This unique imaging tool allows for rapid identification of a region of interest with the FM, and subsequent high resolution TEM imaging of this area. Sample preparation is one of the major challenges in correlative microscopy of a single specimen; it needs to be apt for both FM and TEM imaging. For iLEM, the performance of the fluorescent probe should not be impaired by the vacuum of the TEM. In this technical note, we have compared the fluorescence intensity of six fluorescent probes in a dry, oxygen free environment relative to their performance in water. We demonstrate that the intensity of some fluorophores is strongly influenced by its surroundings, which should be taken into account in the design of the experiment. Furthermore, a freeze-substitution and Lowicryl resin embedding protocol is described that yields excellent membrane contrast in the TEM but prevents quenching of the fluorescent immuno-labeling. The embedding protocol results in a single specimen preparation procedure that performs well in both FM and TEM.

These proteins are vital for the formation and elongation of the autophagosome and essential to the process of macroautophagy. Autophagy may be required for conversion of the sporozoite into erythrocytic-infective merozoites and may be crucial for other functions during asexual blood stages.

This suggested that inactivation of the two heads occurs by blocking of the actin-binding site of one (free head) and the ATP hydrolysis site of the other (blocked head). This motif has been found by EM of isolated negatively stained myosin molecules of unregulated (vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscle) and regulated (invertebrate striated and vertebrate smooth muscle) myosins, and nonmuscle myosin. The same motif has also been found in 3D-reconstructions of frozen-hydrated (tarantula, Limulus, scallop) and negatively stained (scallop, vertebrate cardiac) isolated thick filaments. We are carrying out studies of isolated thick filaments from other species to assess how general this myosin interacting-heads motif is. Here, using EM, we have visualized isolated, negatively stained thick filaments from scorpion striated muscle. We modified the iterative helical real space reconstruction (IHRSR) method to include filament tilt, and band-pass filtered the aligned segments before averaging, achieving a 3.3 nm resolution 3D-reconstruction. This reconstruction revealed the presence of the myosin interacting-heads motif (adding to evidence that is widely spread), together with 12 subfilaments in the filament backbone. This demonstrates that conventional negative staining and imaging can be used to detect the presence of the myosin interacting-heads motif in helically ordered thick filaments from different species and muscle types, thus avoiding the use of less accessible cryo-EM and low electron-dose procedures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

ShPI-1, a BPTI Kunitz-type inhibitor from the Caribbean Sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, displays activity not only against serine-, but also against cysteine-, and aspartate proteases. As an initial step to evaluate the molecular basis of its activities, we describe the crystallographic structure of ShPI-1 in complex with the serine protease bovine pancreatic trypsin at 1.7Å resolution. The overall structure and the important enzyme-inhibitor interactions of this first invertebrate BPTI-like Kunitz-type inhibitor:trypsin complex remained largely conserved compared to mammalian BPTI-Kunitz inhibitor complexes. However, a prominent stabilizing role within the interface was attributed to arginine at position P3. Binding free-energy calculations indicated a 10-fold decrease for the inhibitor affinity against trypsin, if the P3 residue of ShPI-1 is mutated to alanine. Together with the increased role of Arg(11) at P3 position, slightly reduced interactions at the prime side (Pn') of the primary binding loop and at the secondary binding loop of ShPI-1 were detected. In addition, the structure provides important information for site directed mutagenesis to further optimize the activity of rShPI-1A for biotechnological applications.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The amyloid structure is essential for understanding the role of amyloids in these diseases. Amyloid formation of Ure2 protein underlies the yeast prion [URE3]. Here we use site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to investigate the structure of amyloid fibrils formed by the Ure2 prion domain. The Ure2 prion domain under study contains a Sup35M domain at C-terminus as a solubilization element. We introduced spin labels at every residue from positions 2-15, and every 5th residue from positions 20-80 in Ure2 prion domain. EPR spectra at most labeling sites show strong spin exchange interactions, suggesting a parallel in-register β structure. With quantitative analysis of spin exchange interactions, we show that residues 8-12 form the first β strand, followed by a turn at residues 13-14, and then the second β strand from residue 15 to at least residue 20. Comparison of the spin exchange frequency for the fibrils formed under quiescent and agitated conditions also revealed differences in the fibril structures. Currently there is a lack of techniques for in-depth structural studies of amyloid fibrils. Detailed structural information is obtained almost exclusively from solid-state NMR. The identification of β-strand and turn regions in this work suggests that quantitative analysis of spin exchange interactions in spin-labeled amyloid fibrils is a powerful approach for identifying the β-strand and turn/loop residues and for studying structural differences of different fibril polymorphs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

SDO shares with 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (1H2NDO) its unique ability to oxidatively cleave monohydroxylated aromatic compounds. Nevertheless SDO is more versatile with respect to 1H2NDO and other known gentisate dioxygenases (GDOs) because it cleaves not only gentisate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (1H2NC) but also salicylate and substituted salicylates. Several enzyme variants of SDO were rationally designed to simulate 1H2NDO. The basic kinetic parameters for the SDO mutants L38Q, M46V, A85H and W104Y were determined. The enzyme variants L38Q, M46V, A85H demonstrated higher catalytic efficiencies toward 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (1H2NC) compared to gentisate.

The crystal structures of the A85H and W104Y variants were solved and analyzed. The substitution of Ala85 with a histidine residue caused significant changes in the orientation of the loop containing this residue which is involved in the active site closing upon substrate binding.

Here, we present its crystal structure at 2.7 Å resolution and complex structures of the enzyme with several substrates and analogs. Two modes of substrate binding were observed at the β site of the CtCBM13 domain, and one galactobiose molecule was found in an ""L"" shaped pocket of the CtGH43 domain, which appears large enough to accommodate two more galactose units. In addition, we found that mutating Glu112 to Gln or Ala eliminated the galactan hydrolysis activity of Ct1,3Gal43A while did not disrupt its ligand binding ability. Combining this results and the crystal structure we identified Glu112 in Ct1,3Gal43A as the 'missing' essential acidic residue in galactan β-1,3-galactosidases. Structural information presented here also suggests a mechanism by which Ct1,3Gal43A bypasses β-1,6 linked branches in the substrate and another mechanism by which the substrate is delivered 'in trans' from the CBM13 domain to the catalytic GH43 domain.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Important questions linked to this popular view are: when and where is the crystallized material formed, and is amorphous solid added subsequently to the crystalline substrate? Sea urchin teeth, in which the earliest mineral forms within isolated compartments, in a time and position dependent manner, allow direct investigation of the timing of crystallization of the calcite primary plates. Living teeth of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus, in their native coelomic fluid, were examined by high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The diffraction data show that calcite is present in the most aboral portions of the plumula, representing the very earliest stages of mineralization, and that this calcite has the same crystal orientation as in the more mature adoral portions of the same tooth. Raman spectroscopy of the aboral plumula confirms the initial primary plate mineral material is calcite and does not detect amorphous calcium carbonate; in the more mature adoral incisal flange, it does detect a broader calcite peak, consistent with two or more magnesium compositions. We hypothesize that some portion of each syncytial membrane in the plumula provides the information for nucleation of identically oriented calcite crystals that subsequently develop to form the complex geometry of the single crystal sea urchin tooth.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we report the structures of two cytotoxic amyloid peptides derived from the mammalian prion protein, PrP(244-249) and PrP(245-250), determined using solid state NMR. While the amino acid composition of these two hexapeptides is very similar (ISFLIF and SFLIFL), the intermolecular interactions that give rise to the intersheet packing within the fibrils differ significantly. PrP(245-250) adopts a class 1 steric zipper, with parallel sheets stacked in an antiparallel face to face arrangement, stabilized by N- to C-terminal salt bridges. PrP(244-249), by contrast, forms two different intersheet interfaces within amyloid fibrils, with parallel opposing sheets in either a face to face (class 3) or face to back (class 2) arrangement. The fibrils formed by this peptide are primarily stabilized by close packing of the hydrophobic side chains, with contributions from side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonding (class 2 only).

SIMPLE addresses the problem of obtaining 3D reconstructions from 2D projections only, without using an input reference volume for approximating orientations. The SIMPLE reconstruction algorithm is tailored to asymmetrical and structurally heterogeneous single-particles. Its basis is global optimization with the use of Fourier common lines. The advance that enables ab initio reconstruction and heterogeneity analysis is the separation of the tasks of in-plane alignment and projection direction determination via bijective orientation search - a new concept in common lines-based strategies. Bijective orientation search divides the configuration space into two groups of paired parameters that are optimized separately. The first group consists of the rotations and shifts in the plane of the projection; the second group consists of the projection directions and state assignments. In SIMPLE, ab initio reconstruction is feasible because the 3D in-plane alignment is approximated using reference-free 2D rotational alignment. The subsequent common lines-based search hence searches projection directions and states only. Thousands of class averages are analyzed simultaneously in a matter of hours. Novice SIMPLE users get a head start via the well documented front-end. The structured, object-oriented back-end invites advanced users to develop new alignment and reconstruction algorithms.

Several of these species cause major human diseases, including Trypanosoma brucei which is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, also called sleeping sickness. These organisms have many highly unusual features including a unique U-insertion/deletion RNA editing process in the single mitochondrion. A key multi-protein complex, called the ∼20S editosome, or editosome, carries out a cascade of essential RNA-modifying reactions and contains a core of 12 different proteins of which six are the interaction proteins A1 to A6. Each of these interaction proteins comprises a C-terminal OB-fold and the smallest interaction protein A6 has been shown to interact with four other editosome OB-folds. Here we report the results of a ""linked OB-fold"" approach to obtain a view of how multiple OB-folds might interact in the core of the editosome. Constructs with variants of linked domains in 25 expression and co-expression experiments resulted in 13 soluble multi-OB-fold complexes. In several instances, these complexes were more homogeneous in size than those obtained from corresponding unlinked OB-folds. The crystal structure of A3(OB) linked to A6 could be elucidated and confirmed the tight interaction between these two OB domains as seen also in our recent complex of A3(OB) and A6 with nanobodies. In the current crystal structure of A3(OB) linked to A6, hydrophobic side chains reside in well-defined pockets of neighboring OB-fold domains. When analyzing the available crystal structures of editosome OB-folds, it appears that in five instances ""Pocket 1"" of A1(OB), A3(OB) and A6 is occupied by a hydrophobic side chain from a neighboring protein. In these three different OB-folds, Pocket 1 is formed by two conserved sequence motifs and an invariant arginine.

The crystal structure of the trimeric globular domain of human C1QTNF5 at 1.34Å resolution reveals unique features of this novel C1q family member.

S₁₆₃ forms a hydrogen bond with F₁₈₂ in a hydrophobic area extending to the hydrophobic plateau.

The new method was shown to be fast, accurate, and robust in tests with large datasets of experimental low dose cryo-EM images.

However, they considerably differ at the primary sequence level and this prevents an accurate prediction of their structural models. With the aim of expanding structural information on CHCH proteins, here we structurally characterized human CHCHD5 and CHCHD7. While CHCHD5 has two weakly interacting CHCH domains which sample a range of limited conformations as a consequence of hydrophobic interactions, CHCHD7 has a third helix hydrophobically interacting with an extension of helix α2, which is part of the CHCH domain. Upon reduction of the disulfide bonds both proteins become unstructured exposing hydrophobic patches, with the result of protein aggregation/precipitation. These results suggest a model where the molecular interactions guiding the protein recognition between Mia40 and the disulfide-reduced CHCHD5 and CHCHD7 substrates occurs in vivo when the latter proteins are partially embedded in the protein import pore of the outer membrane of mitochondria.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Magnification must be determined in order to combine data from different images in a three-dimensional reconstruction and to accurately scale reconstructions for fitting with atomic resolution models. A method is described for estimating the absolute magnification of an electron micrograph of a frozen-hydrated specimen using horse spleen apoferritin as a standard. Apoferritin is a widely available protein complex of known structure that may be included with the specimen of interest and imaged under conditions identical to those used for imaging other biological specimens by cryomicroscopy. The sum of the structure factor intensities of images of randomly-oriented apoferritin particles shows three low resolution peaks to 25Å that arise from the hollow ball structure of apoferritin. Comparison of peak positions of the experimental intensities with structure factor intensities of an atomic model of apoferritin determined by X-ray crystallography provides a scale factor for estimating the absolute magnification of the micrograph.

The development of small molecules that may act as TTR amyloid inhibitors is a promising strategy to treat these pathologies. Here we selected and characterized the interaction of flavonoids with the wild type and the V30M amyloidogenic mutant TTR. TTR acid aggregation was evaluated in vitro in the presence of the different flavonoids. The best TTR aggregation inhibitors were studied by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) in order to reveal their thermodynamic signature of binding to TTRwt. Crystal structures of TTRwt in complex with the top binders were also obtained, enabling us to in depth inspect TTR interactions with these flavonoids. The results indicate that changing the number and position of hydroxyl groups attached to the flavonoid core strongly influence flavonoid recognition by TTR, either by changing ligand affinity or its mechanism of interaction with the two sites of TTR. We also compared the results obtained for TTRwt with the V30M mutant structure in the apo form, allowing us to pinpoint structural features that may facilitate or hamper ligand binding to the V30M mutant. Our data show that the TTRwt binding site is labile and, in particular, the central region of the cavity is sensible for the small differences in the ligands tested and can be influenced by the Met30 amyloidogenic mutation, therefore playing important roles in flavonoid binding affinity, mechanism and mutant protein ligand binding specificities.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

H1 also performs functions outside cell nuclei, which may depend on its properties as a lipid-binding protein. The H1 CTD behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with coupled binding and folding. Here, we used neutral detergents and anionic SDS to study the contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the folding of the CTD. In the presence of neutral detergents, the CTD folded with proportions of secondary structure motifs similar to those observed in the DNA complexes. These results identify a folding pathway for the CTD based on hydrophobic interactions, and independent of charge compensation. The CTD is phosphorylated to different extents by cyclin-dependent kinases. The general effect of phosphorylation in the presence of detergents was a decrease in the α-helix content and an increase in that of the β-structure. The greatest effect was observed in the fully phosphorylated CTD (three phosphate groups) in the presence of anionic SDS (7:1, detergent/CTD molar ratio); in these conditions, the CTD became an all-β protein, with 83% β-structure and no α-helix. The CTD in all-β conformation readily formed ribbon-like fibers. The entire H1 also formed fibers when fully phosphorylated in the CTD. Fibers were of the amyloid type, as judged by strong birefringence in the presence of Congo red and thioflavin fluorescence enhancement. Amyloid fiber formation was only observed in SDS, suggesting that it requires the joint effects of partial charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions, together with the all-β potential provided by full phosphorylation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To evaluate the impact of this insert sequence on the catalytic efficiency, we solved the crystal structures of ManD from Escherichia coli strain K12 and its complex with D-mannonate, which reveal that this insert sequence forms two α helices locating above the active site. The two insert α helices introduce a loop that forms a cap covering the substrate binding pocket, which restricts the tunnels of substrate entering and product releasing from the active site. Site-directed mutations and enzymatic activity assays confirm that the catalytic rate is decreased by this loop. These features are conserved among Gram negative bacteria. Thus, the insert sequence of ManD from Gram negative bacteria acts as a common inducer to decrease the catalytic rate and consequently the glucuronate metabolic rate as compared to those from Gram positives.

It regulates processes including cell migration, neuronal development and phagocytosis through interactions with different proteins. In this study, Arap3, a dual GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RhoA and Arf6, was first identified to be a novel interaction partner for Vav2 both in vitro and in vivo. ITC and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments demonstrated that Vav2 SH2 domain was able to interact directly with phosphorylated Y1403 and Y1408 within the C-terminal region of Arap3 with high affinities, with the dissociation constants (Kd) of ≈ 0.27 and ≈ 1.40 μM, respectively. In addition, using different phosphotyrosine peptides, the pY +3 specificity of Vav2 SH2 domain was discovered. The solution structures of Vav2 SH2 domain in free and in complex with the phosphotyrosine peptide pY1408 were therefore determined to understand the structural basis of this recognition specificity. Structural analysis revealed that the presence of a Phe residue in the BG loop (BG6) leads to the formation of a shallow hydrophobic pY +3 pocket on the surface of Vav2 SH2 domain, which determines the pY +3 specificity of Vav2 SH2 domain.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

For arc-Aβ((1-40)) at the end of the 'lag'-period of fibrillization an abrupt appearance of ≈ 3 nm size 'spherical aggregates' with a homogeneous morphology, was identified. Then, the aggregation proceeds with a rapid growth of amyloid fibrils with a variety of morphologies, while the spherical aggregates eventually disappeared during in situ measurements. Arc-Aβ((1-40)) was also shown to form fibrils at much lower concentrations than wt-Aβ((1-40)): ≤ 2.5 μM and 12.5 μM, respectively. Moreover, at the same concentration, 50 μM, the aggregation process proceeds more rapidly for arc-Aβ((1-40)): the first amyloid fibrils were observed after c.a. 72 h from the onset of incubation as compared to approximately 7 days for wt-Aβ((1-40)). Amyloid fibrils of arc-Aβ((1-40)) exhibit a large variety of polymorphs, at least five, both coiled and non-coiled distinct fibril structures were recognized by AFM, while at least four types of arc-Aβ((1-40)) fibrils were identified by TEM and STEM and their mass-per-length statistics were collected suggesting supramolecular structures with two, four and six β-sheet laminae.

Large-field high-resolution views of biological specimens span more than four orders of magnitude in spatial scale, and, as a consequence, are rather difficult to generate directly. Various techniques have been developed towards generating those views, from increasing the sensor array size to implementing serial sectioning and montaging. Datasets and reconstructions obtained by the latter techniques generate multiple three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, that need to be combined together to provide all the multiscale information. In this work, we show how to implement montages within TxBR, a tomographic reconstruction software package. This work involves some new application of mathematical concepts related to volume preserving transformations and issues of gauge ambiguity, which are essential problems arising from the nature of the observation in an electron microscope. The purpose of TxBR is to handle those issues as generally as possible in order to correct for most distortions in the 3D reconstructions and allow for a seamless recombination of ET montages.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We previously reported that Caenorhabditis elegans CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2 (CDC-48s) are essential for the progression of meiosis I metaphase. Here, we report that CDC-48s are required for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis in C. elegans. In wild-type worms, at the diakinesis phase, phosphorylation of histone H3, one of the known substrates of aurora B kinase (AIR-2), on meiosis I chromatids correlated with AIR-2 localization at the cohesion sites of homologous chromatids. Conversely, depletion of CDC-48s resulted in a significant expansion of signals for AIR-2 and phosphorylated histone H3 over the entire length of meiotic chromosomes, leading to defective chromosome segregation, while the total amount of AIR-2 in lysates was not changed by the depletion of CDC-48s. The defective segregation of meiotic chromosomes caused by the depletion of CDC-48s was suppressed by the simultaneous depletion of AIR-2 and is similar to that observed following the depletion of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) phosphatases. However, the amount and localization of PP1 were not changed by the depletion of CDC-48s. These results suggest that CDC-48s control the restricted localization of AIR-2 to the cohesion sites of homologous chromatids in meiosis I.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Collagen configuration is important for understanding this role, in particular in mathematical models of arterial wall mechanics. In this study a new method is presented to image and quantify this configuration. Collagen in the arterial adventitia is stained with CNA35, and imaged in situ at high resolution with confocal microscopy at luminal pressures from 0 to 140mm Hg. The images are processed with a new automatic approach, utilizing techniques intended for MRI-DTI data. Collagen configuration is quantified through three parameters: the waviness, the transmural angle and the helical angle. The method is demonstrated for the case of carotid arteries of the white New Zealand rabbit. The waviness indicated a gradual straightening between 40 and 80mm Hg. The transmural angle was about zero indicating that the fibers stayed within an axial-circumferential plane at all pressures. The helical angle was characterized by a symmetrical distribution around the axial direction, indicating a double symmetrical helix.

The intrinsic or externally-generated electric field within biomaterials may also contribute to their predominant mechanical properties. Mollusc shells are well known for their outstanding mechanical properties, which are generally believed to originate from their hierarchical structures in multi-levels. This paper is therefore focused on the studies of the hierarchical structures and electromechanical coupling behaviors of clamshell from micro- to nano-levels, and in particular, the biopolymer concentrated regions. Detailed studies are performed to characterize the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of clamshell. It was found that the piezoresponse of clamshell is originated from the biopolymers between the mineral grains, as well as those intercalated within the mineral crystalline structure after the biomineralization process. Local ferroelectric hysteresis loops of clamshell have also been observed and analyzed on the samples with different orientations, biopolymer contents, or moisture contents. It is believed that the overall functioning of the clamshell or even other mollusc shells may incorporate many mechanisms interacting together, rather than originate from the hierarchical structure alone. This study of the electromechanical coupling effects of clamshell can be a path to have more comprehensive understandings of the properties and behaviors of mollusc shells.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

VCP is a very abundant protein in essentially all types of cells and is highly conserved among eukaryotes. To date, 19 different single amino acid-substitutions in VCP have been reported to cause IBMPFD (inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia), an autosomal dominant inherited human disease. Moreover, several similar single amino acid substitutions have been proposed to associate with a rare subclass of familial ALS. The mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to the pathogenesis are unclear. To elucidate potential functional differences between wild-type and pathogenic VCPs, we expressed both VCPs in yeast cdc48 mutants. We observed that all tested pathogenic VCPs suppressed the temperature-sensitive phenotype of cdc48 mutants more efficiently than wild-type VCP. In addition, pathogenic VCPs, but not wild-type VCP, were able to rescue a lethal cdc48 disruption. In yeast, pathogenic VCPs, but not wild-type VCP, formed apparent cytoplasmic foci, and these foci were transported to budding sites by the Myo2/actin-mediated transport machinery. The foci formation of pathogenic VCPs appeared to be associated with their suppression of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of cdc48 mutants. These results support the idea that the pathogenic VCP mutations create dominant gain-of-functions rather than a simple loss of functional VCP. Their unique properties in yeast could provide a convenient drug-screening system for the treatment of these diseases.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In order to gain more insight into the stoichiometry and mechanism of assembly of the complex, we heterologously expressed and purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex1p and Pex6p. Size exclusion chromatography studies of the recombinant proteins demonstrate that they form a hexameric complex in a one-to-one ratio of both AAA-proteins. The recombinant AAA-complex exhibits an ATPase activity with a k(m) of 0.17 mM and V(max) of 0.35 nmol min(-1) μg(-1). In the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, ATPase activity of the peroxisomal AAA-complex is drastically decreased and the complex dissociates.

Similarly, the mechanism by which these ATP-dependent proteases recognize their substrates currently remains unclear. Here we report the characterization of a Walker B mutation in human CLPX, in which the highly conserved glutamate was replaced with alanine. This mutant protein exhibits improved interaction with the model unfolded substrate casein and several putative physiological substrates in vitro. Although this mutant lacks ATPase activity, it retains the ability to mediate casein degradation by hCLPP, in a fashion similar to the small molecule ClpP-activator, ADEP. Our functional dissection of hCLPX structure, also identified that most model substrates are recognized by the N-terminal domain, although some substrates bypass this step and dock, directly to the pore-1 motif. Collectively these data reveal, that despite the difference between bacterial and human CLPXP complexes, human CLPXP exhibits a similar mode of substrate recognition and is deregulated by ADEPs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we study the direct relationships between presence of LB nanotemplates and unique patterns of water molecules surrounding the protein, for four model proteins for which 3D structures are available, and where crystallization conditions for each protein are the same except the presence of LB nanotemplate. Shape of frequency distribution of volumes occupied by water molecules were analyzed. They were found to be different between ""classical"" samples of different proteins, but surprisingly quite similar for LB samples. Volumes occupied by each water molecule as the function of the distance of the given molecule from the protein surface were studied. Introduction of LB film leads to appearance of water molecules close to protein surface but occupying large volumes.

During the early stages of development in the hair follicle the redox potential is such that the cysteine residues in the IF are maintained in a reduced form. However, at a late stage of development the redox potential changes to produce an oxidizing environment and the IF undergo a structural transition involving both molecular slippage and radial compaction. In our earlier study the changes in the molecular parameters were estimated from knowledge of the sites of artificially induced crosslinks, and it was noted that the changes in these parameters realigned many of the cysteine residues to positions more favorable to disulfide bond formation. As the energy involved in the formation of disulfide bonds is much greater than that of hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions the structural transition is likely to be dominated by the requirement that the bonded cysteine residues occur at closely equivalent axial positions. This criterion was used in the present study to obtain more precise values for the molecular parameters in the oxidized fiber than has hitherto been possible.

Cross sections of skeletal material were prepared and the Sr incorporated into the newly deposited skeleton analyzed by electron probe microanalysis. These regions of Sr incorporation were then correlated with skeletal ultrastructure. Massive Porites coral skeletons are composed of two types of microstructural elements - the ""centers of calcification"" and the surrounding fibrous structural region.

Calcium bodies, organs containing large amounts of calcium, have been reported in some terrestrial isopod crustaceans, but have not yet been extensively studied. We analyzed the architecture of these organs during the molt cycle in the isopod Titanethes albus. Two pairs of calcium bodies are positioned ventrolaterally in posterior pereonites of T. albus. Individual organs are epithelial sacs that contain material arranged in concentric layers delimited by thin laminae. As demonstrated by electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, abundant bacteria are present within the calcium bodies. Regardless of the molt cycle stage, crystalline concretions are present in the central areas of the calcium bodies. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of the concretions demonstrated that they are composed predominantly of calcium and phosphorus and selected area electron diffraction indicated the presence of hydroxyapatite. In molting animals, a glassy layer of mineralized matrix is formed between the envelope and the outermost lamina of the calcium body. This layer consists of an amorphous calcium mineral which contains less phosphorus than the central concretions and is resorbed after molt. Since changes in the mineralized matrix are synchronized with the molt cycle, the calcium bodies likely function as a storage compartment that complements sternal deposits as a source of calcium for the mineralization of the exoskeleton.

Oxidation of DA to its quinone and subsequent reaction with Adenine and Guanine in DNA result in the formation of depurinating adducts, thus causing DNA damage.

Various binding sites for the DA metabolite on these DNA models have been considered and our computations on the activation barriers allowed us to identify preferential bonding sites for these metabolites analogous to experiments.

Like other AAA+ machines, Hsp104 features conserved cis- and trans-acting elements, which are hallmarks of AAA+ members and are essential to Hsp104 function. Despite these similarities, it was recently proposed that Hsp104 is an atypical AAA+ ATPase, which markedly differs in 3D structure from other AAA+ machines. Consequently, it was proposed that arginines found in the non-conserved M-domain, but not the predicted Arg-fingers, serve the role of the critical trans-acting element in Hsp104. While the structural discrepancy has been resolved, the role of the Arg-finger residues in Hsp104 remains controversial. Here, we exploited the ability of Hsp104 variants featuring mutations in one ring to retain ATPase and chaperone activities, to elucidate the functional role of the predicted Arg-finger residues. We found that the evolutionarily conserved Arg-fingers are absolutely essential for ATP hydrolysis but are dispensable for hexamer assembly in Hsp104. On the other hand, M-domain arginines are not strictly required for ATP hydrolysis and affect the ATPase and chaperone activities in a complex manner. Our results confirm that Hsp104 is not an atypical AAA+ ATPase, and uses conserved structural elements common to diverse AAA+ machines to drive the mechanical unfolding of aggregated proteins.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Two of these sites were confirmed as 14-3-3 binding sites by fluorescence polarization competition and X-ray crystallography.

So far, four different families of lysozyme inhibitors have been identified including Ivy (Inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme), MliC/PliC (Membrane associated/periplasmic inhibitor of C-type lysozyme), PliI and PliG (periplasmic inhibitors of I- and G-type lysozymes, respectively). Here we provide the first crystallographic description of the PliG family. Crystal structures were obtained for the PliG homologues from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium and Aeromonas hydrophila. These structures show that the fold of the PliG family is very distinct from that of all other families of lysozyme inhibitors. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies reveal that PliG is monomeric in solution as opposed to the dimeric PliC and PliI. The PliG family shares a highly conserved SG(x)xY sequence motif with the MliC/PliC and PliI families where it was shown to reside on a loop that blocks the active site of lysozyme leading to inhibition. Surprisingly, we found that in PliG this motif is not well exposed and not involved in the inhibitory action. Instead, we could identify a distinct cluster of surface residues that are conserved across the PliG family and are essential for efficient G-type lysozyme inhibition, as evidenced by mutagenesis studies.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and related Fourier shell correlation (FSC) functions are commonly used to assess and mitigate the noise-generated error in the reconstruction. Calculation of the SSNR and FSC usually includes the noise in the solvent region surrounding the particle and therefore does not accurately reflect the signal in the particle density itself. Here we show that the SSNR in a reconstructed 3D particle map is linearly proportional to the fractional volume occupied by the particle. Using this relationship, we devise a novel filter (the ""single-particle Wiener filter"") to minimize the error in a reconstructed particle map, if the particle volume is known. Moreover, we show how to approximate this filter even when the volume of the particle is not known, by optimizing the signal within a representative interior region of the particle. We show that the new filter improves on previously proposed error-reduction schemes, including the conventional Wiener filter as well as figure-of-merit weighting, and quantify the relationship between all of these methods by theoretical analysis as well as numeric evaluation of both simulated and experimentally collected data. The single-particle Wiener filter is applicable across a broad range of existing 3D reconstruction techniques, but is particularly well suited to the Fourier inversion method, leading to an efficient and accurate implementation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In this paper we adapt the ideas of bulk-water modeling that are used in the refinement of X-ray crystal structures to the cryo-EM solvent-modeling problem. We present a continuum model for solvent density which matches MD-based results to within sampling errors.

Multiphoton microscopy is efficient in the induction of highly specific second harmonic generation (SHG) signal from non-centrosymmetric macromolecules such as fibrillar collagens. Although the detectors in the reflection geometry have been normally employed for capturing the backward scattered SHG considering the wide range of engineered thick tissue applications, there are still questions about the generated 3D collagen structures because of the directional pattern of SHG signals. The present study dealt with an in vitro collagen-fibroblast raft or bioartificial tendon model where the stimulation of fibroblast cells induced lateral orientation of collagen Type I fibers. The SHG signals originating from 3D collagen matrix were captured simultaneously in both forward and backward scattering directions. Our structural analysis indicates that collagen fibers formed in such in vitro model systems are predominantly of uniform sizes and are aligned preferentially in the lateral direction. The criss-cross arrangements of laterally oriented fibers are evident in the initial stages of contraction but eventually those laterally oriented collagen fibers are found to be aligned in parallel to each other as well as to the fibroblasts after an extended period of contraction.

Clp proteases carry out a large proportion of protein degradation in bacteria. These enzymes assemble in complexes that combine the protease ClpP and the unfoldase, ClpA or ClpX. ClpP oligomerizes as two stacked heptameric rings enclosing a central chamber containing the proteolytic sites. ClpX and ClpA assemble into hexameric rings that bind both axial surfaces of the ClpP tetradecamer forming a barrel-like complex. ClpP requires association with ClpA or ClpX to unfold and thread protein substrates through the axial pore into the inner chamber where degradation occurs. A gating mechanism regulated by the ATPase exists at the entry of the ClpP axial pore and involves the N-terminal regions of the ClpP protomers. These gating motifs are located at the axial regions of the tetradecamer but in most crystal structures they are not visible. We also lack structural information about the ClpAP or ClpXP complexes. Therefore, the structural details of how the axial gate in ClpP is regulated by the ATPases are unknown. Here, we review our current understanding of the conformational changes that ClpA or ClpX induce in ClpP to open the axial gate and increase substrate accessibility into the degradation chamber. Most of this knowledge comes from the recent crystal structures of ClpP in complex with acyldepsipeptides (ADEP) antibiotics.

We have recently shown that Cdc48p exhibits positively cooperative ATPase activity and loss of the positive cooperativity results in yeast cell death. Here we show that loss of the positive cooperativity of the yeast Cdc48p ATPase activity led to severe mitochondrial aggregation. The actin cytoskeleton and distribution of the ER-mitochondria tethering complex (ERMES) were eliminated from the cause of the mitochondrial aggregation. Instead, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein Fzo1p, which is required for mitochondrial fusion, and components of ERMES, which is involved in mitochondrial morphology, were remarkably stabilized in the Cdc48p mutants. In the last couple of years, it was shown that Vms1p functions as a cofactor of Cdc48p for the function of protein degradation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Nevertheless, we found that Vms1p was not involved in the Cdc48p-dependent mitochondrial aggregation and loss of Vms1p did not significantly affect degradation rates of proteins anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane. These results suggest that Cdc48p controls mitochondrial morphology by regulating turnover of proteins involved in mitochondrial morphology in a Vms1p-independent manner.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The H/D exchange experiment provided low resolution mapping of interaction in the homodimeric 14-3-3ζ complex. A lower level of deuteration, suggesting structural protection, of two sequential segments has been demonstrated for dimeric 14-3-3ζ wild type relative to the monomeric mutant 14-3-3ζ S58D. The N-terminal sequence (the first 27 residues) from one subunit interacts with region αC'and αD'-helices (residues 45-98) of the other molecule across the dimer interface.

The MS analysis (following tryptic in-gel digestion) employing both high resolution and tandem mass spectrometry revealed cross-linked amino acid residues. Two alternative salt bridges between Glu81 and either Lys9 or the N-terminal amino group have been found to participate in transient interactions of the 14-3-3ζ isotype homodimerization. The data obtained, which have never previously been reported, were used to modify the published 14-3-3 crystal structure using molecular modeling.

Despite the power of this system, the use of baculovirus techniques for protein expression screening is hampered by the time and resources needed to generate each recombinant baculovirus. Here, we show that a transfection/infection based expression system is suitable for screening of expression constructs in insect cells and represents a valid alternative to other traditional screening methodologies using recombinant baculovirus. The described method is based on gene delivery by transfection coupled to the induction of protein expression by non-recombinant baculovirus infection. Vectors that control expression by a combination of the baculovirus promoters ie1 and p10 and the enhancer element hr5 are among the ones suitable for this method. Infection with non-recombinant baculovirus drastically increases the basal activity of these elements, leading to protein over-expression. Multiple vectors can be simultaneously co-transfected/infected, making transfection/infection amenable for screening of multiple co-expressed proteins and protein complexes.

This work combines state-of-the-art computational methods to develop a model for the major gas vesicle protein, GvpA, and explore its structure within the assembled vesicle. Elucidating this protein's structure has been challenging due to its adherent and aggregative nature, which has so far precluded in-depth biochemical analyses. Moreover, GvpA has extremely low similarity with any known protein structure, which renders homology modeling methods ineffective. Thus, alternate approaches were used to model its tertiary structure. Starting with the sequence from haloarchaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we performed ab initio modeling and threading to acquire a multitude of structure decoys, which were equilibrated and ranked using molecular dynamics and mechanics, respectively. The highest ranked predictions exhibited an α-β-β-α secondary structure in agreement with earlier experimental findings, as well as with our own secondary structure predictions. Afterwards, GvpA subunits were docked in a quasi-periodic arrangement to investigate the assembly of the vesicle wall and to conduct simulations of contact-mode atomic force microscopy imaging, which allowed us to reconcile the structure predictions with the available experimental data. Finally, the GvpA structure for two representative organisms, Anabaena flos-aquae and Calothrix sp.

Following replication initiation, ATP hydrolysis, which is coupled to DNA replication, results in the generation of initiation-incompetent ADP-DnaA. Suppression of overinitiation of replication requires that ADP-DnaA complexes be stably maintained until the next round of replication. Thus, the functional and structural requirements that ensure stable nucleotide binding to DnaA are crucial for proper regulation of replication. Here, we demonstrate that Glu143 of DnaA, located within the AAA+ box II N-linker motif, is a key residue involved in stable nucleotide binding. A Glu143 substitution variant of DnaA (DnaA E143A) bound to ADP on ice with an affinity similar to wild-type DnaA, but the resultant ADP-DnaA E143A complex was more labile at 37 °C than wild-type ADP-DnaA complexes. Consistent with this, conversion of ADP-DnaA E143A to ATP-DnaA E143A was stimulated at 37°C in the presence of ATP, which also stimulated replication of a minichromosome in an in vitro reconstitution reaction. Expression of DnaA E143A in vivo inhibited cell growth in an oriC-dependent manner, suggesting that DnaA E143A caused over-initiation of replication, consistent with the in vitro results.

ECP has a high binding affinity for heterosaccharides, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides and heparan sulfate found in the glycocalix of eukaryotic cells. We have crystallized ECP in complex with sulfate anions in a new monoclinic crystal form. In this form, the active site groove is exposed, providing an alternative model for ligand binding studies. By exploring the protein-sulfate complex, we have defined the sulfate binding site architecture. Three main sites (S1-S3) are located in the protein active site; S1 and S2 overlap with the phosphate binding sites involved in RNase nucleotide recognition. A new site (S3) that is unique to ECP is one of the key anchoring points for sulfated ligands. Arg 1 and Arg 7 in S3, together with Arg 34 and Arg 36 in S1, form the main basic clusters that assist in the recognition of ligand anionic groups. The location of additional sulfate bound molecules, some of which contribute to the crystal packing, may mimic the binding to extended anionic polymers. In conclusion, the structural data define a binding pattern for the recognition of sulfated molecules that can modulate the role of ECP in innate immunity.

Although the mechanism of such cooperativity is unknown it might be related to the mechanism of bending. To explore the mechanism by which structural heterogeneity of axonemal dyneins is induced by nucleotides, we used cilia from Tetrahymena thermophila to examine the structure of dyneins in a) the intact axoneme and b) microtubule doublets separated from the axoneme, both with and without additional pure microtubules. We also employed an ATPase assay on these specimens to investigate dynein activity functionally. Dyneins on separated doublets show more activation by nucleotides than those in the intact axoneme, both structurally and in the ATPase assay, and this is especially pronounced when the doublets are coupled with added microtubules, as expected. Paralleling the reduced ATPase activity in the intact axonemes, a lower proportion of these dyneins are in the nucleotide-bound form. This indicates a coordinated suppression of dynein activity in the axoneme, which could be the key for understanding the bending mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, the method for vitrifying specimens onto EM grids is essentially unchanged - application of ∼3 μL sample to a grid, followed by blotting and rapid plunge freezing into liquid ethane. Several trials are often required to obtain suitable thin (few hundred nanometers or less) vitrified layers amenable for cryo-TEM imaging, which results in waste of precious sample and resources. While commercially available instruments provide some level of automation to control the vitrification process in an effort to increase quality and reproducibility, obtaining satisfactory vitrified specimens remains a bottleneck in the Cryo-TEM pipeline. We describe here a completely novel method for EM specimen preparation based on small volume (picoliter to nanoliter) dispensing using inkjet technology. A first prototype system (Spotiton v0.5) demonstrates feasibility of this new approach for specimen vitrification. A piezo-electric inkjet dispenser is integrated with optical real-time cameras (100 Hz frame rate) to analyze picoliter to nanoliter droplet profiles in-flight and spreading dynamics on the grid, and thus provides a method to optimize timing of the process. Using TEM imaging and biochemical assays we demonstrate that the piezo-electric inkjet mechanism does not disrupt the structural or functional integrity of macromolecules. These preliminary studies provide insight into the factors and components that will need further development to enable a robust and repeatable technique for specimen vitrification using this novel approach.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

This paper proposes a more flexible algorithm that adaptively chooses the basis based on the data. Because the basis adapts to the data, the reconstruction resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved compared to a reconstruction with a fixed basis. Moreover, the algorithm automatically masks the particle, thereby separating it from the background. This eliminates the need for ad hoc filtering or masking in the refinement loop. The algorithm is formulated in a Bayesian maximum-a-posteriori framework and uses an efficient optimization algorithm for the maximization. Evaluations using simulated and actual cryogenic electron microscopy data show resolution and SNR improvements as well as the effective masking of particle from background.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The methylcytidine interacts with the P-site codon of the mRNA and increases ribosomal decoding fidelity. In this study, high resolution crystal structure (2.25Å) of Escherichia coli RsmH in complex with AdoMet and cytidine (the putative rRNA binding site) was determined. The structural analysis demonstrated that the complex consists of two distinct but structurally related domains: the typical MTase domain and the putative substrate recognition and binding domain. A deep pocket was found in the conserved AdoMet binding domain. It was also found that the cytidine bound far from AdoMet with the distance of 25.9Å. It indicates that the complex is not in a catalytically active state, and structural rearrangement of RsmH or the nucleotides neighboring C1402 may be necessary to trigger catalysis. Although there is only one molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystals, RsmH can form a compact dimer across a crystallographic twofold axis. Further analysis of RsmH by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) also revealed the dimer in solution, but with a more flexible conformation than that in crystal, likely resulting from the absence of the substrate. It implies that an active status of RsmH in vivo is achieved by a formation of the dimeric architecture. In general, crystal and solution structural analysis provides new information on the mechanism of the methylation of the fine-tuning ribosomal decoding center by the RsmH.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Currently, compartmentalisation is studied using methodologies that oversimplify the bone tissue complexity. Here, we present a new methodological approach that integrates a histological description and a mineral content analysis to study the compartmentalisation of the whole mineralised and non-mineralised tissues (i.e., spatial distribution in long bone sections). This new methodology, based on Geographical Information System (GIS) software, allows us to draw areas of interest (i.e., tracing vectorial shapes which are quantifiable) in raw images that are extracted from microscope and compared them spatially in a semi-automatic and quantitative fashion. As an example of our methodology, we have studied the tibiae from individuals with different age at death (infant, juvenile and adult). The tibia's cortical bone presents a well-formed fibrolamellar bone, in which remodelling is clearly evidenced from early ontogeny, and we discuss the existence of ""lines of arrested growth"". Concurrent with the histological variation, Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy analyses corroborate that the mineral content in the cortical bone changes differentially. The anterior portion of the tibia remains highly pierced and is less crystalline than the rest of the cortex during growth, which is evidence of more active and continuous remodelling. Finally, while porosity and other ""non-mineralised cavities"" are largely modified, the mineralised portion and the marrow cavity size persist proportionally during ontogeny.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Several wild-type SQR structures have been reported recently. However, the enzymatic mechanism of SQR has not been fully delineated. In order to understand the role of the catalytically essential residues in the enzymatic mechanism of SQR we produced a number of variants of the conserved residues in the catalytic site including the cysteine triad of SQR from the acidophilic, chemolithotrophic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. These were structurally characterized and their activities for each reaction step were determined. In addition, the crystal structures of the wild-type SQR with sodium selenide and gold(I) cyanide have been determined. Previously we proposed a mechanism for the reduction of sulfides to elemental sulfur involving nucleophilic attack of Cys356 on C(4A) atom of FAD.

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) confirmed that basopinacocytes form a discontinuous layer of flattened cells covering the skeleton and display ultrastructural features attesting intense secretory activity. The production of a highly structured fibrillar organic matrix framework by basopinacocytes toward the growing skeleton was highlighted both by potassium pyroantimonate and ruthenium red protocols, the latter further suggesting the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the matrix.

E2s are multi-domain proteins, with accessory N-terminal or C-terminal domains that can contribute to the specificity for the cognate Ub-like molecules, or even the E3. In this context, the thorough structural characterization of E2 accessory domains is mandatory, in particular when they are associated to specific functions. We here provide, by computational and comparative studies, the first evidence of an acidic domain (AD) conserved in the E2 sub-family 3R. It is an intrinsically disordered domain, in which elements for Ub or E3 recognition are maintained. This conserved acidic domain (AD) shows propensity for α-helix structures (185-192 and 204-218) in the proximity of the sites for interaction with the Ub or the cognate E3. Moreover, our results also suggest that AD can explore conformations with tertiary contacts mainly driven by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions, in absence of its interaction partners. The globular states are likely to be regulated by multiple phosphorylation events, which can trigger conformational changes toward more extended conformations, as judged by MD simulations of the phospho-variants. The extended conformations, in turn, promote the accessibility of the interaction sites for Ub and the E3. We also trace a parallel between this new and natively unfolded structural motif for Ub-recognition and the natively folded ubiquitin associated domain (UBA) typical of family 1 of E2 enzymes, which includes Ubc1. In fact, according to our calculations, Ubc1 maps at the interface between the space of the natively unfolded and folded proteins, as well as it shares common features with the acidic domain of family 3 members.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We here demonstrate that the human sperm-specific isoform of PKA named Cα2 is important for sperm motility and thus male fertility. Furthermore, we report on the first three-dimensional crystal structure of human apo Cα2 to 2.1 Å. Apo Cα2 displays an open conformation similar to the well-characterized apo structure of murine Cα1. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules and the core of the small lobe is rotated by almost 13° in the A molecule relative to the B molecule. In addition, a salt bridge between Lys72 and Glu91 was observed for Cα2 in the apo-form, a conformation previously found only in dimeric or ternary complexes of Cα1. Human Cα2 and Cα1 share primary structure with the exception of the amino acids at the N-terminus coded for by an alternative exon 1. The N-terminal glycine of Cα1 is myristoylated and this aliphatic chain anchors the N-terminus to an intramolecular hydrophobic pocket. Cα2 cannot be myristoylated and the crystal structure revealed that the equivalent hydrophobic pocket is unoccupied and exposed.

Due to ease of its purification and crystallization OmpF can be used as a benchmark protein for establishing membrane protein crystallization in meso, as a ""membrane lyzozyme"". The packing of porin trimers in the crystals of space group H32 is similar to natural outer membranes, providing the first high-resolution insight into the close to native packing of OmpF. Surprisingly, interaction between trimers is mediated exclusively by lipids, without direct protein-protein contacts. Multiple ordered lipids are observed and many of them occupy identical positions independently of the space group, identifying preferential interaction sites of lipid acyl chains.

Consequently, there is a considerable need to accurately measure volumes of both individual cells and cell populations as a function of time. In this study, we have monitored cell volume changes in real time during apoptosis using digital holographic microscopy. Cell volume changes were deduced from the measured phase change of light transmitted through cells. Our digital holographic experiments showed that after exposure to 1 μM staurosporine for 4 h, the volumes of KB cells were reduced by ~50-60%, which is consistent with previous results obtained using electronic cell sizing and atomic force microscopy. In comparison with other techniques, digital holographic microscopy is advantageous because it employs noninvasive detection, has high time resolution, real time measurement capability, and the ability to simultaneously investigate time-dependent volume changes of both individual cells and cell populations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Mechanistically, p97 cooperates with its cofactor Ufd1-Npl4 in these processes to segregate polyubiquitinated misfolded or regulatory client proteins from intracellular structures for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Recent work now connects p97, independently of Ufd1-Npl4, to endosomal trafficking and autophagy. Interestingly, these pathways also deliver proteins for degradation, albeit by the lysosome.

The conference covered recent software and hardware developments as well as exciting applications exemplifying the diversity of biological fields in which electron tomography is considered as a central technique. Electron tomography and cryo-electron tomography in particular, became the method of choice for acquiring insights into the molecular organization and architecture of tissues, cells, organelles, and macromolecular assemblies, in situ. It is now considered to play a pivotal roll in answering fundamental questions in cellular and structural biology. The field of electron tomography has grown tremendously during the last decade as a result of improved software for 3D averaging and visualization of 3D images, the development of larger cameras and direct detection chips, as well as fully automated and high-throughput tilt-series collection systems for electron microscopes. Yet, there remains considerable room for improvement, especially in algorithms for classification of subtomograms and feature segmentation, as well as camera improvements, correlative light and electron microscopy and advanced specimen preparation techniques. Contributions to this special issue also address some of these issues. The application of cryo-electron tomography is of great interest since it provides the means for studying tissues and cells captured in a close-to-native state, but the methodology still requires a high level of expertise.

The nominal resolution of subtomograms can be significantly increased when individual subtomograms of the same kind are aligned and averaged. A vital step for such a procedure are algorithms that speedup subtomogram alignment and improve its accuracy to allow reference-free subtomogram classifications. Such methods will facilitate automation of tomography analysis and overall high throughput in the data processing. Building on previous work, here we propose a fast rotational alignment method that uses the Fourier equivalent form of a popular constrained correlation measure that considers missing wedge corrections and density variances in the subtomograms. The fast rotational search is based on 3D volumetric matching, which improves the rotational alignment accuracy in particular for highly distorted subtomograms with low SNR and tilt angle ranges in comparison to fast rotational matching of projected 2D spherical images. We further integrate our fast rotational alignment method in a reference-free iterative subtomogram classification scheme, and propose a local feature enhancement strategy in the classification process.

Using electron microscopy and image processing techniques several structural conformations can be observed. Prior to the conditions that induce amyloid formation and at its initial stage, microcin E492 molecules can be found in two main types of oligomers: a pentameric, pore-like structure consisting of globular monomers of ∼25Å diameter, and long filaments made up of stacked pentamers. The equilibrium between these structures depends on the properties of the solvent, because samples kept in methanol mainly show the pentameric structure. Amyloid induction in aqueous solvent reveals the presence, together with the above mentioned structures, of several amyloid structures such as flat and helical filaments. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the fibrils formed by microcin E492 presented cross-β structure, a distinctive property of amyloid fibrils. Based on the study of the observed structures we propose that microcin E492 has two conformations: a native one that assembles mainly into a pentameric structure, which functions as a pore, and an amyloid conformation which results in the formation of different types of amyloid filaments.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

For instance, the eukaryotic protein filamin interacts with many proteins and is crucial for the cytoskeleton. The functional properties of long repeat domains are governed by the specific properties of each individual domain as well as by the repeat copy number. To provide better understanding of the evolutionary and functional history of repeating domains, we investigated the mode of evolution of the filamin domain in some detail. Among the domains that are common in long repeat proteins, sushi and spectrin domains evolve primarily through cassette tandem duplications while scavenger and immunoglobulin repeats appear to evolve through clustered tandem duplications. Additionally, immunoglobulin and filamin repeats exhibit a unique pattern where every other domain shows high sequence similarity. This pattern may be the result of tandem duplications, serve to avert aggregation between adjacent domains or it is the result of functional constraints. In filamin, our studies confirm the presence of interspersed integrin binding domains in vertebrates, while invertebrates exhibit more varied patterns, including more clustered integrin binding domains. The most notable case is leech filamin, which contains a 20 repeat expansion and exhibits unique dimerization topology. Clearly, invertebrate filamins are varied and contain examples of similar adjacent integrin-binding domains. Given that invertebrate integrin shows more similarity to the weaker filamin binder, integrin β3, it is possible that the distance between integrin-binding domains is not as crucial for invertebrate filamins as for vertebrates.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

To avoid their own suicide through reuptake of secreted bacteriocins, these bacteria protect themselves by co-expression of immunity proteins in the compartment of colicin destination. In Escherichia coli the colicin M (Cma) is inactivated by the interaction with the Cma immunity protein (Cmi). We have crystallized and solved the structure of Cmi at a resolution of 1.95Å by the recently developed ab initio phasing program ARCIMBOLDO.

Dimerization of this fold is mediated by an extended interface of hydrogen bond interactions between the α-helix and the four-stranded β-sheet of the symmetry related molecule. Two intermolecular disulfide bridges covalently connect this dimer to further lock this complex. The Cmi protein resembles an example of a 3D domain swapping being stalled through physical linkage. The dimer is a highly charged complex with a significant surplus of negative charges presumably responsible for interactions with Cma. Dimerization of Cmi was also demonstrated to occur in vivo.

Our data show that the particle motion is correlated within patches of 0.3-0.5 μm, indicating that the whole ice layer is moving in a drum-like motion, with accompanying particle rotations of up to a few degrees. Support films with smaller holes, as well as lower electron dose rates tend to reduce beam-induced specimen motion, consistent with a mechanical effect.

As in marine mussels, this attachment is achieved by a proteinaceous byssus, a series of threads joined at a stem that connect the mussel to adhesive plaques secreted onto the substrate. Although the zebra mussel byssus is superficially similar to marine mussels, significant structural and compositional differences suggest that further investigation of the adhesion mechanisms in this freshwater species is warranted. Here we present an ultrastructural examination of the zebra mussel byssus, with emphasis on interfaces that are critical to its adhesive function. By examining the attached plaques, we show that adhesion is mediated by a uniform electron dense layer on the underside of the plaque. This layer is only 10-20 nm thick and makes direct and continuous contact with the substrate. The plaque itself is fibrous, and curiously can exhibit either a dense or porous morphology. In zebra mussels, a graded interface between the animal and the substrate mussels is achieved by interdigitation of uniform threads with the stem, in contrast to marine mussels, where the threads themselves are non-uniform. Our observations of several novel aspects of zebra mussel byssal ultrastructure may have important implications not only for preventing biofouling by the zebra mussel, but for the development of new bioadhesives as well.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

With its ability to penetrate whole hydrated cells it is ideally suited for pairing fluorescence light microscopy and nanoscale X-ray tomography. In this paper, we describe the X-ray optical set-up and the design of the cryo full-field transmission X-ray microscope (TXM) at the electron storage ring BESSY II. Compared to previous TXM set-ups with zone plate condenser monochromator, the new X-ray optical layout employs an undulator source, a spherical grating monochromator and an elliptically shaped glass capillary mirror as condenser. This set-up improves the spectral resolution by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the partially coherent object illumination improves the contrast transfer of the microscope compared to incoherent conditions. With the new TXM, cells grown on flat support grids can be tilted perpendicular to the optical axis without any geometrical restrictions by the previously required pinhole for the zone plate monochromator close to the sample plane. We also developed an incorporated fluorescence light microscope which permits to record fluorescence, bright field and DIC images of cryogenic cells inside the TXM. For TXM tomography, imaging with multi-keV X-rays is a straightforward approach to increase the depth of focus. Under these conditions phase contrast imaging is necessary. For soft X-rays with shrinking depth of focus towards 10nm spatial resolution, thin optical sections through a thick specimen might be obtained by deconvolution X-ray microscopy.

As recently reviewed in this journal (Volume 172, Issue 2 (2010)), the use of multiple, correlated methods is a powerful way to extend the analytical properties of each individual technique, normally resulting in more informative insights by overcoming the various limitations of the individual methods. In this context, there is an increasing demand for more fully quantitative approaches to image cells in a near to native state, a demand that is hardly satisfied by presently available methods. The emerging possibilities related to the use of X-rays to image intact, hydrated biological material thus present interesting new tools. The high penetrating power of X-rays, combined with recent advances in X-ray optics, have led to a number of very interesting results in three-dimensional analysis of biological samples. This focused issue aims to bring together a number of recent advances in the use of X-ray microscopy for structural analysis and chemical mapping of biological materials. This is a good moment to highlight work in this emerging field, as the use of soft X-rays and Fresnel zone plates now result in microscopes showing resolutions up to 20 nm. This special issue includes reports on the use of such instruments for three-dimensional imaging, using tomographic reconstructions of frozen cells in a fully hydrated state. Comparison of these tomographic reconstructions with data obtained by electron microscopy allows one to estimate both the possibilities and the limitations of x-ray based microscopy in the determination of cellular features. The possibility to detect different viral forms within eukaryotic cells also highlights the resolution level presently attainable using cryo X-ray tomography. The use of correlative approaches, combining, for example, the use of fluorescent probes for light microscopy with the X-ray microscopy analysis of frozen samples, has proven to be a powerful way to select the appropriate cells to image in further detail. As an example, light microscopy can be used to detect fluorophoretagged viral proteins within the mammalian cell environment, and X-ray microscopy can then be used to characterize virus-induced structures in the same cells. Another application of soft X-rays employs quantitative measurement of the absorption of X-rays, which is used to obtain, at the same time, cell morphology and a detailed estimation of the content of a cellular component (hemoglobin) in the host infected by a large protozoan cell at different states of its life cycle.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

All these P complexes retain the authentic antigenicity and carbohydrate-binding function of the norovirus capsid. They have been used as tools to study norovirus-host interactions, and the 24-mer P particle has been proposed as a vaccine and vaccine platform against norovirus and other pathogens. In view of their pharmaceutical interest it is important to characterise the structure, stability and dynamics of these protein complexes. Here we use a native mass spectrometric approach. We analyse the P particles under both non-reducing and reducing conditions, as it is known that the macromolecular assemblies are stabilised by inter-subunit disulphide bonding. A novel 18-mer complex is identified, and we show that under reducing conditions the 24-mer dissociates into P dimers that reassemble into the 12-mer small P particle and another novel 36-mer complex.

However, these markers can create artifacts that occlude a specimen due to their high contrast, which can also cause failure of some image processing algorithms. One way of reducing these artifacts is to replace high contrast objects with pixel densities that blend into the surroundings in the projection domain before volume reconstruction. In this paper, we propose digital inpainting via compressed sensing (CS) as a new method to achieve this goal. We show that cryo-ET projections are sparse in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, and, by finding the sparsest DCT domain decompositions given uncorrupted pixels, we can fill in the missing pixel values that are occluded by high contrast objects without discontinuities. Our method reduces visual artifacts both in projections and in tomograms better than conventional algorithms, such as polynomial interpolation and random noise inpainting.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Because few of the engineered channel proteins have been crystallized, solution studies based on Neutron Scattering, Circular Dichroism and NMR play a major role. Consequently, the understanding of membrane proteins dynamics in water/detergent solutions or when embedded in a lipid membrane, can clarify how the environment affects protein behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations of the FhuA Escherichia coli outer membrane channel protein and its engineered FhuA Δ1-159 variant have been performed in two different environments: a DNPC (1,2-dinervonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) lipid bilayer and a water/OES (N-octyl-2-hydroxyethyl sulfoxide) detergent solution.

X-ray micro-computed tomography and 3D printing elucidate the mechanism of conformational change from a passive (slightly curved, attached to surface) to a defensive (rolled, detached from surface) state of the plate assembly. The passive and defensive conformations exhibited differences in longitudinal curvature index (0.43 vs. 0.70), average plate-to-plate overlap (∼62% vs. ∼48%), cross-sectional overlap heterogeneity (60-82.5% vs. 0-90%, fourth plate), and plate-to-plate separation distance (100% increase in normalized separation distance between plates 4 and 5), respectively. The plate-to-plate interconnections consist of two rigid plates joined by a compliant, actuating muscle, analogous to a geometrically structured shear lap joint. This work provides an understanding of how T. marmorea achieves the balance between mobility and protection. In the passive state, the morphometry of the plates and plate-to-plate interconnections results in an approximately continuous curvature and constant armor thickness, resulting in limited mobility but maximum protection. In the defensive state, the underlying soft tissues gain protection and the chiton gains mobility through tidal flow, but regions of vulnerability open dorsally, due to the increase in plate-to-plate separation and decrease in plate-to-plate overlap. Lastly, experiments using optical and scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy explore the microstructure and spatial distribution of the six layers within the intermediate plates, the role of multilayering in resisting predatory attacks, and the detection of chitin as a major component of the intra-plate organic matrix and girdle.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Neutron diffraction studies were conducted using the IBARAKI Biological Crystal Diffractometer with the time-of-flight method.

This hydrogen-bond network is composed of Thr75, Trp79, His88, Ser112, Pro113, Thr118-B and four water molecules, and is involved in both monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interactions, suggesting that the double protonation of His88 by acidification breaks the hydrogen-bond network and causes the destabilization of the TTR tetramer. In addition, the comparison with X-ray structure at pH 4.0 indicated that the protonation occurred to Asp74, His88 and Glu89 at pH 4.0.

Here we describe the application of one such fragmentation method, combinatorial domain hunting (CDH), to a target which historically was difficult to express, human MEK-1. We show how CDH was used to identify a fragment which covers the kinase domain of MEK-1 and which expresses and crystallizes significantly better than designed expression constructs, and we report the crystal structure of this fragment which explains some of its superior properties.

Over the last 26 years, Ueli has served as Founding Director and Professor of the Maurice E. Müller Institute for Structural Biology. During this time, Ueli’s infectious ‘‘simplicity is key to success’’ dogma and collaborative inter-disciplinary spirit has influenced many laboratories all over the world, going far beyond his 300 journal articles and reviews that have amassed almost 16,000 citations thus far. The ‘‘integrated approach,’’ to use another Ueli-ism, is one visionary characteristic that sets him apart from the egocentrism of classical ‘‘Narcissus-type’’ research. Ueli Aebi studied physics and mathematics at the University of Bern from 1967 to 1972. As destiny would not have it, a gamechanging discussion with the preeminent orthopedic surgeon (and his then future father-in-law) Maurice E. Müller lured Ueli away from pursuing a Ph.D. in theoretical physics with the Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman instead re-focusing his gaze onto ‘‘real’’ problems i.e., the life sciences. This led Ueli to the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, where his sidetrack into biology was to be irrevocably cemented. There, he went under the tutelage of world-renowned phage biologist and electron microscopist Eduard Kellenberger who at the time had just cofounded the Biozentrum. Ueli, ever the prodigious prankster, had published an astounding 15 papers by the time he obtained his Ph.D. in Biophysics in 1977. Then with a Swiss career development award in hand, Ueli and his wife Janine Aebi-Müller moved with their three small children to the University of California at Los Angeles, where he worked as a Senior Research Associate for two years. The family subsequently moved again this time to Baltimore where Ueli rose from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine between 1979 and 1986. It was at Johns Hopkins where he began his lifelong work with the basic molecular components that govern cell structure in metazoan cells. Among Ueli’s notable contributions, his structure-based functional approach to crack biological problems has led to fundamental advances in our understanding of amyloid fibrillogenesis, intermediate filaments, the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes that facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport. Then in 1985, together with his colleague Andreas Engel, Ueli responded to a call to establish a structural biology division at the Biozentrum – the Maurice E.

To address this, systematic surveys by molecular dynamics simulations and entropy analysis were performed on the p53 core domain in this work. We examined seven wild/mutant X-ray structures and observed two types of water-network hydration in three ""hot hydration centers"" (DNA- or small molecule- binding surfaces of the p53 core domain). The ""tight"" water, resulting from the local collective hydrogen-bond interactions, is probably fundamental to the protein structural stability. The second type of water is highly ""dynamical"" and exchanges very fast within the bulk solution, which is unambiguously assisted by the local protein motions. An entropy mapping of the solvent around the protein and a temperature perturbation analysis further present the main features of the p53 hydration network.

Cancer cells become addicted to high levels of CK2 activity and therefore this kinase is a remarkable example of ""non-oncogene addiction"". CK2 is a validated target for cancer therapy with one inhibitor in phase I clinical trials. Several crystal structures of CK2 are available, many in complex with ATP-competitive inhibitors, showing the presence of regions with remarkable flexibility.

We confirm previous findings about the unique flexibility of the CK2α catalytic subunit in the hinge/αD region, the p-loop and the β4β5 loop, and show here that there is no clear-cut correlation between the conformations of these flexible zones. Our findings challenge some of the current interpretations on the functional role of these regions and dispute the hypothesis that small ligands stabilize an inactive state. The mobility of the hinge/αD region in the human enzyme is unique among protein kinases, and this can be exploited for the development of more selective ATP-competitive inhibitors.

 Abstract
 
 We have performed full-field cryo X-ray microscopy in the water window photon energy range on vaccinia virus (VACV) infected cells to produce tomographic reconstructions. PtK2 cells were infected with a GFP-expressing VACV strain and frozen by plunge fast freezing. The infected cells were selected by light fluorescence microscopy of the GFP marker and subsequently imaged in the X-ray microscope under cryogenic conditions. Tomographic tilt series of X-ray images were used to yield three-dimensional reconstructions showing different cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, filaments), together with other structures derived from the virus infection. Among them, it was possible to detect viral factories and two types of viral particles related to different maturation steps of VACV (immature and mature particles), which were compared to images obtained by standard electron microscopy of the same type of cells. In addition, the effect of radiation damage during X-ray tomographic acquisition was analyzed. Thin sections studied by electron microscopy revealed that the morphological features of the cells do not present noticeable changes after irradiation. Our findings show that cryo X-ray nano-tomography is a powerful tool for collecting three-dimensional structural information from frozen, unfixed, unstained whole cells with sufficient resolution to detect different virus particles exhibiting distinct maturation levels.

A TLR5 homology model was generated and fitted into the electron microscopy structure. All seven predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are exposed on the molecular surface, away from the dimer interface. Glycosylation at the first five sites was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry.

We examined whether their relative volumes change during the intracellular cycle. Stereological analysis of random ultrathin sections taken at 5min of interaction, 7 and 24h post-infection demonstrated that the relative volume of each type of organelle decreases just after the respective peak of secretion. Micronemes are radially arranged below the polar ring, while rhoptries converge to but only a few reach the inside of the conoid. In contrast to the apical and polarized organelles, dense granules were found scattered throughout the cytoplasm, with no preferential location in the parasite cell body. Extensive observation of random sections indicated that each organelle probably secretes in a different region. Micronemes secrete just below the posterior ring and probably require that the conoid is extruded. The rhoptries passing through the conoid secrete at a porosome-like point at the most apical region. Dense granules secrete laterally, probably at fenestrations in the inner membrane complex. Immunocytochemistry showed that there are no subpopulations of rhoptries or dense granules, as a single organelle can contain more than one kind of its specific proteins.
