Digestion, taxon and water [O2] all had significant effects on the pre-exercise oxygen consumption rate $$ (\dot{M}{\text{O}}_{{ 2 {\text{pre-exercise}}}} ) $$ and the swimming performance (P < 0.05). Among the three fishes, qingbo showed the highest swimming performance and the lowest feeding $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ at the saturated water [O2], and its active oxygen consumption rate $$ (\dot{M}{\text{O}}_{{ 2 {\text{active}}}} ) $$ and critical swimming speed (Ucrit) decreased the most with decreases in water [O2]. Qingbo exhibited a locomotion-priority metabolic mode at all three water [O2]. Digestion was sacrificed to locomotion in a postprandial swimming situation, but fed qingbo could not maintain their Ucrit at water [O2] of 2 and 1 mg L−1. Goldfish showed the lowest swimming performance and the highest feeding $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ at the saturated water [O2]. They exhibited a digestion-priority metabolic mode at high water [O2]. However, with a decrease in water [O2], the feeding $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ decreased more acutely than the respiratory capacity; thus, digestion and locomotion performed independently in a postprandial swimming situation (i.e., an additive metabolic mode) at a water [O2] of 1 mg L−1. The common carp showed moderate and balanced swimming performance and feeding $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ at the saturated water [O2], and exhibited an additive metabolic mode at all 3 water [O2], because digestion, swimming and respiratory capacities decreased in parallel with the decrease in water [O2].",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

I also attempted to reconstruct ancestral normothermic rest-phase body temperature states using a maximum parsimony approach. Body temperature at the familial level is not correlated with body mass. For small mammals, except the Macroscelidae, previously identified correlates, such as climate adaptation and zoogeography explained some, but not all, Tb apomorphies. At the species level in large cursorial mammals, there was a significant correlation between body temperature and the ratio between metatarsal length and femur length, the proxy for stride length and cursoriality. With the exception of two primate families, all supraendothermic (Tb > 37.9°C) mammals are cursorial, including Artiodactyla, Lagomorpha, some large Rodentia, and Carnivora. The ruminant supraendothermic cursorial pulse is putatively associated with global cooling and vegetation changes following the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Reconstructed ancestral body temperatures were highly unrealistic deep within the mammalian phylogeny because of the lack of fossil Tb data that effectively creates ghost lineages. However, it is anticipated that the method of estimating body temperature from the abundance of 13C–18O bonds in the carbonate component of tooth bioapatite in both extant and extinct animals may be a very promising tool for estimating the Tb of extinct mammals. Fossil Tb data are essential for discerning derived Tb reversals from ancestral states, and verifying the dates of supraendothermic pulses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The ability to thermally acclimate to offset temperature effects on physiological function is prevalent in ectotherms that are unable to thermoregulate year-round to maintain performance. In this study we examined the physiological and behavioural consequences of long-term exposure to different water temperatures in the aquatic snake Acrochordus arafurae. We hypothesised that long dives would benefit this species by reducing the likelihood of avian predation. To achieve longer dives at high temperatures, we predicted that thermal acclimation of A. arafurae would reduce metabolic rate and increase use of aquatic respiration. Acrochordus arafurae were held at 24 or 32°C for 3 months before dive duration and physiological factors were assessed (at both 24 and 32°C). Although filesnakes demonstrated thermal acclimation of metabolic rate, use of aquatic respiration was thermally independent and did not acclimate. Mean dive duration did not differ between the acclimation groups at either temperature; however, warm-acclimated animals increased maximum and modal dive duration, demonstrating a longer dive duration capacity. Our study established that A. arafurae is capable of thermal acclimation and this confers a benefit to the diving abilities of this snake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

First, the full sequence of pejerrey PRP-PACAP was obtained by RT-PCR, using primers based on conserved fragments of teleosts PACAP sequences. The growth of the fish at 83 days after hatching (dah) and the GH mRNA levels were not significantly affected by the dietary treatment. Conversely, PRP-PACAP expression significantly decreased with increasing dietary lipids (L10 > L21). While GH receptor (GHR)-I and IGF-I transcripts did not differ among groups, GHR-II transcripts decreased in group L21. IGF-II expression apparently followed the same trend. These results in combination with the lower expression of the anorexigenic PRP-PACAP in fish fed diet L21 and the correlation analysis evidencing a particularly fine tuning of the GH–IGF system in group L13, suggest that this diet may cover the energy demands for growing pejerrey from 27 dah onwards. Our results show for first time in fish a differential response of PRP-PACAP transcripts to dietary manipulations, and confirm the sensitivity of the pejerrey GH–IGF system to changes in diet composition despite the lack of (or in advance to) a clear response of somatic growth.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Male moths locate mates by tracking sex pheromone emitted by conspecific females. During this type of behavior, males exhibit a combination of upwind surge and zigzagging flight. Similarly, the male walking moth Bombyx mori responds to transient pheromone exposure with a surge in movement, followed by sustained zigzagging walking. The initial surge direction is known to be influenced by the pheromone input pattern. Here, we identified the sensory input patterns that determine the initial walking direction of males. We first quantified the stimulus by measuring electroantennogram values, which were used as a reference for subsequent tests. We used a brief stimulus pulse to examine the relationship between sensory stimulus patterns and the turning direction of initial surge. We found that the difference in input timing and intensity between left and right antennae affected the walking direction, indicating that B. mori integrate bilateral pheromone information during orientation behavior. When we tested pheromone stimulation for longer periods, turning behavior was suppressed, which was induced by stimulus cessation. This study contributes toward understanding efficient strategies for odor-source localization that is utilized by walking insects.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we apply the geometric framework, a modelling approach for investigating how animals balance nutrient needs in multidimensional and dynamic nutritional environments, to captive whitebellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala). We address the question of how these small birds (~8 g) prioritise sugar and water intake, and how dietary salt content interacts with sugar and water intake. Sunbirds kept at 20°C and provided with moderate to high sucrose concentrations (≥1 M), together with supplementary water, converge on an intake target of 2.79 g day−1 of sucrose and 7.72 g day−1 of water: equivalent to 0.85 M sucrose. When the birds are given more dilute sucrose concentrations, they defend their sugar intake by over-ingesting water, up to a ceiling of 47 g day−1. Sugar intake thus gets priority over water intake, but the birds have a finite capacity to over-ingest water to gain the target level of sugar. Regulation appears to be less precise when birds are given a choice between two sucrose solutions than when they choose between a sugar solution and supplementary water. Intake targets vary in response to internal and external factors, and sunbirds increase their sugar intake in response to increased activity and cold, irrespective of nectar concentration. They also compensate for interruptions in foraging activity, whether overnight or during the day. Interactive effects become evident when sodium is included as a third nutrient: on very dilute nectar (≤0.1 M), where sunbirds lose body mass, the addition of sodium to the diet helps to achieve the carbohydrate intake target, while raising the ceiling on water intake. This analysis provides a new perspective on nectarivory, while adding to the comparative database on nutrient regulation and emphasising water as a nutrient.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the present study, using as a model the carnivorous rainbow trout, a glucose-intolerant fish, we assessed mRNA expression levels of several genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (including ATP-citrate lyase; carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 isoforms, CPT; the mitochondrial isoform of the phosphoenolpyrutave carboxykinase, mPEPCK and pyruvate kinase, PK) and glucosensing (glucose transporter type 2, Glut2; glucokinase, GK and the potassium channel, KATP) in Brockmann bodies. We evaluated the response of these parameters to changes in feeding status (food deprived vs. fed fish) as well as to changes in the amount of carbohydrate (dextrin) in the diet. A general inhibition of the glycolytic (including the glucosensing marker GK) and β-oxidation pathways was found when comparing fed versus food-deprived fish. When comparing fish feeding on either low- or high-carbohydrate diets, we found that some genes related to lipid metabolism were more controlled by the feeding status than by the carbohydrate content (fatty acid synthase, CPTs). Findings are discussed in the context of pancreatic regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in fish, and show that while trout pancreatic metabolism can partially adapt to a high-carbohydrate diet, some of the molecular actors studied seem to be poorly regulated (KATP) and may contribute to the glucose intolerance observed in this species when fed high-carbohydrate diets.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Our study examined detection mechanisms for components of defensive ink of sea hares, Aplysia californica, by predatory sea catfish, Ariopsis felis. Behavioral analyses show aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin are detected intra-orally and by barbels and are deterrent at concentrations as low as 0.1% full strength. We performed electrophysiological recordings from the facial–trigeminal nerve complex innervating the maxillary barbel and tested aplysioviolin, phycoerythrobilin, amino acids, and bile salts in cross-adaptation experiments. Amino acids and bile salts are known stimulatory compounds for teleost taste systems. Our results show aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin are equally stimulatory and completely cross-adapt to each other’s responses. Adaptation to aplysioviolin or phycoerythrobilin reduced but did not eliminate responses to amino acids or bile salts. Adaptation to amino acids or bile salts incompletely reduced responses to aplysioviolin or phycoerythrobilin. The fact that cross-adaptations with aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin were not completely reciprocal indicates there are amino acid and bile salt sensitive fibers insensitive to aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin. These results indicate two gustatory pathways for aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin: one independent of amino acids and bile salts and another shared with some amino acids.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here we show that nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 in the hypothalamus is rapidly stimulated by leptin to a greater extent in hamsters held in short-day length (SD) as compared to long-day length (LD). Intriguingly, effects of leptin on STAT3 appeared to be in part limited to nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 associated with the cell surface rather than phosphorylation of STAT3. The number of phospho-ERK cells within the hypothalamus was unaffected by either photoperiod or leptin. However, proximal to ERK phosphorylation, hypothalamic SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) and the small growth factor receptor-binding protein (GRB2), which act as competitive negative modulators on binding of SOCS3 to leptin receptor (LRb)-associated Tyr985, were increased in SD compared to LD. Our findings suggest that activation of STAT3 by leptin may be dependent on interaction of stimulatory SHP2/GRB2 as well as inhibitory SOCS3 on the level of competitive binding to LRb-associated Tyr985. This hypothetical mechanism may represent the molecular identity of seasonally induced adjustments in leptin sensitivity and may be applied to investigating leptin sensitivity in other rodent models.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We probed the representation of underwater particle motion throughout the tadpole’s dorsal medulla to determine its spatial extent over larval life. Using neurobiotin-filled micropipettes, we recorded neural activity to z-axis particle motion (frequencies of 40–200 Hz) in the medial vestibular nucleus, lateral vestibular nucleus, dorsal medullary nucleus (DMN), and along the dorsal arcuate pathway. Sensitivity was comparable in the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei, with estimated thresholds between 0.016 and 12.5 μm displacement. Neither best responding frequency nor estimated threshold varied significantly over larval stage. Transport of neurobiotin from active recording sites was also stable over development. The DMN responded poorly to z-axis particle motion, but did respond to low-frequency pressure stimulation. These data suggest that particle motion is represented widely and stably in the tadpole’s vestibular medulla. This is in marked contrast to the representation of pressure stimulation in the auditory midbrain, where a transient “deaf period” of non-responsiveness and decreased connectivity occurs immediately prior to metamorphic climax. We suggest that, in bullfrogs, sensitivity to particle motion and to pressure follows different developmental trajectories.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested the hypothesis that hypertrophic growth in the white muscle of fishes was associated with increases in the mean DNA content of nuclei, which may be a strategy to offset increasing diffusion constraints. DAPI-stained chicken erythrocytes standards and image analysis were used to estimate nuclear DNA content in erythrocytes and muscle fibers from 17 fish species. Mean diploid (2C) values in fish erythrocytes ranged from 0.78 to 7.2 pg. Erythrocyte 2C values were used to determine ploidy level in muscle tissue of small and large size classes of each species. Within each species, mean muscle fiber diameter was greater in the large size class than the small size class, and MND was significantly greater in larger fibers for 11 of the 17 species. Nuclear DNA content per species in muscle ranged from 2 to 64C. Fiber-size dependent increases in ploidy were observed in nine species, which is consistent with our hypothesis and indicates that endoreduplication is occurring during fiber growth. However, two species exhibited significantly lower ploidy in the larger size class, and the mechanistic basis and potential advantage of this ploidy shift is unclear. These results suggest that increases in ploidy may be a common mechanism to compensate for increases in MND associated with fiber hypertrophy in fishes, although it is likely that other factors also affect ploidy changes that occur in muscle during animal growth.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study aimed to clone and sequence the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter (nkcc) from the gills of A. testudineus, and to determine the effects of seawater acclimation or exposure to 100 mmol l−1 NH4Cl in freshwater on its branchial mRNA expression. The complete coding cDNA sequence of nkcc from the gills of A. testudineus consisted of 3,495 bp, which was translated into a protein with 1,165 amino acid residues and an estimated molecular mass of 127.4 kDa. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the translated Nkcc of A. testudineus was closer to fish Nkcc1a than to fish Nkcc1b or Nkcc2. After a progressive increase in salinity, there were significant increases in the mRNA expression and protein abundance of nkcc1a in the gills of fish acclimated to seawater as compared with that of the freshwater control. Hence, it can be concluded that similar to marine teleosts, Cl− excretion through basolateral Nkcc1 of mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) was essential to seawater acclimation in A. testudineus. Exposure of A. testudineus to 100 mmol l−1 NH4Cl for 1 or 6 days also resulted in significant increases in the mRNA expression of nkcc1a in the gills, indicating a functional role of Nkcc1a in active ammonia excretion. It is probable that NH4+ enter MRCs through basolateral Nkcc1a before being actively transported across the apical membrane. Since the operation of Nkcc1a would lead to an increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration, it can be deduced that an upregulation of basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (Nka) activity would be necessary to compensate for the increased influx of Na+ into MRCs during active NH4+ excretion. This would imply that the main function of Nka in active NH4+ excretion is to maintain intracellular Na+ and K+ homeostasis instead of transporting NH4+ directly into MRCs as proposed previously. In conclusion, active salt secretion during seawater acclimation and active NH4+ excretion during exposure to ammonia in freshwater could involve similar transport mechanisms in the gills of A. testudineus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study analyzed the properties of two leech motoneurons: the excitors of dorsal longitudinal muscles (DE-3) and of dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles (MN-L) in basal conditions (normal and high Mg2+ saline) and during crawling. The voltage–current relationships in DE-3 and MN-L were similar. The curves exhibited the largest slope around resting potential, showed marked inward and outward rectification, and were not affected by high Mg2+. In response to 5-s pulses, DE-3 exhibited a fast initial adaptation, a slow recovery and a very slow late adaptation. High Mg2+ abolished the initial high frequency. The frequency–voltage relationship for the rest of the response was highly similar in normal and in high Mg2+ saline. MN-L exhibited a minor initial adaptation and then fired steadily. High Mg2+ diminished the frequency–voltage relationship. During crawling DE-3 and MN-L fired in phase and their frequency–voltage curves overlapped with the lower end of the curves obtained in basal conditions. The results suggest that the activity of these motoneurons during crawling was regulated, to a large extent, by synaptic inputs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Dietary specialisations include the loss of teeth, a modified gut with a high rate of passage, exceptionally low minimum nitrogen requirements, an apparently high basal metabolic rate and a permanently polyuric kidney. In contrast, its reproductive physiology is plesiomorphic, combining aspects such as a post-partum oestrus, embryonic diapause, photoperiodicity and extended maternal care that are usually separate characteristics of other marsupial groups. In common with a number of other marsupials, the honey possum has the potential for trichromatic colour vision and has been the subject of several studies attempting to correlate visual quality with ecological realities. Field physiological studies have established its high rates of nectar and pollen intake needed to maintain energy balance and highlight the need for a constant intake from floral sources. Early allometric studies suggesting that the honey possum’s relatively low reproductive rate may be linked to a diet limited in protein have not been supported and nitrogen intakes in the field exceed by a factor of 10 the animal’s basic requirements for balance. Measurements of rates of protein turnover in field-caught lactating females suggest that they divert nitrogen from the protein pool to milk production by reducing rates of degradation, rather than by increasing rates of synthesis of protein. Although not yet an endangered species, the honey possum’s habitat has been drastically reduced since European occupation of Australia and future-targeted research on the animal’s unique physiology and habitat linkage is needed that can be translated into effective management practices.

It was reported that neurons located in an outer layer of ALs showed γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-like immunoreactivity more strongly than centrally located neurons, which were surrounded by the GAD-immunoreactive terminals. We investigated effects of GABA on the electrical activity of AL neurons. About 50% of embryonic AL neurons exhibited spontaneous firing. In the on-cell recording, GABA, muscimol, and GABA in combination with CGP35348 inhibited this firing. In whole-cell voltage clamp recordings, GABA and muscimol evoked a transient current. The mean reversal potential of GABA-evoked currents was close to the theoretical reversal potential of Cl−. These results indicate that GABA exerts the inhibitory effect on the firing through the activation of GABAA receptors. In addition, the intracellular concentration of Cl− was estimated to be about 16 mM in measurements with the gramicidin-perforated configuration, indicating the physiological reversal potential of the GABA current was about −60 mV. In conclusion, AL neurons have an intrinsic mechanism to evoke the spontaneous firing, which can be arrested by the inhibitory mechanism through the activation of the GABAA receptors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Foraging in ants is often a pheromonally mediated collective action performed by mature workers; age-dependent differences in olfactory response thresholds may therefore proximately regulate task repertoire development. In the ant Pheidole dentata, foraging activity increases with chronological age in minor workers, and is chemically controlled. The onset of foraging in minor workers is accompanied by marked neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes, including synaptic remodeling in olfactory regions of the brain, proliferation of serotonergic neurons, and increased brain titers of monoamines, notably serotonin. We examined the linkage of serotonin and olfactory responsiveness by assaying trail-following performance in mature P. dentata minor workers with normal serotonin levels, or serotonin levels experimentally lowered by oral administration of the serotonin synthesis inhibitor α-methyltryptophan (AMTP). By assessing responsiveness to standardized pheromone trails, we demonstrate that trail-following behaviors are significantly reduced in serotonin-depleted workers. AMTP-treated individuals were less likely to initiate trail following, and oriented along pheromone trails for significantly shorter distances than untreated, similar-age workers. These results demonstrate for the first time that serotonin modulates olfactory processes and/or motor functions associated with cooperative foraging in ants.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We used temperature-sensitive radio transmitters to measure patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in wild Natterer’s bats Myotis nattereri during hibernation. Duration of torpor bouts ranged from 0.06 to 20.4 days with individual means ranging from 0.9 to 8.9 days. Arousals from torpor occurred most commonly coincident with the time (relative to sunset) typical for bats emerging from summer roosts to forage. Bats with lower body condition indices had a shorter average duration of their torpor bouts. We found a non-linear relationship between duration of torpor bout and ambient temperature: the longest average torpor bouts were at temperatures between 2 and 4°C with shorter bouts at lower and higher ambient temperatures. One individual was radio-tracked for ten nights, remained active for an average of 297 min each night and was active for longer on warmer nights. Our results suggest that vespertilionid bats use relatively short torpor bouts during hibernation in a location with a maritime climate. We hypothesise that Natterer’s bats time arousals to maximise opportunities for potential foraging during winter although winter feeding is not the sole determinant of arousal as bats still arouse at times when foraging is unlikely.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, synchrony is not perfect and distinct leader and follower roles are often maintained. In entrainment experiments in which conspecific signals were presented at various rates, chirps displayed as follower showed notable signal plasticity. Follower chirps were shortened by reducing the number and duration of syllables, especially those of low and medium amplitude. The degree of shortening depended on the time delay between leader and follower signals and the sound level of the entraining stimulus. The same signal plasticity was evident in male duets, with the effect that the last syllables of highest amplitude overlapped more strongly. Respiratory measurements showed that solo singing males producing higher chirp rates suffered from higher metabolic costs compared to males singing at lower rates. In contrast, respiratory rate was rather constant during a synchronous entrainment to a conspecific signal repeated at various rates. This allowed males to maintain a steady duty cycle, associated with a constant metabolic rate. Results are discussed with respect to the preference for leader signals in females and the possible benefits males may gain by overlapping their follower signals in a chorus.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Puerto Rican Anolis lizards have diverged into multiple photic niches, making them a good model for non-visual photosensory ecology. We investigated the photic induction of locomotor activity, a non-visual response to light, in four species of Anolis comprising two pairs of closely related, ecomorphologically similar species whose microhabitats differ in solar irradiance. We developed a device for continuous, automated detection and recording of anole locomotor activity, and used it to characterize activity under 12:12 h light–dark cycles. Next, we administered a series of 2-h light pulses during the dark period of the light–dark cycle and measured the increase in locomotor activity relative to baseline dark activity. Five different irradiances (ranging from very dim to daytime levels) were given to each individual lizard on separate nights. As expected, light caused an irradiance-dependent increase in locomotor activity in all four species. The responses at the highest irradiances were significantly greater in species occupying relatively more shaded habitats, suggesting that non-visual photoreception may be adapted to habitat light in Anolis lizards.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

For stimuli with a modulation depth of 100% the critical gap duration was 6–8 ms. A reduction of the modulation depth of gaps to 50% led either to an increase or a decrease of the critical gap duration. In the latter case, the critical gap duration dropped to 3–4 ms indicating a higher sensitivity of auditory processing. The response curve for variation of pulse period was not limited by temporal resolution. However, the reduced response to stimuli with a high duty cycle, and thus short pause durations, was in accordance with the limits of temporal resolution. The critical duration of masking pulses inserted into pauses was 4–6 ms. An analysis of the songs of males revealed that gaps (5.8 ms) and masking pulses (6.9 ms) were at detectable time scales for the auditory pathway of female crickets.

Here, we studied elemental and configural mixture coding in olfactory neurons of the honeybee antennal lobe, local neurons in particular. We conducted intracellular recordings and stimulated with monomolecular odorants and their coherent or incoherent binary mixtures to reproduce a temporally dynamic environment. We found that about half of the neurons responded as ‘elemental neurons’, i.e. responses evoked by mixtures reflected the underlying feature information from one of the components. The other half responded as ‘configural neurons’, i.e. responses to mixtures were clearly different from responses to their single components. Elemental neurons divided in late responders (above 60 ms) and early responder neurons (below 60 ms), whereas responses of configural coding neurons concentrated in-between these divisions.

Several species of hibernator completely cease food intake (aphagia) for nearly 7 months regardless of ambient temperature and in many cases, whether or not food is available to them. Food intake regulation has been studied in mammals that hibernate for over 50 years and still little is known about the physiological mechanisms that control this important behavior in hibernators. It is well known from lesion experiments in non-hibernators that the hypothalamus is the main brain region controlling food intake and therefore body mass. In hibernators, the regulation of food intake and body mass is presumably governed by a circannual rhythm since there is a clear seasonal rhythm to food intake: animals increase food intake in the summer and early autumn, food intake declines in autumn and actually ceases in winter in many species, and resumes again in spring as food becomes available in the environment. Changes in circulating hormones (e.g., leptin, insulin, and ghrelin), nutrients (glucose, and free fatty acids), and cellular enzymes such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) have been shown to determine the activity of neurons involved in the food intake pathway. Thus, it appears likely that the food intake pathway is controlled by a variety of inputs, but is also acted upon by upstream regulators that are presumably rhythmic in nature. Current research examining the molecular mechanisms and integration of environmental signals (e.g., temperature and light) with these molecular mechanisms will hopefully shed light on how animals can turn off food intake and survive without eating for months on end.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The medial frontal cortex indirectly controls vocalizations, based on the recognition of social context. We examined whether the medial frontal cortex was responsible for antiphonal vocalization, or turn-taking, in naked mole-rats. In normal turn-taking, naked mole-rats vocalize more frequently to dominant individuals than to subordinate ones. Bilateral lesions of the medial frontal cortex disrupted differentiation of call rates to the stimulus animals, which had varied social relationships to the subject. However, medial frontal cortex lesions did not affect either the acoustic properties of the vocalizations or the timing of the vocal exchanges. This suggests that the medial frontal cortex may be involved in social cognition or decision making during turn-taking, while other regions of the brain regulate when animals vocalize and the vocalizations themselves.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The present study investigated GDH from tail muscle of the freshwater crayfish Orconectes virilis exploring changes to kinetic properties, phosphorylation levels and structural stability between two forms of the enzyme (aerobic control and 20-h severe hypoxic). Evidence indicated that GDH was converted to a high phosphate form under oxygen limitation. ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining showed a 42% higher bound phosphate content on GDH from muscle of severely hypoxic crayfish compared with the aerobic form, and treatment of this GDH with commercial phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase), and treatments that stimulated the activities of different endogenous protein phosphatases (stimulating PP1 + PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) yielded significant increases in the fold activation by ADP of GDH from both control and severe hypoxic conditions. By contrast, stimulation of the activities of endogenous protein kinases (AMPK, PKA or CaMK) significantly reduced the ADP fold activation from control animals. The physiological consequence of severe hypoxia-induced GDH phosphorylation may be to suppress GDH activity under low oxygen, shutting off this critical bridge point between two metabolic pathways.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although this stress-induced rise in Tb has been extensively studied on model organisms under controlled environments, individual variation in this interesting phenomenon has not been examined in the field. We investigated the stress-induced rise in Tb in free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) to determine first if it is repeatable. We predicted that the stress-induced rise in Tb should be positively correlated to factors affecting heat production and heat dissipation, including ambient temperature (Ta), body mass (Mb), and field metabolic rate (FMR). Over two summers, we recorded both Tb within the first minute of handling time (Tb1) and after 5 min of handling time (Tb5) 294 times on 140 individuals. The mean ∆Tb (Tb5 – Tb1) during this short interval was 0.30 ± 0.02°C, confirming that the stress-induced rise in Tb occurs in chipmunks. Consistent differences among individuals accounted for 40% of the total variation in ∆Tb (i.e. the stress-induced rise in Tb is significantly repeatable). We also found that the stress-induced rise in Tb was positively correlated to Ta, Mb, and mass-adjusted FMR. These results confirm that individuals consistently differ in their expression of the stress-induced rise in Tb and that the extent of its expression is affected by factors related to heat production and dissipation.

Preparations of the posterior tentacle (including sensory pad, tentacular ganglion and olfactory nerve) or central ganglia with attached posterior tentacles were exposed to cineole odorant and the evoked responses were affected by prior application of 5HT or DA or their precursors 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) and l-DOPA, respectively. 5HT applications decreased cineole-evoked responses recorded in the olfactory nerve and hyperpolarized the identified tentacle retractor muscle motoneuron MtC3, while DA applications led to the opposite changes. 5HTP and l-DOPA modified MtC3 activity comparable to 5HT and DA action. DA was also found to decrease the amplitude of spontaneous local field potential oscillations in the procerebrum, a central olfactory structure. In vivo studies demonstrated that injection of 5HTP in freely moving snails reduced the tentacle withdrawal response to aversive ethyl acetate odorant, whereas the injection of l-DOPA increased responses to “neutral” cineole and aversive ethyl acetate odorants.

The long and narrow wings of molossids are considered energetically adapted to fast flight between resource patches, but less suited for manoeuvring in more confined spaces, such as between tree-tops or in forest gaps. To understand whether a potential increase in metabolic costs of manoeuvring excludes molossids from foraging in more confined spaces, we measured energy costs and speed of manoeuvring flight in two tropical molossids, 18 g Molossuscurrentium and 23 g Molossussinaloae, when flying in a ~500 m3 hexagonal enclosure (~120 m2 area), which is of similar dimensions as typical forest gaps. Flight metabolism averaged 10.21 ± 3.00 and 11.32 ± 3.54 ml CO2 min−1, and flight speeds 5.65 ± 0.47 and 6.27 ± 0.68 m s−1 for M. currentium and M. sinaloae respectively. Metabolic rate during flight was higher for the M. currentium than for the similar-sized, but broader-winged frugivore Carolliasowelli, corroborating that broad-winged bats are better adapted to flying in confined spaces. These higher metabolic costs of manoeuvring flight may be caused by having to fly slower than the optimal foraging speed, and by the additional metabolic costs for centripetal acceleration in curves. This may preclude molossids from foraging efficiently between canopy trees or in forest gaps. The surprisingly brief burst of foraging activity at dusk of many molossids might be related to the cooling of the air column after sunset, which drives airborne insects to lower strata. Accordingly, foraging activity of molossids may quickly turn unprofitable when the abundance of insects decreases above the canopy.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In cryptodires (e.g., white-lipped mud turtle Kinosternon leucostomum) aquatic respiration is via buccal or cutaneous routes whereas in pleurodires (e.g., Fitzroy River turtle Rheodytes leukops), it is achieved primarily via specialized cloacal bursae. This study records the voluntary diving performance of the western sawshelled turtle Myuchelys bellii in Bald Rock Creek from the temperate zone of the Murray–Darling Basin of Australia. Myuchelys bellii has a moderately specialized cloacal bursae morphology compared to other pleurodiran turtles and displays impressive dive durations spanning more than 15 days during the winter months. This is attributed to its ability to maintain aerobic dives via its cloacal bursae and low water temperatures in winter. Myuchelys bellii seasonal and diel diving performance, including its crepuscular habit, is comparable to R. leukops and Elseya albagula.

The complete coding cDNA sequence of cpsIII from the liver of P. annectens consisted of 4530 bp, which coded for 1,510 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 166.1 kDa. The Cps III of P. annectens consisted of a mitochondrial targeting sequence of 44 amino acid residues, a GAT domain spanning from tyrosine 45 to isoleucine 414, and a methylglyoxal synthase-like domain spanning from valine 433 to arginine 1513. Two cysteine residues (cysteine 1337 and cysteine 1347) that are characteristic of N-acetylglutamate dependency were also present. The critical Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad (cysteine 301, histidine 385 and glutamate 387) together with methionine 302 and glutamine 305 affirmed that P. annectens expressed Cps III and not Cps I. A comparison of the translated amino acid sequence of Cps III from P. annectens with CPS sequences from other animals revealed that it shared the highest similarity with elasmobranch Cps III. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that P. annectens CPS III could have evolved from Cps III of elasmobranchs. Indeed, Cps III from P. annectens used mainly glutamine as the substrate, and its activity decreased significantly when glutamine and ammonia were included together in the assay system. There were significant increases (9- to 12-fold) in the mRNA expression of cps III in the liver of fish during the induction phase (days 3 and 6) of aestivation in air. Aestivation in hypoxia or in mud had a delayed effect on the increase in the mRNA expression of cps III, which extended beyond the induction phase of aestivation, reiterating the importance of differentiating effects that are intrinsic to aestivation from those intrinsic to hypoxia. Furthermore, results from this study confirmed that environmental ammonia exposure led to a significant increase in the mRNA expression of cps III in the liver of P. annectens, alluding to the important functional role of urea not only as a product of ammonia detoxification but also as a putative internal cue for aestivation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Cold acclimatization is generally associated with an increase in physiological maintenance costs, measured as basal metabolic rate (BMR), and cold endurance, reflected by summit metabolic rate (Msum). However, several northern species also form social groups in winter and a bird’s hierarchical position may influence the size of its metabolically active organs as well as its BMR. Winter metabolic performance in these species may therefore reflect a complex set of adjustments to both seasonal climatic variations and social environment. We studied the effect of social status on parameters of cold acclimatization (body mass, size of fat reserves and pectoral muscles, BMR and Msum) in free-living black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). Birds that were structurally large and heavy for their body size, mostly dominant individuals, carried more fat reserves and had larger pectoral muscles. However, social status had little effect on metabolic performance in the cold. Indeed, Msum was independent of social rank while mass-corrected BMR was slightly lower in dominant individuals, likely due to a statistical dilution effect caused by large metabolically inactive fat reserves. BMR and Msum, whether considered in terms of whole-animal values, corrected for body mass or body size were nevertheless correlated, suggesting a functional link between these metabolic components. Our results therefore indicate that the energy cost of social dominance is not a generalized phenomenon in small wintering birds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In many species, dedicated brain regions initiate and maintain behavior and set the duration and frequency of the locomotor episode. In the leech, removing the entire head brain enhances swimming, but the individual roles of its components, the supra- and subesophageal ganglia, in the control of locomotion are unknown. Here we describe the influence of these two structures and that of the tail brain on rhythmic swimming in isolated nerve cord preparations and in nearly intact leeches suspended in an aqueous, “swim-enhancing” environment. We found that, in isolated preparations, swim episode duration and swim burst frequency are greatly increased when the supraesophageal ganglion is removed, but the subesophageal ganglion is intact. The prolonged swim durations observed with the anterior-most ganglion removed were abolished by removal of the tail ganglion. Experiments on the nearly intact leeches show that, in these preparations, the subesophageal ganglion acts to decrease cycle period but, unexpectedly, also decreases swim duration. These results suggest that the supraesophageal ganglion is the primary structure that constrains leech swimming; however, the control of swim duration in the leech is complex, especially in the intact animal.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In larval animals, reducing excitability by incubating in tetrodotoxin or the glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX or CNQX/AP5 for 20–48 h resulted in a diverse set of cellular and synaptic changes that together were consistent with an increase in spinal cord excitability. Similar changes occurred to a tonic increase in excitation evoked by incubating in high potassium physiological solution (i.e. responses were unidirectional). We also examined developmental influences on these effects. In animals developing from the larval to adult form effects were reduced or absent, suggesting that at this stage the spinal cord was more tolerant of changes in activity levels. Responses had returned in adult animals, but they were now bi-directional (i.e. opposite effects were evoked by an increase or decrease in excitability). The spinal cord can thus monitor and adapt cellular and synaptic properties to tonic changes in excitability levels.

Relatively few species of teleost fish can tolerate salinities much above 50 ppt, because of the challenges to osmoregulation, but those that do, usually estuarine, euryhaline species, show a strong ability to osmoregulate in salinities well over 100 ppt. Typically, plasma Na+ and Cl− concentrations rise slowly or not at all up to about 65 ppt. At higher salinities ion levels do rise, but the increase is small relative to the magnitude of increase in concentrations of the surrounding water. A number of adjustments are responsible for such strong osmoregulation. Reduced branchial water permeability is indicated by the observation that with the exposure to hyper-salinities drinking rates rise more slowly than the branchial osmotic gradient. Lower water permeability limits osmotic water loss and greatly reduces the salt load incurred in replacing it. Still, increased gut Na+/K+-ATPase (NAK) activity is necessary to absorb the larger gut salt load and increased HCO3− secretion is required to precipitate Ca2+ and some Mg2+ in the imbibed water to facilitate water absorption. All Na+ and Cl− taken up must be excreted and increased branchial salt excreting capacity is indicated by elevated mitochondrion-rich cell density and size, gill NAK activity and expression of chloride channels. Excretion of Na+ and Cl− occurs against a larger gradient than in seawater and calculation of the equilibrium potential for Na+ across the gill epithelium indicates that the trans-epithelial potential required for excretion of Na+ climbs with salinity up to about 65 ppt before leveling off due to the increasing plasma Na+ levels. During acute transition to SW or mildly hyper-saline waters, some species have shown the ability to upregulate branchial NAK activity rapidly and this may play an important role in limiting disturbances at higher salinities. It does not appear that the opercular epithelium, which in SW acts in a way that is functionally similar to the gills, continues to do so in hyper-saline waters. Little is know about the hormones involved in acclimation to hyper-salinity, but the few studies available suggest a role for cortisol, but not growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor. Despite the increased transport capacity evident in both the gill and gut in hyper-saline waters there is no clear trend toward increased metabolic rate. These studies provide a general outline of the mechanisms of osmoregulation in these species, but significant questions still remain.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, the effects of thermal- and hypoxia-mediated gill remodeling on branchial Na+ fluxes and the distribution of putative Na+-transporting ionocytes in goldfish were assessed. When assessed either in vitro (isolated gill arches) or in vivo at a common water temperature, the presence of an interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) in fish acclimated to 7°C clearly decreased Na+ efflux across the gill relative to fish maintained at 25°C and lacking an ILCM. However, loss of the ILCM in 7°C-acclimated fish exposed to hypoxia led to a decrease in Na+ efflux (assessed under hypoxic conditions) despite the apparent large increases in functional lamellar surface area. Goldfish possessing an ILCM were able to sustain Na+ uptake, albeit at a lower rate matched to efflux, owing to the re-distribution of ionocytes expressing genes thought to be involved in Na+ uptake [Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and V- type H+-ATPase] to the edge of the ILCM where they can establish contact with the surrounding environment. NHE-expressing cells co-localized with Na+/K+-ATPase expression, suggesting a role for NHE in Na+-uptake in the goldfish. Implications of the ILCM on ion fluxes in the goldfish are discussed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Survival of small eutherian species in cold environments is crucially dependent on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated, adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis that is executed in brown adipose tissue. In a small dasyurid marsupial species, the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), an orthologue of UCP1 has been recently identified which is upregulated during cold exposure resembling adaptive molecular adjustments of eutherian brown adipose tissue. Here, we tested for a thermogenic function of marsupial brown adipose tissue and UCP1 by evaluating the capacity of nonshivering thermogenesis in cold-acclimated dunnarts. In response to an optimal dosage of noradrenaline, cold-acclimated dunnarts (12°C) showed no additional recruitment of noradrenaline-induced maximal thermogenic capacity in comparison to warm-acclimated dunnarts (24°C). While no differences in body temperature were observed between the acclimation groups, basal metabolic rate was significantly elevated after cold acclimation. Therefore, we suggest that adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis does not occur in this marsupial species despite the cold recruitment of oxidative capacity and UCP1 in the interscapular fat deposit. In conclusion, the ancient UCP orthologue in marsupials does not contribute to the classical nonshivering thermogenesis, and may exhibit a different physiological role.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Comparison of body temperature and activity of free-living Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) and the smaller Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica) in the Saudi desert,"Heterothermy, a variability in body temperature beyond the normal limits of homeothermy, is widely viewed as a key adaptation of arid-adapted ungulates. However, desert ungulates with a small body mass, i.e. a relatively large surface area-to-volume ratio and a small thermal inertia, are theoretically less likely to employ adaptive heterothermy than are larger ungulates. We measured body temperature and activity patterns, using implanted data loggers, in free-ranging Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx, ±70 kg) and the smaller Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica, ±15 kg) inhabiting the same Arabian desert environment, at the same time. Compared to oryx, sand gazelle had higher mean daily body temperatures (F1,6 = 47.3, P = 0.0005), higher minimum daily body temperatures (F1,6 = 42.6, P = 0.0006) and higher maximum daily body temperatures (F1,6 = 11.0, P = 0.02). Despite these differences, both species responded similarly to changes in environmental conditions. As predicted for adaptive heterothermy, maximum daily body temperature increased (F1,6 = 84.0, P < 0.0001), minimum daily body temperature decreased (F1,6 = 92.2, P < 0.0001), and daily body temperature amplitude increased (F1,6 = 97.6, P < 0.0001) as conditions got progressively hotter and drier. There were no species differences in activity levels, however, both gazelle and oryx showed a biphasic or crepuscular rhythm during the warm wet season but shifted to a more nocturnal rhythm during the hot dry season. Activity was attenuated during the heat of the day at times when both species selected cool microclimates. These two species of Arabian ungulates employ heterothermy, cathemerality and shade seeking very similarly to survive the extreme, arid conditions of Arabian deserts, despite their size difference.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Because a marine mammal’s proficiency at exploiting underwater prey resources is based on the ability to store large amounts of oxygen (O2) and to utilize these reserves efficiently, this study was designed to determine if NFS pups had lower blood, muscle, and total body O2 stores than adults. Pups (<1-month old) had a calculated aerobic dive limit only ~40% of adult females due to lower blood and, to a much greater extent, muscle O2 stores. Development of the Pectoralis (Pec) and Longissimus dorsi (LD) skeletal muscles was further examined by determining their myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition and enzyme activities. In all animals, the slow MHC I and fast-twitch IIA proteins typical of oxidative fiber types were dominant, but adult muscles contained more (Pec ~50%; LD ~250% higher) fast-twitch MHC IID/X protein characteristic of glycolytic muscle fibers, than pup muscles. This suggests that adults have greater ability to generate muscle power rapidly and/or under anaerobic conditions. Pup muscles also had lower aerobic and anaerobic ATP production potential, as indicated by lower metabolically scaled citrate synthase, β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities (all P values ≤0.001). In combination, these findings indicate that pups are biochemically and physiologically limited in their diving capabilities relative to adults.

Budgerigars are strictly diurnal while Bourke’s parrots are active in dim twilight. Earlier studies show that the intensity threshold of colour vision is similar in both species while Bourke’s parrots have larger eyes with a higher density of rods than budgerigars. In this study, we investigate whether this could be an adaptation for better spatial vision in dim light. We used two alternative forced-choice experiments to determine the spatial acuity of both species at light intensities ranging from 0.08 to 73 cd/m2. We also determined the spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF) for bright light in Bourke’s parrots and compare it to existing data for budgerigars. The spatial acuity of Bourke’s parrots was found to be similar to that of budgerigars at all light levels. Also the CSF of Bourke’s parrots is similar to that of budgerigars with a sensitivity peak located between 2.1 and 2.6 cycles/degree.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to measure the relative mRNA expression of three previously cloned and sequenced transporters [H+–K+-ATPase (HKA), Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC), and the Rhesus glycoprotein (Rhbg1; an ammonia transporter)] over a 24-h time course following feeding. Plasma total ammonia increased about threefold from pre-feeding levels to 288 μmol l−1, whereas total ammonia levels in chyme supernatant reached a sixfold higher value (1.8 mmol l−1) than plasma levels. Feeding did not appear to have a statistically significant effect on the relative mRNA expression of the gastric HKA or Rhbg1. However, the relative mRNA expression of gastric NBC was increased 24 h following the ingestion of a meal. Along the intestinal tract, feeding increased the relative mRNA expression of Rhbg1, but had no effect on the expression of NBC. Expression of the gastric HKA was undetectable in the intestinal tract of freshwater rainbow trout. Digestion increased the activity of glutamine synthetase in the posterior intestine at 12 and 24 h following feeding.

Acid–base balance is maintained by the matched excretion of acid equivalents via other routes, presumably the gill and/or kidney. The goal of the present study was to examine acid–base balance in rainbow trout upon transfer to more dilute environments, conditions under which base excretion into the intestine is predicted to fall, requiring compensatory adjustments of acid excretion at the gill and/or kidney if acid–base balance is to be maintained. Net acid excretion via the gill/kidney and rectal fluid, and blood acid–base status were monitored in seawater-acclimated rainbow trout maintained in seawater or transferred to iso-osmotic conditions. As predicted, transfer to iso-osmotic conditions significantly reduced base excretion into the rectal fluid (by ~48%). Transfer to iso-osmotic conditions also significantly reduced the excretion of titratable acidity via extra-intestinal routes from 183.4 ± 71.3 to −217.5 ± 42.7 μmol kg−1 h−1 (N = 7). At the same time, however, ammonia excretion increased significantly during iso-osmotic transfer (by ~72%) so that the apparent overall reduction in net acid excretion (from 419.7 ± 92.9 to 189.2 ± 76.5 μmol kg−1 h−1; N = 7) was not significant. Trout maintained blood acid–base status during iso-osmotic transfer, although arterial pH was significantly higher in transferred fish than in those maintained in seawater. To explore the mechanisms underlying these adjustments of acid–base regulation, the relative mRNA expression and where possible, activity of a suite of proteins involved in acid–base balance were examined in intestine, gill and kidney. At the kidney, reduced mRNA expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA; cytosolic and membrane-associated CA IV), V-type H+-ATPase, and Na+/HCO3− co-transporter were consistent with a reduced role in net acid excretion following iso-osmotic transfer. Changes in relative mRNA expression and/or activity at the intestine and gill were consistent with the roles of these organs in osmotic rather than acid–base regulation. Overall, the data emphasize the coordination of acid–base, osmoregulatory and ionoregulatory processes that occur with salinity transfer in a euryhaline fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, temporal resolution of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) was measured using two auditory evoked potential (AEP)-based methods: auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to paired clicks and envelope following responses (EFRs) to amplitude-modulated tones. The basic patterns observed in cowbirds were similar to those found in other songbird species, suggesting similar temporal processing capabilities. The amplitude of the ABR to the second click was less than that of the first click at inter-click intervals less than 10 ms, and decreased to 30% at an interval of 1 ms. EFR amplitude was generally greatest at modulation frequencies from 335 to 635 Hz and decreased at higher and lower modulation frequencies.

These vesicles were used to study the cation dependency of sugar and amino acid transport across luminal membranes of hepatopancreatic epithelial cells. 3H-d-glucose uptake by BBMV against transient sugar concentration gradients occurred when either transmembrane sodium or potassium gradients were the only driving forces for sugar accumulation, suggesting the presence of a possible coupled transport system capable of using either cation. 3H-l-histidine transport was only stimulated by a transmembrane potassium gradient, while 3H-l-leucine uptake was enhanced by either a sodium or potassium gradient. These responses suggest the possible presence of a potassium-dependent transporter that accommodates either amino acid and a sodium-dependent system restricted only to l-leucine. Uptake of 3H-l-leucine was significantly stimulated (P < 0.05) by several metallic cations (e.g., Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Cd2+, or Co2+) at external pH values of 7.0 or 5.0 (internal pH 7.0), suggesting a potential synergistic role of the cations in the transmembrane transfer of amino acids. 3H-l-histidine influxes (15 suptakes) were hyperbolic functions of external [zinc] or [manganese], following Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The apparent affinity constant (e.g., Km) for manganese was an order of magnitude smaller (Km = 0.22 μM Mn) than that for zinc (Km = 1.80 μM Zn), while no significant difference (P > 0.05) occurred between their maximal transport velocities (e.g., Jmax).

Its simple neural circuit has made this behavior a model for examining neural control of movement. The S-start, initiated with an S-shaped body bend, is a physiologically distinct escape that occurs in esocid fishes. Here we examine whether zebrafish larvae perform S-starts in order to better understand startle diversity and to attempt to identify the S-start in a system that is tractable for neurobiological studies. We found that larval zebrafish startles varied in the extent of their caudal bending, resulting in C, S and intermediate-shaped responses. We recorded two distinct motor patterns: nearly simultaneous initial activity along one side of the body, characteristic of C-starts, and nearly simultaneous activity rostrally on one side and caudally on the other, characteristic of S-starts. Head stimulation generally elicited C-starts while tail stimulation elicited C- and S-starts. These results demonstrate that the S-start is more common than previously documented and occurs in early developmental stages. We suggest that the S-start may be a fundamental escape behavior in fishes and may provide a comparative model to the C-start for understanding simple neural circuits.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Muscle tissue is the greatest proportion of body mass in most vertebrates and undergoes dramatic alterations in metabolism and associated oxygen flux.

Using locomotory performance indices, whole body respirometry, and X-ray imaging to visualize the respiratory system, we tested the hypothesis that due to the rigid exoskeleton, an increase in body mass during the intermolt period compresses the air-filled tracheal system, thereby, reducing oxygen delivery capacity in late stage insects. Specifically, we measured air sac ventilation frequency, size, and compressibility in both the abdomen and femur of early, middle, and late stage sixth instar Schistocerca americana grasshoppers. Our results show that late stage grasshoppers have a reduced air sac ventilation frequency in the femur and decreased convective capacities in the abdomen and femur. We also used X-ray images of the abdomen and femur to calculate the total proportion of tissue dedicated to respiratory structure during the intermolt period. We found that late stage grasshoppers had a lower proportion of their body dedicated to respiratory structures, especially air sacs, which convectively ventilate the tracheal system. These intermolt changes make oxygen delivery more challenging to the tissues, especially critical ones such as the jumping muscle. Indeed, late stage grasshoppers showed reduced jump frequencies compared to early stage grasshoppers, as well as decreased mass-specific CO2 emission rates at 3 kPa PO2.

Cells in the anterior DON project to the contralateral tectum, whereas cells in the posterior DON project bilaterally to the torus semicircularis and lateral mesencephalic nucleus. In this study, we investigated the properties of both populations and found that they form two physiologically different populations. Cells in the posterior DON are about one order of magnitude more sensitive and respond better to stimuli with lower frequency content than anterior cells. The posterior cells are, therefore, better suited to detect distant prey represented by low-amplitude signals at the receptors, along with a lower frequency spectrum, whereas cells in the anterior DON may only be able to sense nearby prey. This suggests the existence of two distinct channels for electrosensory information processing: one for proximal signals via the anterior DON and one for distant stimuli via the posterior DON with the sensory input fed into the appropriate ascending channels based on the relative sensitivity of both cell populations.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Because diurnal heat storage mechanisms should be favoured by large body size, we investigated whether this response also exists in Asian elephants when exposed to warm environmental conditions of their natural habitat. We compared daily cycles of intestinal Tb of 11 adult Asian elephants living under natural ambient temperatures (Ta) in Thailand (mean Ta ~ 30°C) and in 6 Asian elephants exposed to cooler conditions (mean Ta ~ 21°C) in Germany. Elephants in Thailand had mean daily ranges of Tb oscillations (1.15°C) that were significantly larger than in animals kept in Germany (0.51°C). This was due to both increased maximum Tb during the day and decreased minimum Tb at late night. Elephant’s minimum Tb lowered daily as Ta increased and hence entered the day with a thermal reserve for additional heat storage, very similar to arid-zone ungulates. We conclude that these responses show all characteristics of heterothermy, and that this thermoregulatory strategy is not restricted to desert mammals, but is also employed by Asian elephants.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Because, size influences oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production rates in mammals, this lineage likely displays an extraordinary variation in oxygen store management compared to other marine mammal groups. To examine this, we measured changes in the partial pressures of respiratory gases ($$ P_{{{\text{O}}_{2} }} $$, $$ P_{{{\text{CO}}_{2} }} $$), pH, and lactate in the blood during voluntary, quiescent, submerged breath holds in Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and a killer whale (Orcinus orca) representing a mass range of 96–3,850 kg. These measurements provided an empirical determination of the effect of body size on the variability in blood biochemistry during breath hold and experimentally determined aerobic dive limits (ADL) within one taxonomic group (odontocetes). For the species in this study, maximum voluntary breath-hold duration was positively correlated with body mass, ranging from 3.5 min in white-sided dolphins to 13.3 min for the killer whale. Variation in breath-hold duration was associated with differences in the rate of change for $$ P_{{{\text{O}}_{2} }} $$ throughout breath hold; $$ P_{{{\text{O}}_{2} }} $$ decreased twice as fast for the two smaller species (−0.6 mmHg O2 min−1) compared to the largest species (−0.3 mmHg O2 min−1).

These results demonstrate that large body size in odontocetes facilitates increased aerobic breath-hold capacity as mediated by decreased mass-specific metabolic rates (rates of change in $$ P_{{{\text{O}}_{2} }} $$ served as a proxy for oxygen utilization). Indeed the experimentally determined 5 min ADL for bottlenose dolphins was surpassed by the 13.3 min maximum breath hold of the killer whale, which did not end in a rise in lactate. Rather, breath hold ended voluntarily as respiratory gases and pH fell within a narrow range for both large and small species, likely providing cues for ventilation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In mammals, ECBs regulate feeding primarily through the CB1 receptors within the brain whereas the CB2 receptors are primarily involved in the regulation of immune function by direct action on peripheral immune cells and central glia. The central effect of ECBs on feeding behavior has not been studied in non-mammalian species. Therefore, the present study investigated the effect of CB65, a selective CB2 receptors agonist, on food intake in the neonatal chicks. In addition, the effect of astressin, a CRF receptor antagonist, on CB65-induced food intake was also investigated. Intracerebroventricular injection of the CB65 (1.25 μg) increased the food intake at 30- and 60-min post-injection significantly as compared to the control group. Pretreatment with a selective CB2 receptor antagonist, AM630, but not astressin, significantly attenuated the CB65-induced food intake. These results suggested that CB2 receptor agonists act on the brain to induce food intake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Our results demonstrated that 6 days of estivation in normoxia led to up-regulation of mRNA expressions of several genes related to urea synthesis, including carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (Cps), argininosuccinate synthetase and glutamine synthetase. They indicate that increased urea synthesis, despite being energy-intensive, is an important adaptive response of estivation. They also offer indirect support to the proposition that urea synthesis in this lungfish involved a Cps that uses glutamine as a substrate. In addition, up- or down-regulation of several gene clusters occurred in the liver of P. annectens after 6 days of estivation in normoxia. These estivation-specific genes were involved in the prevention of clot formation, activation of the lectin pathway for complement activation, conservation of minerals (e.g. iron and copper) and increased production of hemoglobin beta. Since there were up- and down-regulation of mRNA expressions of genes related to ribosomal proteins and translational elongation factors, there could be simultaneous increases in protein degradation and protein synthesis during the first 6 days (the induction phase) of estivation, confirming the importance of reconstruction of protein structures in preparation for the maintenance phase of estivation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Magadi water is extremely alkaline (pH = 9.92) and otherwise unusual: titratable alkalinity (290 mequiv L−1, i.e. HCO3− and CO32−) rather than Cl− (112 mmol L−1) represents the major anion matching Na+ = 356 mmol L−1, with very low concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (<1 mmol L−1). Immediately after fish capture, TEP was +4 mV (inside positive), but stabilized at +7 mV at 10–30 h post-capture when experiments were performed in Magadi water. Transfer to 250% Magadi water increased the TEP to +9.5 mV, and transfer to fresh water and deionized water decreased the TEP to −13 and −28 mV, respectively, effects which were not due to changes in pH or osmolality. The very negative TEP in deionized water was attenuated in a linear fashion by log elevations in [Ca2+]. Extreme cold (1 vs. 28°C) reduced the positive TEP in Magadi water by 60%, suggesting blockade of an electrogenic component, but did not alter the negative TEP in dilute solution. When fish were transferred to 350 mmol L−1 solutions of NaHCO3, NaCl, NaNO3, or choline Cl, only the 350 mmol L−1 NaHCO3 solution sustained the TEP unchanged at +7 mV; in all others, the TEP fell. Furthermore, after transfer to 50, 10, and 2% dilutions of 350 mmol L−1 NaHCO3, the TEPs remained identical to those in comparable dilutions of Magadi water, whereas this did not occur with comparable dilutions of 350 mmol L−1 NaCl—i.e. the fish behaves electrically as if living in an NaHCO3 solution equimolar to Magadi water. We conclude that the TEP is largely a Na+ diffusion potential attenuated by some permeability to anions. In Magadi water, the net electrochemical forces driving Na+ inwards (+9.9 mV) and Cl− outwards (+3.4 mV) are small relative to the strong gradient driving HCO3− inwards (−82.7 mV). Estimated permeability ratios are PCl/PNa = 0.51–0.68 and $$ P_{{{\text{HCO}}_{3} }} /P_{\text{Na}} $$ = 0.10–0.33. The low permeability to HCO3− is unusual, and reflects a unique adaptation to life in extreme alkalinity. Cl− is distributed close to Nernst equilibrium in Magadi water, so there is no need for lower PCl. The higher PNa likely facilitates Na+ efflux through the paracellular pathway. The positive electrogenic component is probably due to active HCO3− excretion.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Seventeen percent of neurons displayed paradoxical latency shift, i.e. their response latency increased with increasing sound level. Three types of paradoxical latency shift were found: (1) stable, that does not depend on sound duration, (2) duration-dependent, that grows with increasing sound duration, and (3) progressive, whose magnitude increases with increasing sound level. The temporal properties of paradoxical latency shift neurons compare well with those of neurons having long-lasting oscillatory responses, i.e. median inter-spike intervals and paradoxical latency shift below 6 ms are overrepresented. In addition, oscillatory and paradoxical latency shift neurons behave similarly when tested with tones of different durations.

Among odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises), it has been suggested that porpoises may have temporal processing abilities which differ from other odontocetes because of their relatively narrow auditory filters and longer duration echolocation signals. This study examined auditory temporal resolution in two Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) to measure: (a) rate following responses and modulation rate transfer function for 100 kHz centered pulse sounds and (b) hearing thresholds and response amplitudes generated by individual pulses of different durations. The animals followed pulses well at modulation rates up to 1,250 Hz, after which response amplitudes declined until extinguished beyond 2,500 Hz. The subjects had significantly better hearing thresholds for longer, narrower-band pulses similar to porpoise echolocation signals compared to brief, broadband sounds resembling dolphin clicks. Results indicate that the Yangtze finless porpoise follows individual acoustic signals at rates similar to other odontocetes tested. Relatively good sensitivity for longer duration, narrow-band signals suggests that finless porpoise hearing is well suited to detect their unique echolocation signals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, little is known about the neural circuits that perform the visual motor computations that underlie this ability. We investigated the motor neurons that innervate two neck muscles (m44 and m51), which produce stabilizing yaw movements of the head. Intracellular recordings were made from five (out of eight) identified neuron types in the first cervical nerve (IK1) of honeybees. Two motor neurons that innervate muscle 51 were found to be direction-selective, with a preference for horizontal image motion from the contralateral to the ipsilateral side of the head. Three neurons that innervate muscle 44 were tuned to detect motion in the opposite direction (from ipsilateral to contralateral). These cells were binocularly sensitive and responded optimally to frontal stimulation. By combining the directional tuning of the motor neurons in an opponent manner, the neck motor system would be able to mediate reflexive optomotor head turns in the direction of image motion, thus stabilising the retinal image. When the dorsal ocelli were covered, the spontaneous activity of neck motor neurons increased and visual responses were modified, suggesting an ocellar input in addition to that from the compound eyes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This perfusion caused gradual distension of the caecum as a result of relative restriction of outflow from the ampulla caecalis. The body of the caecum exhibited two patterns of motility that appeared autonomous, i.e. occurred independently of any contractile activity at the inlet or outlet. Firstly, the pattern that we termed ladder activity consisted of an orderly sequential contraction of bundles of axially oriented circular muscle between the spiral turns of longitudinal muscle and proceeded either from base to tip or from tip to base at a similar frequency and velocity. Secondly, less-localised, rapidly propagating synchronous contractions of both circular and longitudinal muscle, which were more common when the caecum was distended, that were termed mass peristalsis. Movements of the ileum and sacculus rotundus occurred at the same frequency and were broadly coordinated. Distension of the distal sacculus occurred synchronously with contraction of the ileum and did not propagate in an orderly manner across the structure, i.e. was instantaneous. This pattern was consistent with hydrostatic distension. Contractions propagated through the ampulla caecalis in either an orad or an aborad direction at a similar frequency to, and broadly correlated with, those in the ileum. The frequencies of distension of the sacculus and of contraction in the ileum and ampulla were momentarily augmented during mass peristalsis. The authors conclude that there was some coordination between the contractile activity of the terminal ileum and the caecal ampulla during periods of ongoing inflow from the ileum and between these structures and the caecum during mass peristalsis.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, the relative importance of these cues is not well understood. Bees are the most important animal pollinators worldwide and here, we determined the importance of decoupled and combined visual and olfactory cues of Lysimachia punctata (Primulaceae) for host plant location in both sexes of the specialized, solitary bee, Macropis fulvipes (Melittidae). Lysimachia-inexperienced female bees preferred olfactory over visual cues though visual cues increased the attractiveness of olfactory ones. In experienced females, the importance of visual cues was increased. Both Lysimachia-naive and -experienced males relied more on visual cues as compared to females. This study demonstrates that the relative weighting of cues used for host plant finding depends on the sex and experience of M. fulvipes. The latter finding reveals the presence of learning-induced behavioural plasticity in host plant finding for a bee species. It may allow the bee to forage highly efficient. Visually guided female detection on flowers by males is a likely functional explanation for the differences in the weighting of visual and olfactory cues between the sexes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In our study, we incorporated ecologically relevant treatments to examine the effects of environmental stochasticity on the thermal acclimation of the fall field cricket (Gryllus pennsylvanicus). We raised crickets for 5 weeks at either a constant temperature (25°C) or at one of three thermal regimes mimicking a seasonal decline in temperature (from 25 to 12°C). The latter three treatments differed in their level of thermal stochasticity: crickets experienced either no diel cycle, a predictable diel cycle, or an unpredictable diel cycle. Following these treatments, we measured several traits considered relevant to survival or reproduction, including growth rate, jumping velocity, feeding rate, metabolic rate, and cold tolerance. Contrary to our predictions, the acclimatory responses of crickets were unrelated to the magnitude or type of thermal variation. Furthermore, acclimation of performance was not ubiquitous among traits.

Energy intake, resting metabolic rate, nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), and serum tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels increased while serum leptin and body mass decreased in the cold seasons. Serum T3 levels were positively correlated with NST and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) contents in brown adipose tissue, and leptin levels were negatively correlated with energy intake and resting metabolic rate. Furthermore, laboratory data showed these changes could be induced by short photoperiod alone. Taken together, our results indicate that Maximowicz’s voles can increase thermogenic capacity and energy intake to cope with cold stress. Serum leptin seems to be involved in the regulation of energy intake and changes in T3 level may be important for the variations in NST and/or UCP1.

We found that adult forR (rover) flies with high PKG activity were incapacitated faster under hyperthermic conditions of 39°C compared to their lower PKG activity counterparts fors and fors2 (sitters), but not at higher temperatures.

Our studies show that net transpiration rate of females correlates with frequency of mating (small increase after exposure to low numbers of males; large increase after exposure to large numbers of males), and this is reflected by reduced female survivorship for as much as 22 days at 75% RH, 25°C. Water loss occurs up to 28% more rapidly in females after being held with large groups of males. Females that were exposed to males having their paramere removed, females exposed only to other females, and females kept in isolation (unmated) exhibited no reduction in ability to retain water, indicating that traumatic insemination was responsible for the net transpiration rate increase. Mechanical piercing of the female’s abdominal wall leads to increased net transpiration rates for longer periods than puncturing the ectospermalege (regular mating site), implying that inaccurate copulation by males is extremely detrimental to the water balance of females and that the ectospermalege is uniquely modified to seal off more quickly to prevent excess water loss. Mating frequency and the associated increased water loss is considerably reduced by the addition of bed bug alarm pheromone components. Thus, females experience elevated water stress due to traumatic insemination, especially at high levels and when males fail to pierce the ectospermalege, and water loss prevention, likely by more rapid sealing of the wound, is a novel function of the ectopsermalege.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This allocation to particular tasks is frequently stable and predicted by individual physiology. Social insects are excellent model organisms in which to investigate the interplay between physiology and individual behavior, as division of labor is an important feature within colonies, and individual physiology varies among the highly related individuals of the colony. Previous studies have investigated what factors are important in determining how likely an individual is, compared to nestmates, to perform certain tasks. One such task is foraging. Corpulence (i.e., percent lipid) has been shown to determine foraging propensity in honey bees and ants, with leaner individuals being more likely to be foragers. Is this a general trend across all social insects? Here we report data analyzing the individual physiology, specifically the percent lipid, of worker bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) from whom we also analyze behavioral task data. Bumble bees are also unusual among the social bees in that workers may vary widely in size.

This phenomenon, which we call “landing suppression”, indicates that the cue for landing differs from the cue for visually locating a flower. We hypothesized that a possible cue for landing was intensity contrast between the target and background, and have initiated to test this hypothesis. We tested the butterflies’ landing behavior to targets of various colors and intensities presented on background of black or various densities of gray.

The present study investigated the hypothesis that ambient temperature is a cue capable of inducing changes in body mass, energy intake, and thermogenic capacity. Moreover, the current study determined the potential role of leptin in regulating adaptive thermogenesis in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri). The tree shrew was chosen as the experimental animal as they inhabit a wide area of Asia and must acclimatize to the cold. Animals were subjected to either 5°C over 28 days to simulate cold acclimation, or maintained under the original climate of room temperature. At 28 days cold-acclimatized shrews had increased body mass by 9.41 g compared to controls. The increase in body mass was found primarily to be due to growth of the digestive organs, combined with significantly increased food intake. Under cold acclimation, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) was significantly elevated, while serum leptin concentration was significantly depressed below control levels. Serum leptin concentration was negatively correlated with body mass, energy intake, and thermogenic capacity during cold acclimation.

Despite recent advances, the precise molecular mechanisms behind the lymphangiogenic process remain unclear. The Australian marbled gecko, Christinus marmoratus, voluntarily drops its tail (autotomy) as a predator avoidance strategy. Following autotomy a new tail is regenerated including lymphatic drainage pathways. We examined the molecular control of lymphangiogenesis within the unique model of the regenerating gecko tail. Partial sequences were obtained of the gecko lymphangiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D along with their receptor VEGFR-3. These were highly homologous to other vertebrates. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated up-regulation of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 mRNA expression during the early and middle stages of tail regeneration (between 4 and 9 weeks following autotomy), in late regeneration (12 weeks) and during mid-regeneration (7 and 9 weeks), respectively. VEGF-C and VEGF-D immunostaining was observed lining some lymphatic-like and blood vessels in early–mid tail regeneration, indicating possible associations of the proteins with VEGFRs on endothelia. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts also showed positive staining of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in early–mid tail regeneration. Additionally, VEGF-C was localised in adipose tissue in all tail states examined. This work suggests that specific timings exist for the expression of the lymphangiogenic growth factors, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, and their receptor, VEGF-R3, throughout the regeneration of a functional lymphatic network.

We found that repetitive stimulation with a 1 s interstimulus interval led to habituation of the response the lateral giant in control animals at 22°C. Neither heat nor cold preconditioning had any effect on the probability of evoking a response in the lateral giant nor on the rate at which habituation occurred. With a 1 min interstimulus interval, however, the rate of habituation of the lateral giant in the heat-preconditioned group was less than either the control or cold-preconditioned animals. The effect of heat or cold pre-exposure was specific to the input to the lateral giant at control temperatures. For example, at 22°C prior heat and cold preconditioning had no effect on spontaneous reductor motor neurone activity. They did, however, provide thermoprotection at extreme temperatures, with the probability of spontaneous activity higher in the cold-preconditioned group at low temperatures but higher in the heat-preconditioned group at higher temperatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Differential patterns of hormone levels often underlie the reproductive division of labor observed among colony members, and further task partitioning among workers is also often correlated with differences in juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid content. We measured JH and ecdysteroid content of workers and queens of the ant Harpegnathos saltator. In this species, new colonies are founded by a single queen, but after she dies workers compete in an elaborate dominance tournament to decide a new group of reproductives termed “gamergates.” Our comparisons revealed that queens, gamergates, and inside workers (non-reproductive) did not differ in levels of JH or ecdysteroids. However, increased JH and decreased ecdysteroid content was observed in outside workers exhibiting foraging behavior. Application of a JH analog to virgin queens of H. saltator, although effective at inducing dealation, failed to promote egg production. Together, these results support the hypothesis that JH has lost its reproductive function in H. saltator to regulate foraging among the worker caste.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Whereas the physical properties of membrane fatty acids affect the activity of membrane proteins and, indirectly, an animal’s BMR, it is the susceptibility of those fatty acids to peroxidation which influence MLSP. Although there is a correlation between body size and MLSP, there is considerable MLSP variation independent of body size. For example, among bird families, Galliformes (fowl) are relatively short-living and Psittaciformes (parrots) are unusually long-living, with some parrot species reaching maximum lifespans of more than 100 years. We determined BMR and tissue phospholipid fatty acid composition in seven tissues from three species of parrots with an average MLSP of 27 years and from two species of quails with an average MLSP of 5.5 years. We also characterised mitochondrial phospholipids in two of these tissues. Neither BMR nor membrane susceptibility to peroxidation corresponded with differences in MLSP among the birds we measured. We did find that (1) all birds had lower n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content in mitochondrial membranes compared to those of the corresponding tissue, and that (2) irrespective of reliance on flight for locomotion, both pectoral and leg muscle had an almost identical membrane fatty acid composition in all birds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Essential oils offer an attractive alternative to the use of synthetic chemicals for the control of varroa. Amongst them, thymol appears to be particularly promising. However, treatments using thymol as their active substance, such as the gel formulation Apiguard®, are suspected to have adverse effects on honey bee colonies. In this study, laboratory assays are used to investigate the effects of Apiguard® exposure on honey bee behaviour. Our results reveal that honey bee responses to this anti-varroa treatment change with honey bee age. While 2-day-old bees respond neutrally to Apiguard®, older bees generally avoid the Apiguard® gel. Responses of forager bees were particularly striking. Foragers appear to be repelled by Apiguard®. Touching their antennae with Apiguard® induces robust fanning behaviour. Our data suggest, however, that forager bees exposed to Apiguard® in the hive can become habituated to this treatment. These results offer interesting new perspectives on the effects of Apiguard® on honey bee behaviour and serve to highlight age-related changes in honey bee responses to gustatory, as well as olfactory cues.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Incubation of isolated atrium with paraoxon (5 × 10−6–5 × 10−5 M) caused significant reduction of action potential duration and marked slowing of sinus rhythm. These effects were abolished by muscarinic blocker atropine and therefore are caused by acetylcholine, which accumulates in the myocardium due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition even in the absence of vagal input. Hemicholinium III is a blocker of high affinity choline-uptake transporters, which are believed to mediate non-quantal release of acetylcholine from cholinergic terminals in different tissues. In the atrial myocardium of all the three studied species, hemicholinium III (10−5 M) significantly suppressed all the effects of paraoxon. Blocker of parasympathetic ganglionic transmission hexamethonium bromide (10−4 M) and inhibitor of vesicular acetylcholine transporters vesamicol (10−5 M) failed to attenuate paraoxon effects. Among ventricular myocardium preparations of three species paraoxon provoked marked cholinergic effects only in frog, hemicholinium III abolished these effects effectively. We conclude that paraoxon stops degradation of acetylcholine in the myocardium and helps to reveal the effects of acetylcholine, which is continuously secreted from the cholinergic nerves in non-quantal manner. Thus, non-quantal release of acetylcholine in the heart is not specific only for mammals, but is also present in the hearts of different vertebrates.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hypoxia impacts tissue ATP supply and can induce mitochondrial dysfunction that elevates reactive species release. The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllum ocellatum, is remarkably tolerant of severe hypoxia at temperatures up to 34°C, and therefore provides a valuable model to study warm hypoxia tolerance. Mitochondrial function was tested in saponin permeabilised ventricle fibres using high-resolution respirometry coupled with purpose-built fluorospectrometers. Ventricular mitochondrial function, stability and reactive species production of the epaulette shark was compared with that of the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata. Fibres were prepared from each species acclimated to normoxic water conditions, or following a 2 h, acute hypoxic exposure at levels representing 40% of each species’ critical oxygen tension. Although mitochondrial respiratory fluxes for normoxia-acclimated animals were similar for both species, reactive species production in the epaulette shark was approximately half that of the shovelnose ray under normoxic conditions, even when normalised to tissue oxidative phosphorylation flux. The hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray halved oxidative phosphorylation flux and cytochrome c oxidase flux was depressed by 34% following hypoxic stress. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation flux of the epaulette shark ventricular fibres isolated from acute hypoxia exposed the animals remained similar to those from normoxia-acclimated animals. However, uncoupling of respiration revealed depressed electron transport systems in both species following hypoxia exposure. Overall, the epaulette shark ventricular mitochondria showed greater oxidative phosphorylation stability and lower reactive species outputs with hypoxic exposure, and this may protect cardiac bioenergetic function in hypoxic tropical waters.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We have studied the iridescence in the males of a few members of Coliadinae, Gonepteryx aspasia, G. cleopatra, G. rhamni, and Colias croceus, and in two members of the Colotis group, Hebomoia glaucippe and Colotis regina. Imaging scatterometry demonstrated that the pigmentary colouration is diffuse whereas the structural colouration creates a directional, line-shaped far-field radiation pattern. Angle-dependent reflectance measurements demonstrated that the directional iridescence distinctly varies among closely related species. The species-dependent scale curvature determines the spatial properties of the wing iridescence. Narrow beam illumination of flat scales results in a narrow far-field iridescence pattern, but curved scales produce broadened patterns.

Males may attract females into their nests for spawning by releasing reproductive pheromones, and it has been previously shown that reproductive males synthesize and release the 5β-reduced and 3α-hydroxyl steroids 3α-hydroxy-5β-androstane-11,17-dione (11-oxo-etiocholanolone; 11-O-ETIO) and 3α-hydroxy-5β-androstane-11,17-dione 3-sulfate (11-oxo-etiocholanolone-3-sulfate; 11-O-ETIO-3-s) and 3α,17β-dihydroxy-5β-androstan-11-one 17-sulfate.

Here, we examine body condition, endogenous T levels and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) as non-invasive measures of CORT in sibling broods of wild common tern chicks (Sterna hirundo) during three post-natal developmental stages. In this species, distinct within-brood size asymmetries are imposed by an asynchronous hatching interval, and sexes show slightly different growth patterns. First-hatched (a-)chicks were in better condition than their later-hatched sibling (b-chick). FGM levels inversely covaried with condition and were elevated at the end of pre-fledging development. T levels of a- and b-chicks changed with age, although the direction of the changes differed, with b-chicks eventually having higher levels than their older siblings. Survival to fledging was not associated with FGM but with T levels, which tended to be higher in surviving chicks.

Here, some of the most fundamental properties of spatial vision in barn owls are reviewed. The eye with its tubular shape is rigidly integrated in the skull so that eye movements are very much restricted. The eyes are oriented frontally, allowing for a large binocular overlap. Accommodation, but not pupil dilation, is coupled between the two eyes. The retina is rod dominated and lacks a visible fovea. Retinal ganglion cells form a marked region of highest density that extends to a horizontally oriented visual streak. Behavioural visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are poor, although the optical quality of the ocular media is excellent. A low f-number allows high image quality at low light levels. Vernier acuity was found to be a hyperacute percept. Owls have global stereopsis with hyperacute stereo acuity thresholds. Neurons of the visual Wulst are sensitive to binocular disparities.

Sockeye migrating through seawater and freshwater showed consistent declines in gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity, plasma osmolality and plasma chloride concentration. In contrast, plasma sodium concentration became elevated in seawater as fish approached the river mouth and was then restored after sockeye entered the river. Accompanying the movement from seawater to freshwater was a significant increase in mRNA for the NKA α1a subunit in the gill, with little change in the α1b subunit. Potential endocrine signals stimulating the physiological changes during migration were assessed by measuring plasma cortisol and prolactin (Prl) concentrations and quantifying mRNA extracted from the gill for glucocorticoid receptors 1 and 2 (GR1 and GR2), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), growth hormone 1 receptor (GH1R), and prolactin receptor (PrlR). Plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations were high in seawater suggesting a preparatory endocrine signal before freshwater entry. Generally, the mRNA expression for GR1, GR2 and MR declined during migration, most notably after fish entered freshwater. In contrast, PrlR mRNA increased throughout migration, particularly as sockeye approached the spawning grounds. A highly significant association existed between gill PrlR mRNA and gill NKA α1a mRNA. GH1R mRNA also increased significantly, but only after sockeye had migrated beyond tidal influence in the river and then again just before the fish reached the spawning grounds.

This is a key component of their osmoregulatory strategy presenting the challenge of excreting excess salts while achieving a net retention of water. The intestine has an established role in osmoregulation, and its ability to effectively absorb fluid is crucial to compensating for water losses to the hyperosmotic environment. Despite this, the potential for the teleost intestine to serve as a comparative model for detailed, integrative experimental studies on epithelial water transport has so far gone largely untapped. The following review aims to present an assessment of the teleost intestine as a fluid-transporting epithelium. Beginning with a brief overview of marine teleost osmoregulation, emphasis shifts to the processing of ingested seawater by the gastrointestinal tract and the characteristics of intestinal ion and fluid transport. Particular attention is given to acid–base transfers by the intestine, specifically bicarbonate secretion, which creates the distinctly alkaline gut fluids responsible for the formation of solid calcium carbonate precipitates. The respective contributions of these unique features to intestinal fluid absorption, alongside other recognised ion transport processes, are then subsequently considered within the wider context of the classic physiological problem of epithelial water transport.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Earlier studies of electrophysiological responses in certain neurons of the brain to changing ambient magnetic fields suggest that although certain identified brain cells fire impulses when the ambient field is changed, these neuron somata and their central dentritic and axonal processes are themselves not primary magnetic receptors. Here, using semi-intact animal preparations from which the brain was removed, we recorded from peripheral nerve trunks. Using techniques to count spikes in individual nerves and separately also to identify, then count individual axonal spikes in extracellular records, we found both excitatory and inhibitory axonal responses elicited by changes in the direction of ambient earth strength magnetic fields. We found responses in nerves from many locations throughout the body and in axons innervating the body wall and rhinophores.

However, GC concentrations can also be modulated by predictable events, such as changes in season or life history stage. Understanding normative patterns of adrenal activity is critical for making valid conclusions about changes in GC concentrations. In this study, we validated an assay for monitoring fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) in Canada lynx. We then used this technique to assess patterns of adrenal activity in Canada lynx across several contexts. Our results show that captive lynx have higher FGM concentrations than wild lynx, which may be related to differences in stress levels, metabolic rate, diet, or body condition. We also found that FGM concentrations are correlated with reproductive status in females, but not in males. For males, seasonal increases in FGM expression coincide with the onset of the breeding season, whereas in females, FGM increase toward the end of the breeding season.

A haematological approach,"Although the vertebrate stress response is essential for survival, frequent or prolonged stress responses can result in chronic physiological stress, which is associated with a suite of conditions that can impair survivorship and reproductive output. Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and degradation are potential stressors of free-living vertebrates, and in theory could result in chronic stress. To address this issue, we compared haematological indicators of stress and condition in agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis) populations in 30 forest fragments and 30 undisturbed, continuous forest sites (pseudofragments) in south-eastern Australia over 2 years. In peripheral blood, the total leucocyte count was lower and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and percentage of eosinophils in the total leucocyte population was higher in fragment than pseudofragment populations, indicating that fragment populations were probably experiencing higher levels of stress hormone-mediated and/or parasite infection-related chronic physiological stress. The total erythrocyte count and haematocrit were higher and mean erythrocyte haemoglobin content was lower in fragment than pseudofragment populations. This suggests that fragment populations showed possible signs of regenerative anaemia, a syndrome associated with elevated hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis mediated stress. However, mean erythrocyte volume was also lower in fragments, and red blood cell distribution width did not differ between the study populations, findings which were not consistent with this diagnosis. Whole blood and mean cell haemoglobin concentrations were similar in fragment and pseudofragment populations. We suggest that where anthropogenic activity results in habitat fragmentation and degradation, chronic stress could contribute to a decline in agile antechinus populations. The broader implication is that chronic stress could be both symptomatic of, and contributing to, decline of some vertebrate populations in anthropogenically fragmented and degraded habitats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

CTMax was not affected by repeated daily heat shock, but increased within a few days in response to warm acclimation. Loss of tolerance with acclimation to lowered temperatures occurred more slowly. Exposure to hypoxia decreased CTMax, and hyperoxia had no effect. CTMax showed a daily rhythm in both subspecies. Thermal acclimation changed the value of CTMax but did not affect the amplitude of the rhythm. Exposure to altered photoperiod had complex effects with a summer photoperiod producing a daily rhythm at higher CTMax than a spring photoperiod, and a winter photoperiod removing the rhythm. There was no daily rhythm in routine metabolic rate in either subspecies. There was no relationship between CTMax and the protein levels of the constitutive 70 and 90 kDa heat shock proteins (HSC70, HSP90β) in gill, or with mRNA levels of hsc70 in liver. There was a daily rhythm in the basal levels of the inducible hsp70-2 mRNA. Induction of hsp70-2 mRNA with mild heat shock occurred only in the evening and at night, and not during the day.

The sturgeon had higher lipid-degradation capacity and greater synthesis of hepatic ketone bodies than the trout, although this latter species also showed strong synthesis of ketone bodies during starvation. During refeeding, the metabolic activity present before starvation was recovered in both fish, with a reestablishment of tissue reserves, plasmatic parameters (glucemia and cholesterol), and enzymatic activities in the liver and muscle.

We show that patterns of core body temperature (Tb) can be used to precisely determine the timing of key seasonal events including hibernation, mating and parturition, and immergence and emergence from the hibernacula in free-living arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii). Using temperature loggers that recorded Tb every 20 min for up to 18 months, we monitored core Tb from three females that subsequently gave birth in captivity and from 66 female and 57 male ground squirrels free-living in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range Alaska. In addition, dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed for four free-living male squirrels. Average Tb in captive females decreased by 0.5–1.0°C during gestation and abruptly increased by 1–1.5°C on the day of parturition. In free-living females, similar shifts in Tb were observed in 78% (n = 9) of yearlings and 94% (n = 31) of adults; females without the shift are assumed not to have given birth. Three of four ground squirrels for which dates of emergence from hibernation were visually confirmed did not exhibit obvious diurnal rhythms in Tb until they first emerged onto the surface when Tb patterns became diurnal.

The invasive slug Arion lusitanicus has spread to most parts of Europe, where it often is considered as a serious pest. There is a need for better knowledge of its ecophysiology to be able to predict the effect of climatic factors, such as temperature and humidity on the population dynamics and abundance. The aim of the present study was to assemble data on the water balance and drought tolerance of eggs and juveniles of A. lusitanicus. Both eggs and juveniles had little capacity to prevent evaporative water loss and lost water when the ambient humidity fell below 99.8 and 99.5%, respectively. The water conductance of the cuticle of juveniles was 242 μg cm−2 h−1 mmHg−1 and resembles that of other slug species. Both eggs and juveniles of A. lusitanicus tolerate a substantial water loss. There was no difference in water loss resistance between eggs and juveniles, but the eggs were slightly more tolerant to water loss than the juveniles. The percent water loss causing 50% mortality was 72% for the juveniles and 81% for the eggs. Despite A. lusitanicus’ tolerance of substantial water loss, its survival depends on humid habitats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, recent studies in songbirds suggest that other steroids may also be important. For example, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be synthesized by the gonads, adrenal glands, and/or brain and locally metabolized into T and 17β-estradiol (E2). Here, we examined DHEA and E2 levels in the brain, peripheral tissues, and plasma of wild European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). In Study 1, samples were collected from males and females at P0 (day of hatch), P6, and P8. In Study 2, samples were collected at P4. At P0, DHEA levels in the diencephalon were higher in males than females. DHEA levels were generally high in the gonads and adrenals, and they were higher in testes than ovaries at P8. Further, E2 levels were non-detectable in most brain samples, suggesting that DHEA was not metabolized to E2 or that locally produced E2 was rapidly inactivated. At P4, DHEA levels in telencephalic regions were lower in males than females. Taken together, these data suggest that sex differences in peripheral DHEA secretion and neural DHEA metabolism at specific ages during development might play a role in sexual differentiation of the songbird brain.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

An ordinary least squares regression fitted the data best and body mass explained 95% of the variation in BMR. There was no phylogenetic signal in the BMR data. We also provide new data for the Greater Vasa Parrot (Coracopsis vasa) of Madagascar. We tested the hypotheses that C. vasa may, because of its insular existence, display conservative energetic traits (low BMR, use of adaptive heterothermy) similar to those observed in several Malagasy mammals. However, this was not the case. C. vasa had a higher BMR than other parrots, especially during summer, when BMR was up-regulated by 50.5% and was 95.7% higher than predicted from an ordinary least squares (OLS) allometry of parrots (BMR = 0.042Mb0.649, BMR in Watts, Mb in grammes).

The summer up-regulation of BMR is the highest recorded for a bird of any size to date.

Each pecten has thousands of pore-tipped sensilla sensitive to a variety of volatile organic and water-based stimulants. However, it was previously unknown whether individual sensilla were functionally identical or different.

The information segmentation hypothesis states that sensilla differ in their chemosensitivities, a functional arrangement akin to the glomeruli-specific chemical detection system in the moth or human olfactory sense. In this study, we tested these hypotheses by extracellularly tip-recording sensillar responses to three aqueous tastants: 0.01 M KCl, 0.1 M citric acid, and 40% ethanol by volume. We isolated stimulation to one sensillum at a time and compared the chemoresponses. Sensilla appeared to respond similarly to the same stimulant (i.e., sensillar tip-recordings revealed activity of the same cell types), although sometimes a few sensilla responded with higher spike rates than the others.

Females of both groups received the same respective diets, and reproductive parameters were evaluated upon parturition. Additionally, hormonal data were obtained from blood and feces. The stress exposure induced a significant increase in plasma cortisol concentrations during the afternoon. In contrast to this short-term response in plasma cortisol concentrations, we found no significant differences in the levels of cortisol metabolites in feces collected after stress exposure between groups and even significantly decreased levels of fecal cortisol metabolites on non-stress days over time in treatment females. Among treatment females, gain in body weight was attenuated over gestation and body weight was lower compared to control females during lactation, especially in cases of large litter sizes. No differences could be seen in the reproductive parameters.

In addition, fish held on a natural photoperiod in fresh water at 19°C showed peaks in cortisol, thyroid hormones and gill and pyloric ceca Na+, K+-ATPase activities at body sizes associated with seawater tolerance. Therefore, salinity tolerance in green sturgeon increases during ontogeny (e.g., as these juveniles may move down estuaries to the ocean) with increases in body size. Also, physiological and morphological changes associated with seawater readiness increased in freshwater-reared juveniles and peaked at their seawater-tolerant ages and body sizes.

Honey bee queens produce a pheromone (queen mandibular pheromone; QMP) which regulates aspects of worker bee behavior and physiology. Forager bees are less responsive to QMP than young bees engaged in brood care, suggesting that physiological changes associated with behavioral maturation modulate response to this pheromone. Since 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a major regulator of behavioral maturation in workers, we examined its role in modulating worker responses to QMP. Treatment with a cGMP analog resulted in significant reductions in both behavioral and physiological responses to QMP in young caged workers. Treatment significantly reduced attraction to QMP and inhibited the QMP-mediated increase in vitellogenin RNA levels in the fat bodies of worker bees. Genome-wide analysis of brain gene expression patterns demonstrated that cGMP has a larger effect on expression levels than QMP, and that QMP has specific effects in the presence of cGMP, suggesting that some responses to QMP may be dependent on an individual bees’ physiological state. Our data suggest that cGMP-mediated processes play a role in modulating responses to QMP in honey bees at the behavioral, physiological, and molecular levels.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

On the basis of electrophysiological evidence, it has been proposed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) regulates both electrical and secretory activity of the XO-SG system. In this work we observed that depolarizing current pulses to neurons located in the external rim of the X-organ induced repetitive firing that suppressed the spontaneous firing of previously active X-organ neurons. Picrotoxin reversibly blocked this inhibitory effect suggesting that the GABA released from the stimulated neuron inhibited neighboring cells. Immunoperoxidase in X-organ serial sections showed co-localization of GABA and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) including the aforementioned neurons. Immunofluorescence in whole mount preparations showed that two subpopulations of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone-containing neurons colocalized with GABA. The expression of GAD mRNA was determined in crayfish tissue and X-organ single cells by RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis shows, within the amplified region, 90.4% consensus and 41.9% identity at the amino acid level compared with Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.

The vascular changes accompanying this transition have been partly characterized in mammals. We investigated, using wire myography, the developmental changes in chick mesenteric artery (MA) reactivity. Rings of the MA from 15-day (E15) and 19-day (E19) chicken embryos (total incubation 21 days) as well as non-fed 0–3-h-old (NH3h) and first-fed 1-day-old (NH1d) newly hatched chicks contracted in response to KCl, norepinephrine (NE), U46619, and endothelin (ET)-1 and relaxed in response to acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and forskolin indicating the presence of electro- and pharmaco-mechanical coupling as well as cGMP- and cAMP-mediated relaxation. In ovo development and transition to ex ovo life was accompanied by alterations in the response of the MAs, but a different developmental trajectory was observed for each reactivity pathway tested. Thus, the contractile efficacy of KCl underwent a linear increase (E15 < E19 < NH3h < NH1d). The efficacy of NE and U46619 increased in ovo, but not ex ovo (E15 < E19 = NH3h = NH1d) and the efficacy of ET-1 peaked at E19 (E15 < E19 > NH3h = NH1d). The relaxations elicited by ACh (endothelium-dependent), SNP, and forskolin did not undergo significant developmental changes. In conclusion, the ability of chick MAs to constrict in response to pharmacological stimuli increases during the embryonic period, but no dramatic changes are induced by hatching or the first feeding.

In harvester ants, whether female progeny develop into workers or daughter queens is strongly influenced by the age and temperature conditions experienced by their mother, which is associated with variation in maternal ecdysteroid deposition in fertilized eggs. In many insects, juvenile hormone (JH) is antagonistic to ecdysteroid release, suggesting that seasonal and age-based variation in maternal JH titers may explain maternal effects on offspring size and reproductive caste. To test this hypothesis, we artificially increased maternal JH titers with methoprene, a JH analog, in laboratory colonies of two Pogonomyrmex populations exhibiting genetic caste determination. Increasing maternal JH resulted in a 50% increase in worker body size, as well as a sharp reduction in total number of progeny reared, but did not alter the genotype of progeny reared to adulthood. The intergenerational effect of JH manipulation was not mediated by a reduction in ecdysteroid deposition into eggs; instead, changes in egg size, trophic egg availability or brood/worker ratio may have altered the nutritional environment of developing larvae. Egg ecdysteroid content was significantly negatively correlated with natural variation in worker body size, however, suggesting that there are multiple independent routes by which queens can modify offspring phenotypes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The total mRNA levels of the hemoglobin chains, including a newly identified embryonic α-chain, as well as myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin 1 and 2, and globin X were estimated. mRNAs of all globins were detectable in unfertilized eggs, suggesting maternal storage. Embryonic α- and β-hemoglobin mRNA peaked at hatching and the switch to adult hemoglobin expression occurred 16 dpf. Enhanced myoglobin mRNA levels were detected ~31 h post-fertilization (hpf), coinciding with the heart and the muscle development, while neuroglobin mRNA expression pattern correlates with the formation of the nervous system. Amounts of myoglobin and neuroglobin mRNA were similar within an order of magnitude throughout the ontogeny, tentatively supporting a respiratory role of neuroglobin. Cytoglobin 2 mRNA levels increased gradually, whereas cytoglobin 1 mRNA levels increased strongly after ~31 hpf, which is in agreement with a function in cell proliferation. Globin X mRNA level was highest in oocytes, but low in later stages.

Addition of cortisol to the basolateral compartment increased TER twofold and reduced PRD threefold over a 5-day period. A similar increase in TER could be seen after 24 h apical freshwater (FW) in control cultures. In cortisol-treated cultures FW exposure did not change TER, but PRD increased significantly. Histochemical staining of the cytoskeleton of cells in SSI culture revealed a morphological partitioning into a single mucosal layer of polarized, polygonal cells featuring cortical F-actin rings which were comparable to F-actin rings of epithelial cells on the lamellar and filamental surface, and several unorganized serosal layers of cells with F-actin stress fibers. Addition of cortisol increased cell density by 18% and in the mucosal layer it led to smaller, less polygonal cells with increased height and increased cell contact area. In transmission electron microscopic images two pairs of cytoplasmatic electron-dense structures confining the zonula occludens apically and basally toward the zonula adhaerens were found. Addition of cortisol increased the distance between those paired structures, hence led to deeper tight junctions. The cortisol-induced increase in barrier properties, therefore, involves a structural fortification of the tight junctions which was not generally modified by a short 24-h apical freshwater stress.

The sea bass is particularly sensitive to stressful conditions and the mere presence of humans will disturb feeding behavior. In this paper, we study whether chronic stress induced by repetition of acute stress protocols affects long-term feeding behavior and growth performance in sea bass and whether exogenous cortisol may induce stress-like changes in these parameters. We demonstrate that both chronic stress and dietary cortisol decrease food intake and have a negative effect on feed conversion efficiency, severely impairing sea bass performance. Both experimental approaches induced changes in the daily feeding activity by lengthening the active feeding periods. Fish subjected to a cyclic stressor modify their daily feeding pattern in an attempt to avoid interference with the time of the stressor. The delay in feeding when fish are acutely and repeatedly stressed could be of substantial adaptive importance.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Investigating the spatio-temporal calling behavior of nocturnal animals, e.g., frogs and crickets, has been difficult because of the need to distinguish many animals’ calls in noisy environments without being able to see them.

The Firefly, which consists of a microphone and a light emitting diode, emits light when it captures nearby sound. Deploying dozens of Fireflies in a target area, we record calls of multiple individuals through the video camera. We conduct two experiments, one indoors and the other in the field, using Japanese tree frogs (Hyla japonica). The indoor experiment demonstrates that our method correctly visualizes Japanese tree frogs’ calling behavior. It has confirmed the known behavior; two frogs call synchronously or in anti-phase synchronization. The field experiment (in a rice paddy where Japanese tree frogs live) also visualizes the same calling behavior to confirm anti-phase synchronization in the field.

The evolution of squamate viviparity has occurred remarkably frequently (>108 times) and has resulted in major changes in reproductive physiology. Such frequent changes in reproductive strategy pose two questions: (1) what are the molecular mechanisms responsible for the evolution of squamate viviparity? (2) Are these molecular mechanisms the same for separate origins of viviparity? Molecular approaches, such as RT-PCR, in situ hybridisation, Western blotting and immunofluorescence, have been invaluable for identifying genes and proteins that are involved in squamate placental development, materno-foetal immunotolerance, placental transport, placental angiogenesis, hormone synthesis and hormone receptor expression. However, the candidate-gene or -protein approach that has been used until now does not allow for de novo gene/protein discovery; results to date suggest that the reproductive physiologies of mammals and squamate reptiles are very similar, but this conclusion may simply be due to a limited capacity to study the subset of genes and proteins that are unique to reptiles. Progress has also been slowed by the lack of appropriate molecular and genomic resources for squamate reptiles. The advent of next-generation sequencing provides a relatively inexpensive way to conduct rapid high-throughput sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes.

How body size affects the cost of incline exercise remains much less clear. Studies on vertebrates have led to the hypotheses that the cost of vertical work is independent of body mass and that the added cost of locomoting on inclines is lower for small animals. Studies on vertebrates and a few invertebrates provide evidence both for and against these hypotheses. To gain further insight into the cost of incline exercise, we measured oxygen consumption of small (2.33 ± 0.07 g) and large (46.66 ± 5.33 g) ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata) locomoting horizontally and up a 20° incline. The slope of the oxygen consumption versus speed relationship (= minimum cost of transport) was not significantly different for small crabs exercising horizontally and on an incline. However, the intercept for incline exercise was significantly higher, indicating that small crabs used more energy during incline exercise than during horizontal exercise. Incline had no effect on the slope or intercept of the oxygen consumption versus speed relationship for large crabs.

The seasonal onset of male calling coincides with inshore migration from deep waters by both sexes and increased female sensitivity to dominant frequencies of male calls. The closely related Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus, (Batrachoididae, Halophryninae) also breeds seasonally and relies on acoustic communication to find mates but, instead, both sexes stay in estuaries and show vocal activity throughout the year. We investigated whether the sensitivity of the inner ear saccule of H. didactylus is seasonally plastic and sexually dimorphic. We recorded evoked potentials from populations of saccular hair cells from non-reproductive and reproductive males and females in response to 15–945 Hz tones. Saccular hair cells were most sensitive at 15–205 Hz (thresholds between 111 and 118 dB re. 1 μPa). Both sexes showed identical hearing sensitivity and no differences were found across seasons. The saccule was well suited to detect conspecific vocalizations and low frequencies that overlapped with lateral line sensitivity. We showed that the saccule in H. didactylus has major importance in acoustic communication throughout the year and that significant sensory differences may exist between the two batrachoidid subfamilies.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Tethered, adult females watched computer generated stimuli (erratically moving disks or linearly moving rectangles) that varied along predetermined parameters. Three responses were scored: tracking, approaching, and striking. Threshold stimulus size (diameter) for tracking and striking at disks ranged from 3.5 deg (C. humeralis) to 7.8 deg (M. religiosa), and from 3.3 deg (C. humeralis) to 11.7 deg (M. religiosa), respectively. Unlike the other species which struck at disks as large as 44 deg, T. a. sinensis displayed a preference for 14 deg disks. Disks moving at 143 deg/s were preferred by all species. M. religiosa exhibited the most approaching behavior, and with T. a. sinensis distinguished between rectangular stimuli moving parallel versus perpendicular to their long axes. C. humeralis did not make this distinction. Stimulus sizes that elicited the target behaviors were not related to mantis size. However, differences in compound eye morphology may be related to species differences: C. humeralis’ eyes are farthest apart, and it has an apparently narrower binocular visual field which may affect retinal inputs to movement-sensitive visual interneurons.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Thus, adaptations to reduce the thermal dependence of physiological processes may be present. We measured the optimal temperature range for sprint speed and compared it with the selected body temperatures (Tsel) of two sympatric, cool-temperate lizards: the diurnal skink Oligosoma maccanni and the primarily nocturnal gecko Woodworthia (previously Hoplodactylus) “Otago/Southland”. We also investigated whether time-of-day influenced sprint speed. Contrary to results for other reptiles, we found that time-of-day did not influence speed in either species. For each species, the optimal temperature range for sprinting and Tsel overlapped, supporting the ‘thermal coadaptation’ hypothesis. However, the optimal range of temperatures for speed is not always attainable during activity by either species, which have limited opportunities to attain Tsel in the field. The thermal sensitivity of sprint speed in these two species does not appear to have evolved to fully match their current thermal environment.

Twenty essential amino acids plus l-DOPA evoked clear, concentration-dependent olfactory responses using both methods, with estimated thresholds of 10−8.5–10−6.2 M (nerve recording) and 10−7.5–10−4.8 M (EOG). The most potent amino acids were l-cysteine, l-methionine (both sulphur-containing), l-alanine, l-leucine (both neutral), l-glutamine (amide-containing) and l-serine (hydroxyl-containing). The least potent were l-proline (secondary α-amino group), the aromatic amino acids and glycine (simplest). Although the rank order of olfactory potency was similar for the two methods used, and the calculated thresholds given by the two methods were positively correlated, the sensitivity of the EOG was consistently lower than multi-unit recording by approximately one order of magnitude, presumably due to the electrical shunting effect of seawater. As in freshwater, the EOG could be a valid method for comparing olfactory potency of different odorants in stenohaline marine fish; however, for absolute ‘biological’ thresholds, a more invasive recording technique, such as multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve, should be used.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Experiments were performed to characterize the structure and responses of tibial campaniform sensilla, receptors that encode forces through cuticular strains, in the middle leg of the stick insect (Carausius morosus). The sensilla consist of distinct subgroups. Group 6A sensilla are located 0.3 mm distal to the femoro-tibial joint and have oval shaped cuticular caps.

Group 6B sensilla respond to force increases in the direction of joint extension while Group 6A receptors discharge when those forces decrease. Forces applied in the direction of joint flexion produce the reverse pattern of sensory discharge. All receptors accurately encode the rate of change of force increments and decrements. Contractions of tibial muscles also produce selective, directional sensory discharges. The subgroups differ in their reflex effects: Group 6B receptors excite and Group 6A sensilla inhibit tibial extensor and trochanteral depressor motoneurons.

Previous studies have shown that in the presence of other environmental stressors including aquatic pH and temperature and the presence of contaminants or pathogens, the lethal effects of UV-B on amphibian larvae are enhanced due to interactions between the stressors. Little is known about the interactions between UV-B and aquatic hypoxia, a common and significant natural stressor of amphibian larvae. We examined the potential effects of UV-B and aquatic hypoxia in combination on embryonic survival, developmental rate, body mass and locomotor performance of embryos and larvae of the striped marsh frog, Limnodynastes peronii. We found that while both UV-B and hypoxia independently had substantial negative effects on the developing embryos of L. peronii, they did not interact in a multiplicative or antagonistic manner. The effects of the stressors in combination were as might be predicted based on the knowledge of their independent actions alone (i.e. an additive effect). In all cases developing embryos exposed to both UV-B and hypoxia were more severely affected than those exposed to either UV-B or hypoxia alone.

While the mechanisms associated with extracellular pH regulation have been well explored, much less is known about intracellular pH (pHi) regulation. There is great interest in developing non-animal models for research. One such model is the rainbow trout hepatoma cell line (RTH 149), which has been used to study a wide range of topics; however, no studies have investigated its potential use in pHi regulation. Employing the pH-sensitive fluoroprobe BCECF, the present study examined pHi regulation in RTH 149 under normocapnia and during extracellular acidification induced by either elevated CO2 or 1 M HCl. During exposure to hypercapnia, RTH 149 cells were acidified without recovery as long as the elevated CO2 was maintained. In addition, rates of pHi recovery from NH4Cl-induced acidosis were significantly lower in cells exposed to hypercapnia or HCl compared to that in normocapnic cells, indicating that elevated CO2 indirectly impeded pHi recovery through a reduction in pHe and/or pHi. Moreover, pHi regulation in RTH 149 was EIPA-sensitive, suggesting that an NHE may be involved. Overall, RTH 149 may have the potential for identifying transporters likely to play a role in pHi regulation in fish. However, it should not be used as a complete replacement for in vivo studies, especially to quantify acid–base regulatory ability at whole animal level, since RTH 149 appeared to have enhanced pHi recovery rates relative to primary hepatocytes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The molt comprises the loss of the old cuticle and, moreover, substantial reduction and re-organization of muscles and connective tissues. In adult lobsters, the muscle tissue of the massive claws undergoes significant atrophy of 40–75% before ecdysis. The degradation of this tissue is facilitated by calcium-dependent proteases and by the proteasome, an intra-cellular proteolytic multi-enzyme complex. In contrast to the adults, the involvement of the proteasome during the larval development is yet not validated. Therefore, we developed micro-methods to measure the 20S and the 26S proteasomal activities within mg- and sub-mg-quantities of the larval claw tissue of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Within the three larval stages (Z1–3) we distinguished between sub-stages of freshly molted/hatched (post-molt), inter-molt, and ready to molt (pre-molt) larvae. Juveniles were analyzed in the post-molt and in the inter-molt stage. The trypsin-like, the chymotrypsin-like, and the peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolase activity (PGPH) of the 20S proteasome increased distinctly from freshly hatched larvae to pre-molt Z1. During the Z2 stage, the activities were highest in the post-molt animals, decreased in the inter-molt animals and increased again in the pre-molt animals. A similar but less distinct trend was evident in the Z3 stages. In the juveniles, the proteasomal activities decreased toward the lowest values. A similar pattern was present for the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome. The results show that the proteasome plays a significant role during the larval development of lobsters. This is not only reflected by the elevated activities, but also by the continuous change of the trypsin/chymotrypsin-ratio which may indicate a shift in the subunit composition of the proteasome and, thus, a biochemical adjustment to better cope with elevated protein turnover rates during larval development.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hypoxia/anoxia disrupts energy metabolism and triggers mechanisms that to support ATP levels while often also suppressing ATP use. Arginine kinase (AK) (E.C. 2.7.3.3) is a crucial enzyme involved in energy metabolism in muscle, gating the use of phosphagen stores to buffer ATP levels. The present study investigated AK from tail muscle of O. virilis identifying changes to kinetic properties, phosphorylation state and structural stability between the enzyme from aerobic control and 20 h anoxic crayfish. Muscle AK from anoxia-exposed crayfish showed a significantly higher (by 59%) Km for l-arginine and a lower I50 value for urea than the aerobic form. Several lines of evidence indicated that AK was converted to a high phosphate form under anoxia: (a) aerobic and anoxic forms of AK showed well-separated elution peaks on DEAE ion exchange chromatography, (b) ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining showed a 64% higher bound phosphate content on anoxic AK compared with the aerobic form, and (c) treatment of anoxic AK with alkaline phosphatase reduced Kml-arginine to aerobic levels whereas incubation of aerobic AK with protein kinase A catalytic subunit raised the Km to anoxic levels. The physiological consequence of anoxia-induced AK phosphorylation may be to suppress AK activity in the phosphagen-synthesizing direction and, together with reduced cellular pH and ATP levels, promote the phosphagen-catabolizing direction under anoxic conditions. This is first time that AK has been shown to be regulated by reversible phosphorylation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

White sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, are exceptionally CO2 tolerant and can regulate tissue intracellular pH (pHi) in the presence of a pronounced hypercapnic acidosis (preferential pHi regulation). In this study, pHi regulatory capacity of sturgeon liver cells in primary culture was examined to assess the suitability of employing this in vitro system to understand in vivo CO2 tolerance in sturgeon. Using the pH-sensitive fluoroprobe BCECF, real-time changes in resting pHi and rates of pHi recovery were investigated during exposure to hypercapnia (3 and 6% CO2) in the absence and presence of additional acid loads induced by (20 mM) ammonium prepulse. During short-term (10 min) exposure to hypercapnia (3 and 6% CO2), sturgeon cells were acidified and no pHi compensation was observed. However, when exposure to 6% CO2 was extended to over 19 h, the CO2-induced intracellular acidosis was partially compensated by a pHi increase of over 0.2 pH unit despite the sustained extracellular acidosis, indicative of a capacity for preferential pHi regulation in vitro. Since this capacity in sturgeon liver is present both in vivo and in vitro, the transmembrane transporters involved may be the same. Therefore, cell culture may be a suitable tool to identify the transporters (i.e., the cellular mechanisms underlying in vivo CO2 tolerance) in white sturgeon and possibly in other hypercapnia-tolerant species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

West Indian Anolis lizards provide a classic example of an adaptive radiation, in which divergence has occurred along two primary ecological axes: structural microhabitat and climate. Adaptive plasticity in limb morphology is hypothesized to have facilitated divergence along the structural niche axis in Anolis, but very little work has explored plasticity in physiological traits. Here, we experimentally ask whether Puerto Rican Anolis cristatellus from mesic and xeric habitats differ in desiccation rates, and whether these lizards exhibit an acclimation response to changes in relative humidity. We first present microclimatic data collected at lizard perch sites that demonstrate that abiotic conditions experienced by lizards differ between mesic and xeric habitat types. In Experiment 1, we measured desiccation rates of lizards from both habitats maintained under identical laboratory conditions. This experiment demonstrated that desiccation rates differ between populations; xeric lizards lose water more slowly than mesic lizards. In Experiment 2, lizards from each habitat were either maintained under the conditions of Experiment 1, or under extremely low relative humidity. Desiccation rates did not differ between lizards from the same habitat maintained under different treatments and xeric lizards maintained lower desiccation rates than mesic lizards within each treatment. Our results demonstrate that A. cristatellus does not exhibit an acclimation response to abrupt changes of hydric conditions, and suggest that tropical Anolis lizards might be unable to exhibit physiological plasticity in desiccation rates in response to varying climatic conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In muscle and brain, the activity of GP remained constant throughout the year when tested at 25°C. In contrast, the activities of liver and heart GP displayed striking increases in summer. When seasonal temperature changes are taken into account, the activity of GP during the anoxic mid-winter is only 4–6% of its summer time activity in the muscle, heart and liver, and 13% in brain. In winter-acclimatized fish, experimental anoxia (1–6 weeks) caused sustained depression of the GP activity in heart and gills. In liver and muscle, a transient depression of GP activity occurred during the first week of anoxia but later GP activity recovered back to the normoxic level. GP of the brain was completely resistant to anoxia. In all studied tissues, the constitutive activity of GP is more than sufficient to degrade glycogen deposits during winter anoxia without anoxia-induced activation of GP. The seemingly paradoxical summer-time increase in the activity of liver and heart GP could be related to active life-style of the summer-acclimatized fish (growth, reproduction), the increased demand of energy and molecular precursors of anabolic metabolism being satisfied by preferential degradation of glycogen.

Goldfish hepatocytes treated with 1 mM AICAR under normoxic conditions (>200 μM O2) showed a modest but significant 1.1-fold increase in AMPK phosphorylation, a 7.5-fold increase in AMPK activity, a 1.4-fold increase in eEF2 phosphorylation, and a 24% decrease in $$ \dot{M}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }} $$. At physiologically relevant [O2] (<40 μM O2), the addition of 1 mM AICAR resulted in only a 13% decrease in cellular $$ \dot{M}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }} $$ with no change in sensitivity to [O2] as assessed by estimates of cellular P50 and P90 values. The addition of compound C, a general protein kinase inhibitor, after AICAR incubation did not reverse the effects of AICAR on $$ \dot{M}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }} $$ in normoxia. Treatment of hepatocytes with ≤200 μM A769662 did not affect AMPK activity, AMPK phosphorylation, eEF2 phosphorylation, or cellular $$ \dot{M}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }} $$. These data suggest that A769662 is not an activator of AMPK in goldfish hepatocytes.

This analysis includes study of electric organs and electric organ discharge (EOD) signals from 553 specimens collected from 12 localities in Gabon, West-Central Africa from 1998 to 2009. We measured time, slope, and voltage values from nine defined EOD “landmarks” and determined peak spectral frequencies from each waveform; these data were subjected to principal components analysis. The majority of variation in EODs is explained by two factors: the first related to EOD duration, the second related to the magnitude of the weak head-negative pre-potential, P0. Both factors varied clinally across Gabon. EODs are shorter in eastern Gabon and longer in western Gabon. Peak P0 is slightly larger in northern Gabon and smaller in southern Gabon. P0 in the EOD is due to the presence of penetrating-stalked (Pa) electrocytes in the electric organ while absence is due to the presence of non-penetrating stalked electrocytes (NPp). Across Gabon, the majority of P. kingsleyae populations surveyed have only individuals with P0-present EODs and Pa electrocytes. We discovered two geographically distinct populations, isolated from others by barriers to migration, where all individuals have P0-absent EODs with NPp electrocytes. At two sites along a boundary between P0-absent and P0-present populations, P0-absent and P0-present individuals were found in sympatry; specimens collected there had electric organs of intermediate morphology. This pattern of geographic variation in EODs is considered in the context of current phylogenetic work. Multiple independent paedomorphic losses of penetrating stalked electrocytes have occurred within five Paramormyrops species and seven genera of mormyrids. We suggest that this key anatomical feature in EOD signal evolution may be under a simple mechanism of genetic control, and may be easily influenced by selection or drift throughout the evolutionary history of mormyrids.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

From 1955 to 1962, he studied biology, chemistry, biochemistry and physics at the universities of Tübingen and Munich. For his doctoral dissertation, he investigated the anatomy and physiology of the visual system, and especially the eye, in the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus). He also developed an interest in the behavior of these large nonecholocating bats. This work was supervised by Franz Möhres, head of the Tübingen animal physiology department at the time. In 1962, Gerhard Neuweiler was awarded the doctoral degree (Dr. rer. nat.) with distinction (summa cum laude). After his PhD, Gerhard Neuweiler moved to India for 2 years to study behavior and social interactions of flying foxes in the wild. For this time, he was a fellow of the government of India and of the German Academic Exchange Service. Gerhard Neuweiler used these Indian years to get deeply familiar with the fauna and flora, but also the art, the religion and the people of his guest country. Throughout his scientific career, he kept research contacts with India and Sri Lanka and returned many times. In 1986, Neuweiler was awarded an honorary professorship at the Department of Animal Behaviour and Neurobiology at Madurai University. Later, he was nominated Honorary Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences Bangalore and Distinguished Fellow of Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research in Bangalore. It was also in India that Neuweiler and Indian colleagues performed an early comparative study on bat audition, published in the present journal (Neuweiler et al. 1984). This might have marked the onset of Neuweiler’s interest in the adaptation of bat echolocation systems to ecology; a topic on which he later published several influential review papers (Neuweiler 1989, 1990). And it was again in India and Sri Lanka where he gained important insights into echolocation behavior of free-ranging bats in the field (Habersetzer et al. 1984; Neuweiler et al. 1987). But first back to Germany. Gerhard Neuweiler returned from Madurai to Tübingen in 1964. He continued at the Department of Animal Physiology, first as an assistant professor (‘‘Wissenschaftlicher Assistent’’, 1964–1970) and after his habilitation, in 1970, as an associate professor This special issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology is dedicated to the memory of the late Professor Dr. Gerhard Neuweiler and his legacy in bat echolocation research.

These signals are often considered rudimentary and are believed to enable only crude performance. However, the main argument supporting this belief, namely the click’s reported long duration, was recently shown to be an artifact. In fact, the sonar clicks of Rousettus bats are extremely short, ~50–100 μs, similar to dolphin vocalizations. Here, we present a comparison between the sonar systems of the ‘model species’ of laryngeal echolocation, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and that of lingual echolocation, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). We show experimentally that in tasks, such as accurate landing or detection of medium-sized objects, click-based echolocation enables performance similar to laryngeal echolocators. Further, we describe a sophisticated behavioral strategy for biosonar beam steering in clicking bats. Finally, theoretical analyses of the signal design—focusing on their autocorrelations and wideband ambiguity functions—predict that in some aspects, such as target ranging and Doppler-tolerance, click-based echolocation might outperform laryngeal echolocation. Therefore, we suggest that click-based echolocation in bats should be regarded as a viable echolocation strategy, which is in fact similar to the biosonar used by most echolocating animals, including whales and dolphins.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this study the presence and daily fluctuations of melatonin levels were investigated in hemolymph, retina and nervous system-related structures in the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris. Adult animals were maintained in captivity under natural photoperiod and killed at different times in a regular daily cycle. Levels of melatonin, serotonin (5-HT) and its acid metabolite (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, 5-HIAA) in the hemolymph, retina, optic lobe, and cerebral ganglion were assayed by HPLC. Melatonin content fluctuated rhythmically in the retina and hemolymph, peaking at night. In the retina, but not in the other neural tissues, the rhythm was opposite to that of 5-HT, which displayed basal levels at night. Also, 5-HIAA levels in the retina were higher during the night, supporting that rhythmic melatonin production could be linked to diurnal changes in 5-HT degradation. The high levels of melatonin found in the retina point to it as the major source of melatonin in octopus; in addition, a large variation of melatonin content was found in the optic lobe with maximal values at night. All these data suggest that melatonin might play a role in the transduction of the light–dark cycle information for adjustment of rhythmic physiological events in cephalopods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The data obtained were correlated with indices characterizing different aspects of these fluctuations. We found the best correlations with the index quantifying the average amplitude of the magnetic disturbance, and with an index that quantifies the average variability of the magnetic field on the day of release: stronger and more variable fluctuations lead to a counter-clockwise shift of the mean headings during the initial phase at the release site and the following departure phase, but not during the final homing phase leading to the loft. The steadiness of flight was not affected during the initial phase; however, during the later parts of the homing flight, stronger fluctuations, as well as higher variability in the magnetic field led to a marked decrease in steadiness. This continuing effect of magnetic fluctuations indicates that magnetic factors not only affect the beginning, but remain an integral part of the pigeons’ navigational processes during the entire homing flight.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, they do exist in meliponine bees (Apidae, Apinae, Meliponini), commonly known as stingless bees, which represent a group of important pollinators in tropical forests. Worker bees of several Neotropical meliponine species, especially in the genus Scaptotrigona Moure 1942, deposit pheromone paths on substrates between highly profitable resources and their nest. In contrast to past results and claims, we find that these pheromone paths are not an indispensable condition for successful recruitment but rather a means to increase the success of recruiters in persuading their nestmates to forage food at a particular location. Our results are relevant to a speciation theory in scent path-laying meliponine bees, such as Scaptotrigona. In addition, the finding that pheromone path-laying bees are able to recruit to food locations even across barriers such as large bodies of water affects tropical pollination ecology and theories on the evolution of resource communication in insect societies with a flying worker caste.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hence this study used the sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), an introduced aquarium fish in Taiwan, to reveal that the potential roles of NKCC and NKA in sailfin molly were correlated to fish survival rates upon salinity challenge. Higher levels of branchial NKCC were found in seawater (SW)-acclimated sailfin molly compared to freshwater (FW)-acclimated individuals. Transfer of the sailfin molly from SW to FW revealed that the expression of the NKCC and NKA proteins in the gills was retained over 7 days in order to maintain hypoosmoregulatory endurance. Meanwhile, their survival rates after transfer to SW varied with the duration of FW-exposure and decreased significantly when the SW-acclimated individuals were acclimated to FW for 21 days. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that in SW-acclimated sailfin molly, NKCC signals were expressed on the basolateral membrane of MR cells, whereas in FW-acclimated molly, they were expressed on the apical membrane. This study illustrated the correlation between the gradual reductions in expression of branchial NKCC and NKA (i.e., the hypoosmoregulatory endurance) and decreasing survival rates after hyperosmotic challenge in sailfin molly.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We measured heart rate and blood pressure in normoxic and hypoxic-incubated (10% O2) American alligator embryos (Alligator mississippiensis) at 70 and 90/95% of development. We hypothesized that hypoxic incubation would blunt embryonic alligators’ response to a reflex loop stimulated by phenylbiguanide (PBG), a 5-HT3 receptor agonist that stimulates vagal pulmonary C-fiber afferents. PBG injection caused a hypotensive bradycardia in 70 and 95% of development embryos (paired t tests, P < 0.05), a response similar to mammals breathing inspired air (all injections made through occlusive catheter in tertiary chorioallantoic membrane artery). Hypoxic incubation blunted the bradycardic response to PBG in embryos at 95% of development (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.01). We also demonstrated that the vagally mediated afferent limb of this reflex can be partially or completely blocked in ovo with a 5-HT3 receptor blockade using ondansetron hydrochloride dihydrate (OHD), with a ganglionic blockade using hexamethonium, or with a cholinergic blockade using atropine. Atropine eliminated the hypotensive and bradycardic responses to PBG, and OHD and hexamethonium significantly blunted these responses. This cardiovascular reflex mediated by the vagus was affected by hypoxic incubation, suggesting that reptilian sympathetic and parasympathetic reflex loops have the potential for developmental plasticity in response to hypoxia. We suggest that the American alligator, with an extended length of time between each developmental stage relative to avian species, may provide an excellent model to test the cardiorespiratory effects of prolonged exposure to changes in atmospheric gases. This extended period allows for lengthy studies at each stage without the transition to a new stage, and the natural occurrence of hypoxia and hypercapnia in crocodilian nests makes this stress ecologically and evolutionarily relevant.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In early (immature) migrants and pre-spawning females, muscle glycogen was markedly depleted during exercise, but became rapidly replenished. As muscle lactate rose during exercise and peaked 1–1.5 h into the recovery period, and therefore after muscle glycogen had become replenished, it cannot be the direct source for that replenishment. However, both plasma lactate and glycerol (but not muscle glycerol and glucose) rose sharply during exercise and then declined markedly during the first 0.5 h of recovery and thus exhibited the opposite trend to that of muscle glycogen, implying that these limited pools of glycogenic precursors contribute to glycogen replenishment. Although plasma glucose rose following exercise, and consequently could also be a precursor for muscle glycogen replenishment, it remained elevated even after muscle glycogen had become replenished. While resting pre-spawning females and mature males retained high muscle glycogen concentrations, this energy store became permanently depleted in females during spawning. In mature males, muscle glycogen remained high and lactate low during the exercise/recovery regime, whereas muscle glycerol declined precipitously during exercise and then rose rapidly. In summary, vigorous activity by G. australis is fuelled extensively by anaerobic metabolism of glycogen early in the spawning run and by pre-spawning females, but by aerobic metabolism of its energy reserves in mature males.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Next to nothing is known about their regulation, function or stress-responsiveness in poikilotherms. Here, both acute heat stress and thermal acclimation were demonstrated to induce the expression of one isoform, C/EBP-δ, in the liver, white muscle and gill of the eurythermal estuarine goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. The established role of C/EBP-δ in causing cell cycle arrest and/or promoting apoptosis in other vertebrates suggests that the heat-inducibility of this protein in poikilotherms may be part of the conserved cellular stress response with the hypothesized role of causing temporary cessation of cell growth and/or programmed cell death during bouts of environmental stress.

Uptake of l-alanine and glycine conformed to Michaelis–Menten kinetics. An uptake affinity (Km; substrate concentration required to attain a 50% uptake saturation) of 7.0 mM and an uptake capacity (Jmax) of 83 nmol cm−2 h−1 were described for l-alanine. The Km and Jmax for glycine were 2.2 mM and 11.9 nmol cm−2 h−1, respectively. Evidence suggested that the pathways of l-alanine and glycine absorption were shared, and sodium dependent. Further analysis indicated that glycine uptake was independent of luminal pH and proline, but a component of uptake was significantly impaired by 100-fold excesses of threonine or asparagine. The presence of a short-term (24 h) exposure to waterborne glycine, similar in nature to that which may be expected to occur when feeding inside an animal carcass, had no significant impact on gastrointestinal glycine uptake. This may indicate a lack of cross talk between absorptive epithelia.

To determine if blind cavefish have evolved behavioral specializations for active flow-sensing, including the ability to regulate flow signal production through lateral line feedback, the swimming kinematics of blind and sighted morphs of Astyanax were compared before and after 24 h of familiarization with a novel, dark environment and with and without lateral line functionality. Although both morphs showed little difference in the vast majority of kinematic parameters measured, blind morphs differed significantly from sighted morphs in having a much higher incidence of swim cycle sequences devoid of sharp turns. Both lateral line deprivation and familiarization with the arena led to significant declines in this number for blind, but not sighted morphs. These findings suggest that swimming kinematics are largely conserved, but that blind morphs have nevertheless evolved enhanced abilities to use lateral line feedback when linking swim cycles into continuous, straight trajectories for exploratory purposes. This behavioral specialization can best be understood in terms of the intermittent and short-range limitations of active flow-sensing and the challenges they pose for spatial orientation and navigation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Accordingly, DIF mutants have been reported to have a lower resistance to fungi than control flies. However, as the longevity of non-infected DIF flies has not been measured in previous studies, it could be that survival times after infection are constrained by a low longevity. In the present study, DIF flies reared in conditions similar to those used in these previous studies had much lower survival time after infection than the control flies, but the longevity of non-infected DIF flies was also very low. Using rearing conditions controlling larval crowding, age of parents and mating status of experimental flies increased longevity of non-infected flies and survival time after infection in both strains.

We previously showed in euryhaline fish that salinity impacts the relative contribution of the two pathways for PC biosynthesis, with PEMT pathway being activated in the liver of sea water (SW)-adapted animals. To address the occurrence of such phenomenon in other animals we performed in vivo metabolic studies in two crustacean species: the Chinese crab (Eriocheir sinensis) and the green crab (Carcinus maenas). In both species, the levels of PC and phosphatidylethanolamine in hepatopancreas and hemolymph were not modified by SW-adaptation. In E. sinensis, SW-adaptation activated PC labeling from l-(U-14C)-serine in the hepatopancreas and resulted in an increased ratio of PC specific activities between hemolymph and hepatopancreas. In C. maenas, incorporation of l-(3-3H)-serine and l-(2-14C)-ethanolamine into PC of hepatopancreas was strongly inhibited after acclimation to fresh water (FW). The results show that PC synthesis via the PEMT pathway and its subsequent release into hemolymph are both activated in SW- compared to FW-adapted animals. SW-adaptation also resulted in increased tissue concentrations of betaine and labeling from l-(U-14C)-serine, suggesting that the PEMT-derived PC is used for the synthesis of organic osmolytes.

Here, we hypothesize that an increase in oxidative stress accounts for the detrimental effects of prolonged high secretion of glucocorticoids. We performed a meta-analysis on studies where physiological stress was induced by administration of glucocorticoids to evaluate the magnitude of their effects on oxidative stress. Glucocorticoids have a significant effect on oxidative stress (Pearson r = 0.552), although this effect depends on the duration of treatment, and is larger in long-term experiments. Importantly, there was a significant effect on tissue, with brain and heart being the most and the least susceptible to GC-induced oxidative stress, respectively. Furthermore, effect size was larger (1) in studies using both sexes compared to males only, (2) when corticosterone rather than dexamethasone was administered and (3) in juveniles than in adults. These effects were not confounded by species, biochemical biomarker, or whether wild or laboratory animals were studied. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that GC-induced oxidative stress could be a further mechanism underlying increases in disease susceptibility and decreases in Darwinian fitness observed under chronic stress.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Two data sets from the current literature are re-examined here to illustrate instances in which log transformation caused ugly data to look deceptively good. One of the investigations focused on the scaling of metabolism to body mass in evolutionary transitions from prokaryotic to protistan to metazoan levels of organization whereas the other addressed the scaling of intestines to body size in rodents. In both instances investigators were led to conclusions that are not supported by the original data.

In untreated controls, anti-nv-TRPA1a primarily labels the base of the hair bundle with some labeling also distributed along the length of stereocilia. Tissue immunolabeled in the presence of the antigenic peptide exhibits reduced labeling. Activating chemoreceptors for N-acetylated sugars induce immunolabel to distribute distally in stereocilia. In anemones, activating chemoreceptors for N-acetylated sugars induce hair bundles to elongate among several other structural and functional changes. Taken together, these results are consistent with the possibility that nv-TRPA1a participates in signal transduction of anemone hair bundles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Freezing challenges living organisms in many ways, with ice formation in the body producing a suite of physical and metabolic stresses which can damage cells and tissues. The present study looked at two mechanisms that address some of these stresses: cryoprotectants and ice nucleating agents (INAs). Skin secretions from L. ewingii were sampled along with microhabitat substrate and tested for the presence of INAs, which help control ice formation in the body. L. ewingii plasma was tested for seasonal and freezing-induced changes in both glucose and glycerol, which may have a cryoprotective role in freezing-tolerant frogs. Glycerol levels increased on freezing and decreased on thawing, while glucose levels did not change on freezing but increased on thawing. This suggests that glycerol may be acting as a cryoprotectant, although levels are low compared to other frogs. A clear seasonal change was seen in INA activity, with greater activity in winter than in summer. While potent INAs came from the microhabitat substrate, this work has shown for the first time that skin secretions also contain active INAs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, the role of maternal leptin in the development of wild rodent offspring is not clear. We tested the hypothesis that maternal hyperleptinemia in lactating Brandt’s voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) can protect their offspring from the risks of high-fat-diet-induced-obesity and insulin resistance. Lactating voles were supplemented with murine leptin (0.64 μg g−1 day−1) or phosphate-buffered saline (control) on days10–17 of lactation (peak lactation). At 12 weeks of age, the female and male offspring of the two maternal groups were randomly assigned to two groups each and fed either a high-fat diet (41% of gross energy as fat) or a control diet (14% of gross energy as fat) until the age of 23 weeks. Body mass, food intake, glucose tolerance and resting metabolic rate were determined in the four offspring groups. After animals were sacrificed, organ masses and adipose tissue distribution, and serum leptin and insulin concentrations were measured. Offspring of leptin-treated mothers showed no significant differences in body mass, energy intake or energy expenditure, body composition, glucose tolerance or serum leptin and insulin concentrations from offspring of control mothers. The high-fat diet induced increases in body mass (by 23% in female and 17% in male offspring) and reduced glucose tolerance in both female and male offspring, indicative of the emergence of insulin resistance, even though digestible energy intake of the male offspring decreased on the high-fat diet. These results indicate that maternal hyperleptinemia during peak lactation in Brandt’s voles did not protect against diet-induced obesity or glucose intolerance in their offspring.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Cane toads were exposed to 10 days of CH (10% O2) or CHC (3.5% CO2) followed by acute in vivo hypercapnic breathing trials, conducted before and after an injection of the NMDA-receptor channel blocker, MK801 into the dorsal lymph sac. CH, CHC and MK801 did not alter ventilation under acute normoxic normocapnic conditions. CH blunted the increase in breathing frequency during acute hypercapnia while CHC had no effect. The effect of CH on breathing frequency was mediated by a decrease in the number of breaths per breathing episode. Neither CH nor CHC altered breath area (volume). MK801 augmented breathing frequency (via an increase in breaths per episode) and total ventilation during acute hypercapnia in control toads and toads exposed to CH; there was no effect of MK801 on the increase in breathing frequency or total ventilation, during acute hypercapnia in toads exposed to CHC. The results indicate that CH and CHC differentially alter breathing pattern. Furthermore, they indicate an absence of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic tone during normoxic normocapnia but that NMDA-mediated processes attenuate the increase in breathing frequency during acute hypercapnia under control conditions and following CH but not following CHC. Given that MK801 was administered systemically, the effects could be acting anywhere in the reflex pathway from CO2-sensing to respiratory motor output.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the present study, we have examined the role of the Drosophila atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGCs), Gyc-89Da and Gyc-89Db, in larval and adult gustatory preference behaviors. We showed that in larvae, sucrose attraction requires Gyc-89Db and caffeine avoidance requires Gyc-89Da. In adult flies, sucrose attraction is unaffected by mutations in either gene whereas avoidance of low concentrations of caffeine is eliminated by loss of either gene. Similar defective behaviors were observed when cGMP increases were prevented by the expression of a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase. We also showed that both genes were expressed in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in larval and adult gustatory organs, primarily in a non-overlapping pattern, with the exception of a small group of cells in the adult labellum. In addition, in adults, several cells co-expressed the bitter taste receptor, Gr66a, with either Gyc-89Da or Gyc-89Db. We also showed that the electrophysiological responses of a GRN to caffeine were significantly reduced in flies mutant for the atypical sGCs, suggesting that at least part of the adult behavioral defects were due to a reduced ability to detect caffeine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Ornamental colors have long been studied as honest signals of condition, but few studies have been conducted on how the physiological stress response (i.e., corticosterone (CORT) elevation) impacts color expression. We used a traditional capture-and-restraint technique to examine the effect of repeated handling stress on carotenoid-dependent beak coloration in male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Birds subjected to daily, 10-min handling treatments, which elevated circulating CORT levels, for a four-week period displayed deeper orange/red beak coloration than did control animals. Stressed males lost body mass during the experiment and marginally decreased in circulating carotenoid concentrations. Hence, handling stress may have reduced food intake or induced mobilization of body stores (i.e., fat) of carotenoids. In contrast to males, stressed females maintained orange beak color, while control females faded in color. This study highlights sex- and pigment-specific mechanisms by which stress may temporarily enhance the expression of sexual traits, but at the expense of other key fitness traits (e.g., body mass maintenance, reproduction).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The males of many species have in restricted areas of the wing upper sides a distinct structural colouration, which is created by stacks of lamellae in the ridges of the wing scales, resulting in iridescence. The amplitude of the reflectance is proportional to the number of lamellae in the ridge stacks. The angle-dependent peak wavelength of the observed iridescence is in agreement with classical multilayer theory. The iridescence is virtually always in the ultraviolet wavelength range, but some species have a blue-peaking iridescence.

However, no studies have assessed whether the activities of digestive enzymes of the enterocytes correlate with dietary chemical composition data analyzed as a continuous variable at an evolutionary scale. We used a phylogenetically explicit approach to examine the effect of diet on the hydrolytic activity of three digestive enzymes (maltase, sucrase, and aminopeptidase-N) in 16 species of songbirds (Order Passeriformes) from Central Chile. The total activities (μmol/min) of these enzymes were positively associated with body mass using both conventional least squares regressions and phylogenetically independent contrasts. After removing mass effects, we found a significant negative correlation between the ratio of aminopeptidase-N and maltase to the proportion of seeds found in the gizzard, but this relationship was no longer significant after controlling for phylogeny. When we analyzed the specific nutritional content of the diet, we found that the percentage of nitrogen in diet was negatively correlated with residual maltase activity and positively correlated with the ratio aminopeptidase-N/maltase. Given the large interspecific differences in biochemical capacity, we conclude that these differences reflect genetically determined evolutionary changes associated with the nutrient contents of each species’ natural diet.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

For 5 weeks prior to fasting, quail were fed a standard diet and gavaged each morning with 0.7 ml of water (control), or a vegetable oil comprising saturated fatty acids (SFA; coconut oil), or unsaturated fatty acids (UFA; canola oil). Birds were then fasted for 4 days at a Ta of 15°C. We found that, while fasting, both photophase and scotophase Tb decreased significantly more in the SFA treatment group than in the control group; apparently the former down-regulated their Tb set point. This deeper hypothermic response was correlated with changes in the phospholipid composition of the skeletal muscle and liver, which contained significantly more oleic acid (18:1) and less arachidonic acid (20:4), respectively.

Mean crude fat content in hare stomachs and total gastrointestinal (GI) tracts was higher than expected for typical herbivore forages and peaked in late fall when hares massively deposited body fat reserves. Changes of FA proportions in different parts of the GI-tract indicated a highly preferential absorption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). A further reduction of PUFA content in the caecum, along with the appearance of odd-chained FAs in caecum, caecotrophes, and colon content, pointed to a biohydrogenation of PUFA in the hare’s hindgut. GI-tract contents showed significant seasonal changes in their FA composition. Among PUFA, α-linolenic acid peaked in spring while linoleic acid was predominant in late summer and fall, which probably reflected changes in the plant composition of forage. However, independent of seasonal changes, GI-tracts of lactating females showed a significantly (+33%) higher content of linoleic acid, a FA that is known to increase reproductive performance in European hares. This finding suggests that lactating females actively selected dietary plants rich in linoleic acid, a PUFA that may represent a limited resource for European hares.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The distribution of H. cumberlandicus is much broader than the range of H. opilionoides, which is much smaller in body size, and that of H. jonesi, which possesses enhanced troglomorphic (cave dwelling) characteristics. Due to high net transpiration (water loss) rates and increased activation energies, H. jonesi and H. opilionoides are more susceptible to dehydration than H. cumberlandicus. To avoid dehydration, H. opilionoides and H. jonesi require more moisture than H. cumberlandicus to counter their higher rates of water loss. The heightened reliance on moisture likely indicates that the more troglomorphic H. jonesi and smaller H. opilionoides are required to spend more time in the moist cave region. Reliance on the cave for H. cumberlandicus is presumably less, allowing them to function in epigean habitats for longer periods and disperse to nearby caves, likely accounting for the more expansive distribution of this cricket. While in the cave habitat, cave crickets are exposed to water-saturated conditions, reducing the pressure of dehydration stress the longer a species remains in this wet environment. This reduced pressure leads to higher water loss rates as cave confinement increases. We conclude that increasing water loss rates associated with increasing troglomorphic adaptation in cave crickets is a side effect of extended residence in stable moist cave environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Three females and their six pups were isolated from our captive breeding colony. We recorded vocal activity from postnatal day 1 to 35, both when the pups were isolated and when they were reunited with their mothers. At birth, pups exclusively emitted isolation calls, with a fundamental frequency range <20 kHz, and duration >30 ms. By the middle of week 1, different types of vocalizations began to emerge. Starting in week 2, pups in the presence of their mothers emitted sounds that resembled adult communication vocalizations, with a lower frequency range and longer durations than isolation calls or echolocation signals. During weeks 2 and 3, these vocalizations were extremely heterogeneous, suggesting that the pups went through a babbling stage before establishing a repertoire of stereotyped adult vocalizations around week 4. By week 4, vocalizations emitted when pups were alone were identical to adult echolocation signals. Echolocation and communication signals both appear to develop from the isolation call, diverging during week 2 and continuing to develop at different rates for several weeks until the adult vocal repertoire is established.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We measured circulating testosterone and cortisol concentrations in plasma samples taken from parental males following a simulated nest intrusion by a common nest predator, the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). To understand whether endocrine regulation changes across the parental care period, we looked both at males guarding fresh eggs and at males guarding hatched embryos. Plasma testosterone levels increased in males subjected to a simulated nest intrusion when compared to sham controls. Testosterone concentrations in males guarding embryos were lower than in males guarding fresh eggs, but circulating testosterone was positively correlated with the level of aggression towards the nest predator at both offspring development stages. However, there was no increase in cortisol levels following a simulated nest intrusion, and no relationship between cortisol and any measured parameter.

The frequencies of these low–high-note pairs remain stable within sequences. In Panama, we recorded echolocation calls from S. bilineata with a multi-microphone array at two sites: one a known roosting site, the other a known foraging site. Our results indicate that this species (1) only produces monotonous sequences in non-foraging contexts and, at times, directly after emitting a feeding buzz and (2) produces frequency-alternating sequences when actively foraging. These latter sequences are also characterized by an unusual, offbeat emission rhythm. We found significant positive relationships between (1) call intensity and call duration and (2) call intensity and distance from clutter.

(Respir Physiol 112:123–134, 1998) described and defined the time domains of the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in adult mammals. These time domains, however, have yet to receive much attention in other vertebrate groups. The initial, acute HVR of fish, amphibians and reptiles serves to minimize the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand. If the hypoxia is sustained, a suite of secondary adjustments occur giving rise to a more long-term balance (acclimatization) that allows the behaviors of normal life. These secondary responses can change over time as a function of the nature of the stimulus (the pattern and intensity of the hypoxic exposure). To add to the complexity of this process, hypoxia can also lead to metabolic suppression (the hypoxic metabolic response) and the magnitude of this is also time dependent. Unlike the original review of Powell et al. (Respir Physiol 112:123–134, 1998) that only considered the HVR in adult animals, we also consider relevant developmental time points where information is available. Finally, in amphibians and reptiles with incompletely divided hearts the magnitude of the ventilatory response will be modulated by hypoxia-induced changes in intra-cardiac shunting that also improve the match between O2 supply and demand, and these too change in a time-dependent fashion. While the current literature on this topic is reviewed here, it is noted that this area has received little attention. We attempt to redefine time domains in a more ‘holistic’ fashion that better accommodates research on ectotherms. If we are to distinguish between the genetic, developmental and environmental influences underlying the various ventilatory responses to hypoxia, however, we must design future experiments with time domains in mind.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Duration-tuned neurons (DTNs) have since been reported from the central auditory system of both echolocating and non-echolocating mammals, and from the central visual system of cats. We hypothesize that the functional significance of auditory duration tuning likely varies between species with different evolutionary histories, sensory ecologies, and bioacoustic constraints. For example, in non-echolocating animals such as frogs and mice the temporal filtering properties of auditory DTNs may function to discriminate species-specific communication sounds. In echolocating bats duration tuning may also be used to create cells with highly selective responses for specific rates of frequency modulation and/or pulse-echo delays. The ability to echolocate appears to have selected for high temporal acuity in the duration tuning curves of inferior colliculus neurons in bats. Our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sound duration selectivity has improved substantially since DTNs were first discovered almost 50 years ago, but additional research is required for a comprehensive understanding of the functional role and the behavioral significance that duration tuning plays in sensory systems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We found that the ultrasound-only call elicited egr-1 expression in the superior olivary and principal nucleus of the torus semicircularis. In sampled areas of the principal nucleus, the ultrasound-only call tended to evoke higher egr-1 expression than the full-spectrum call and, in the center of the nucleus, induced significantly higher egr-1 levels than the no-sound control. In the superior olivary nucleus, the full-spectrum and ultrasound-only calls evoked similar levels of expression that were significantly greater than the control, and egr-1 induction in the laminar nucleus showed no evidence of acoustic modulation.

However, relatively few of these antifreeze molecules have been chemically characterized. We screened diverse species by subjecting their homogenates to ice-affinity purification and discovered the presence of a newly identified class of antifreeze, a xylomannan-based TH-producing glycolipid that was previously reported in one species of freeze-tolerant Alaskan beetle. We isolated xylomannan-based antifreeze glycolipids from one plant species, six insect species, and the first frog species to be shown to produce a large-molecular-mass antifreeze. 1H NMR spectra of the ice-purified molecules isolated from these diverse freeze-tolerant and freeze-avoiding organisms were nearly identical, indicating that the chemical structures of the glycolipids were highly similar. Although the exact functions remain uncertain, it appears that antifreeze glycolipids play a role in cold tolerance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A detailed time course sampling of gastrointestinal (GI) tract contents following the ingestion of a single meal of a commercial diet revealed the assimilation of both water and dietary ions (Na+, Cl−, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) along the GI tract of seawater-acclimated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) which had been fasted for 1 week. Consumption of the meal did not change the drinking rate. There was a large secretion of fluid into the anterior intestine and caecae (presumably bile and/or pancreatic secretions). As a result, net assimilation (63%) of the ingested water along the GI tract was lower than generally reported for fasted trout. Mg2+ was neither secreted into nor absorbed from the GI tract on a net basis. Only K+ (93% assimilated) and Ca2+ (43% assimilated) were absorbed in amounts in excess of those provided by ingested seawater, suggesting that dietary sources of K+ and Ca2+ may be important to seawater teleosts. The oesophagus–stomach served as a major site of absorption for Na+, Cl−, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, and the anterior intestine and caecae as a major site of net secretion for all of these ions, except Cl−. Despite large absorptive fluxes of these ions, the ionic composition of the plasma was maintained during the digestion of the meal. The results of the present study were compared with previous work on freshwater-acclimated rainbow trout, highlighting some important differences, but also several similarities on the assimilation of water and ions along the gastrointestinal tract during digestion. This study highlights the complicated array of ion and water transport that occurs in the intestine during digestion while revealing the importance of dietary K+ and Ca2+ to seawater-acclimated rainbow trout. Additionally, this study reveals that digestion in seawater-acclimated rainbow trout appears to compromise intestinal water absorption.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A longer measurement duration reduced values for all variables for all start times, and this was an effect of reduced animal activity rather than random sampling. However, there was also an effect of circadian rhythm on the timing of minimal physiological values. Experiment start time had a significant effect on time taken to reach minimal values for all variables, ranging from 0400 hours ± 38 min (body temperature, start time 2300 hours) to 0854 hours ± 52 min (evaporative water loss, start time 1700 hours). It also influenced the time of day that minimal values were obtained, ranging from 2224 hours ± 40 min (carbon dioxide production, start time 1500 hours) to 0600 hours ± 57 min (oxygen consumption, start time 2300 hours), and the minimum values measured. Consequently, both the measurement duration and the experiment start time should be considered in experimental design to account for both a handling and a circadian effect on the animal’s physiology. We suggest that experiments to measure standard physiological variables for small diurnal birds should commence between 1700 and 2100 hours, and measurement duration should be at least 9 h.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We hypothesized that healthy bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) 30 years and older may demonstrate similar clinicopathological changes with increasing age. Retrospective hematological and serum chemistry data generated from routine, fasted blood samples collected over 10 to 20 years among six healthy dolphins that lived at least 40 years were analyzed to (1) assess linear trends in blood variable values with increasing age, (2) compare mean blood values by older age categories (30–35 years, 36–40 years, and >40 years), and (3) compare the prevalence of clinically high or low blood values by older age categories. Absolute lymphocytes, serum globulins, and mean platelet volume increased linearly with increasing old age. Mean white blood cells, neutrophils, serum globulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, serum cholesterol, and serum triglycerides; and the prevalence of neutrophilic leukocytosis, hyperglobulinemia, and hypercholesterolemia, were more likely to be higher as geriatric dolphins got older. A linear decrease in serum albumin with increasing age was present for five of six animals. Serum creatinine decreased among dolphins older than 40 years compared to when they were 30–40 years old. Our study demonstrates that older dolphins have changes in hematological and serum chemistry values similar to those found in older humans. As such, bottlenose dolphins may serve as a useful comparative model for aging in humans. Further studies are needed to assess whether these changes are associated with negative health outcomes and whether targeted therapeutics can help improve quality of life among aging dolphins.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This requires ORNs to have a [Cl−]i above the electrochemical equilibrium to render this anionic current excitatory. In mammalian ORNs, the Na+-K+-2Cl− co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) has been characterized as the principal mechanism by which these neurons actively accumulate Cl−. To determine if NKCC activity is needed in amphibian olfactory transduction, and to characterize its cellular location, we used the suction pipette technique to record from Rana pipiens ORNs. Application of bumetanide, an NKCC blocker, produced a 50% decrease of the odorant-induced current. Similar effects were observed when [Cl−]i was decreased by bathing ORNs in low Cl− solution. Both manipulations reduced only the Cl− component of the current. Application of bumetanide only to the ORN cell body and not to the cilia decreased the current by again about 50%. The results show that NKCC is required for amphibian olfactory transduction, and suggest that the co-transporter is located basolaterally at the cell body although its presence at the cilia could not be discarded.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This versatile time-memory, based on an endogenous circadian clock, presumably enables foragers to schedule their reconnaissance flights to best take advantage of the daily rhythms of nectar and pollen availability in different species of flowers. It is commonly believed that the time-memory rapidly extinguishes if not reinforced daily, thus enabling foragers to switch quickly from relatively poor sources to more productive ones. On the other hand, it is also commonly thought that extinction of the time-memory is slow enough to permit foragers to ‘remember’ the food source over a day or two of bad weather. What exactly is the time-course of time-memory extinction? In a series of field experiments, we determined that the level of food-anticipatory activity (FAA) directed at a food source is not rapidly extinguished and, furthermore, the time-course of extinction is dependent upon the amount of experience accumulated by the forager at that source. We also found that FAA is prolonged in response to inclement weather, indicating that time-memory extinction is not a simple decay function but is responsive to environmental changes. These results provide insights into the adaptability of FAA under natural conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, were trained to discriminate a smooth 16 mm diameter object (S+) from a size-matched textured object (S−), both of which were tethered in random locations in a flight room. The bat’s three-dimensional flight path was reconstructed using stereo images from high-speed video recordings, and the bat’s sonar vocalizations were recorded for each trial and analyzed off-line. A microphone array permitted reconstruction of the sonar beam pattern, allowing us to study the bat’s directional gaze and inspection of the objects. Bats learned the discrimination, but performance varied with S−. In acoustic studies of the objects, the S+ and S− stimuli were ensonified with frequency-modulated sonar pulses. Mean intensity differences between S+ and S− were within 4 dB. Performance data, combined with analyses of echo recordings, suggest that the big brown bat listens to changes in sound spectra from echo to echo to discriminate between objects. Bats adapted their sonar calls as they inspected the stimuli, and their sonar behavior resembled that of animals foraging for insects. Analysis of sonar beam-directing behavior in certain trials clearly showed that the bat sequentially inspected S+ and S−.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We also show that saccular sensitivity to frequencies greater than 385 Hz increases with age/size and that the midshipman saccule of small and large juveniles, like that of non-reproductive adults, is best suited to detect low frequency sounds (<105 Hz) in their natural acoustic environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested whether oxytocin and an oxytocin receptor antagonist affect the transfer of food to offspirng by fathers. After intracerebroventricular infusion of the vehicle, oxytocin, or the oxytocin receptor antagonist, the fathers’ behavior, including picking up food, transferring food to the offspring, and refusing to transfer food to the offspring, was analyzed.

The peripheral auditory system, for example, performs a spectral decomposition of sound that should result in a tradeoff between frequency resolution and temporal resolution. We assessed temporal resolution in three songbird species using auditory brainstem responses to paired click stimuli. Temporal resolution was greater in house sparrows (Passer domesticus) than Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) and white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), as predicted based on previous observations of broader auditory filters (lower frequency resolution) in house sparrows. Furthermore, within chickadees, individuals with broader auditory filters had greater temporal resolution. In contrast to predictions however, temporal resolution was similar between chickadees and nuthatches despite broader auditory filters in chickadees. These results and the results of a model simulation exploring the effect of broadened auditory filter bandwidth on temporal resolution in the auditory periphery strongly suggest that frequency resolution constrains temporal resolution in songbirds. Furthermore, our results suggest that songbirds have greater temporal resolution than some mammals, in agreement with recent behavioral studies.

Newly emerged individuals remain inside the nest, without contact with the external environment. Maturing workers go to more peripheral regions and only the oldest, the foragers, leave the nest. As this diversity of activities implies different metabolic patterns, oxygen consumption has been measured in workers of three different ages: 24–48 h (nurses), 10–15 days (builders), and older than 25 days (foragers). Oxygen consumption of individually isolated workers was determined by intermittent respirometry, under constant darkness and temperature of 25 ± 1°C. Sets of 24-h measurements were obtained from individuals belonging to each of the three worker groups. Rhythmicity has been assessed in the daily (24 h) and ultradian (5–14 h) domains. This experimental design allowed detection of endogenous rhythms without the influence of the social group and without inflicting stress on the individuals, as would be caused by their longer isolation from the colony. Significant 24-h rhythms in oxygen consumption were present in nurses, builders and foragers; therefore, workers are rhythmic from the age of 24–48 h. However, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm changed according to age: nurses showed the lowest values, while foragers consistently presented the largest ones, about ten times larger than the amplitude of nurses’ respiratory rhythm. Ultradian frequencies were detected for all worker groups, the power and frequencies of which varied little with age.

The absence of a stomach does not restrict trophic preference, resulting in fishes with very similar alimentary morphology capable of digesting differing diets. We examined the digestive biochemistry of four beloniform fishes: two herbivorous halfbeaks (Hemiramphidae) and two carnivorous needlefish (Belonidae) to determine how these fishes digest their respective diets with their simple, short gut. We found that although the halfbeaks showed significantly greater α-amylase activity than that of the needlefish (P < 0.01), trypsin, lipase, aminopeptidase and maltase activity were not substantially different between the two families.

Volume fraction of elastin, density of vasa vasorum and innervations was estimated by stereology. Immunohistological staining with S100 was used to examine the innervation. The pressure increase in the artery and vein along the foreleg was not significantly different from what was expected on basis of gravity. The area of the arterial lumen in the hindleg decreased towards the hoof from 11.2 ± 4.2 to 0.6 ± 0.5 mm2 (n = 10, P = 0.001), but most of this narrowing occurred within 2–4 cm immediately below the knee.

The narrowing had a six-fold higher innervation density than the immediate distal and proximal regions.

Between interbout euthermia (body temperature, Tb, 37°C) and early entrance (Tb 30°C), state 3 and state 4 respirations, fueled by 6 mM succinate, fell by over 50%. Mitochondrial respiration did not decline any further in the late entrance and torpor stages (Tb 15 and 5°C, respectively). Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity declined in a similar pattern as mitochondrial respiration, and there was a significant positive correlation between state 3 respiration and SDH activity. However, unlike during arousal from torpor, oxaloacetate was not a major factor in inhibition of SDH. Analysis of mitochondrial lipids showed little change in neutral lipids or phospholipid classes, except for a transient decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine content in early entrance. In the transition from interbout euthermia to early entrance, we found transient increases in some saturated phospholipid fatty acids (16:0, 18:0) and decreases in some unsaturates (18:2, 20:4). These changes resulted in transient increases in total saturates and the ratio of saturates to unsaturates, and transient decreases in total unsaturates, total polyunsaturates, total n-6, the ratio of monounsaturates to polyunsaturates, and unsaturation index. None of these changes persisted into late entrance or torpor, nor did they correlate with mitochondrial respiration.

While innate immunity offers initial protection from a variety of pathogens, acquired immunity responds more specifically to pathogens, but is considered to be more costly and to respond slower. Moreover, the acquired immunity is not yet fully developed in neonatal chicks. Little is known about the ontogeny of the immune system of wild birds. Long-lived seabirds, with their slow chick development, are good models to investigate how young birds invest in both arms of their immune system. We determined leucocyte profiles and heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratios of Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaeton rubricauda westralis) on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Young chicks (N = 10) had significantly higher H/L ratios than older chicks (N = 19), while adults (N = 47) showed intermediate values and did not differ from either chick age class. High H/L ratios in young chicks were caused by high initial numbers of heterophils per 10,000 erythrocytes that declined with age. In contrast, the number of lymphocytes per 10,000 erythrocytes was similar for young and older chicks. These data suggest that young chicks invested heavily in innate immunity to protect themselves from pathogens, while investment into acquired immunity became more important in older chicks with a functional acquired immune response.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) possess two non-allelic TH coding genes, TH1 and TH2. A principal goal of the present study was to determine if the expression of these genes is sensitive to environmental hypoxia. Additionally, we sought to determine if catecholamine content of larvae was changed by environmental hypoxia, and whether the hearts of hypoxic larvae were equally responsive to exogenous catecholamine (norepinephrine) exposure. After 2 days of exposure to hypoxia [5–7 days post-fertilization (dpf); PO2 = 30 Torr] TH2 mRNA expression was significantly lower and dopamine β hydroxylase (DβH) mRNA was significantly higher in whole larvae. Whole body catecholamine levels were unchanged until after 4 days of hypoxic exposure (5–9 dpf), at which time there was a significant increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine contents. Norepinephrine content was significantly elevated in the hearts of adult fish after 2 and 4 days of hypoxic exposure, and TH1 mRNA expression was increased in the kidney of both groups. After 2 or 4 days of exposure to hypoxia, larvae displayed significantly lower heart rates than normoxic fish. However, application of exogenous norepinephrine caused similar increases in heart rate in both groups. Overall, it is concluded that the mRNA expression of TH1 and TH2 is differentially affected by hypoxia exposure in larvae and adults. Also, catecholamine biosynthesis appears to be activated by 2 dpf and although whole body catecholamine levels increase during hypoxia (possibly promoting downregulation of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors), there is no accompanying decrease in the response of the heart to adrenergic stimulation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This species has also been noted to touch obstacles, mainly with the pectoral fins, apparently using this tactile information alongside hydrodynamic imaging to sense their surroundings. This study aimed to determine the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and tactile information during wall following behaviour in blind Mexican cave fish. A wall was custom built with a ‘netted’ region in its centre, which provided very similar tactile information to a solid tank wall, but was undetectable using hydrodynamic imaging. The fish swam significantly closer to and collided more frequently with the netted region of this wall than the solid regions, indicating that the fish did not perceive the netted region as a solid obstacle despite being able to feel it as such with their pectoral fins.

Carotenoids must be acquired through diet and are relatively scarce, suggesting that their availability is a limiting factor leading to a trade-off between colour displays and physiological functions. However, potential differences in this trade-off between male and female chicks have been little studied. We manipulated carotenoid availability in 9 days old common tern Sterna hirundo chicks by supplementing their fish diet with four carotenoids during 9 days. Our aim was to examine sex-specific responses to the experimental increase of dietary carotenoids on plasma circulation, physiological and condition variables and successful fledging. Furthermore, to explore the functional and evolutionary basis of the trade-off, we studied the relationships among carotenoid concentration, mediated immune response and foot colouration. After treatment, control chicks showed decreasing plasma levels for most carotenoid types, whereas supplemented chicks had strong increases. Colour luminosity and saturation increased in both treatment groups, while hue only changed significantly towards redder feet in supplemented females. Supplemented chicks presented neither different T-cell-mediated immunity nor other differences compared to control chicks. Nevertheless, supplemented females showed tendencies towards decreased immune responses and increased δ15N signatures, and supplemented males towards greater body mass. Our results indicate colouration may have, in females, a signalling function as to compensate for immunological costs. In males, additional availability of carotenoids may contribute to improve the body condition. This study suggests that trade-off responses to carotenoid availability are sex-specific in tern chicks. Thus, parental carotenoid supply to chicks may be an unrecognised component in sex allocation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study shows that the oatmeal nematode, Panagrellus redivivus, has modest cold tolerance with a 50% survival temperature (S50) of −2.5°C after cooling at 0.5°C min−1 and freezing for 1 h. It can survive low temperatures by freezing tolerance and cryoprotective dehydration; although freezing tolerance appears to be the dominant strategy. Freezing survival is enhanced by low temperature acclimation (7 days at 5°C), with the S50 being lowered by a small but significant amount (0.42°C). There is no cold shock or rapid cold hardening response under the conditions tested. Cryoprotective dehydration enhances the ability to survive freezing (the S50 is lowered by 0.55°C, compared to the control, after 4 h freezing at −1°C) and this effect is in addition to that produced by acclimation. Breeding from survivors of a freezing stress did not enhance the ability to survive freezing.

We measured the whole muscle lipid oxidation rates in extensor digitorum communis muscles from white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis Gmelin) incubated for 20 min at 20°C with radiolabeled stearate (18:0), oleate (18:1ω9), or linoleate (18:2ω6). Lipid oxidation rates were ~40% higher with linoleate than oleate (oleate: 36 ± 8.54 μmol CO2 g−1 h−1), and ~75% lower with stearate compared with oleate, indicating that maximal lipid oxidation rates can indeed be affected by the type of fatty acid supplied to the muscle. Additionally, we investigated the activity of the mitochondrial fatty acid transport-associated enzyme carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) in pectoralis muscles of 5 bird species (Zonotrichia albicollis, Philomachus pugnax, Sturnus vulgaris, Taeniopygia guttata, Passer domesticus). Activity was measured in homogenized samples using various fatty acyl-CoA substrates (16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1ω9, 18:2ω6, 18:3ω3, 18:3ω6, 20:0, 20:4ω6, 22:6ω3) in a spectrophotometric assay. CPT activity increased with the degree of unsaturation and decreased with chain length. CPT activity did not differ between ω3 and ω6 isomers of 18:3, nor was the pattern of CPT substrate preference different between captive white-throated sparrows in a migratory (i.e., displaying Zugunruhe) or non-migratory state.

The chemical analysis was performed by employing the potentiometric double titration method and by means of an electron microscope coupled with a spectrometer and X-ray powder diffraction. The results obtained suggest the presence of very insoluble intestinal precipitates, presumably formed by a mixture of CaCO3 and MgCO3, with a higher quantity of the former with respect to the latter. HCO3− secretion rate was investigated with the aid of the pH stat method in isolated tissues mounted in Ussing chamber, where the transepithelial electrical parameters were also measured. When the serosal surface of the intestinal mucosa was bathed in HCO3−-Ringer bubbled with 1% CO2 in O2 while the serosal surface was bathed in HCO3− free Ringer solution bubbled with pure O2, bicarbonate secretion proceeded at an almost stable rate of 0.9 ± 0.05 μeq cm−2 h−1 for about 3 h while Isc maintained a constant value of 38 ± 1.5 μA cm−2. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide elicited a progressive reduction of HCO3− secretion that was about 75% of the initial value after 80 min. When serosal HCO3−–CO2 saline was substituted with Hepes–O2 saline base secretion progressively declined reaching a value of about 20% of the initial value. It was also strongly inhibited when Na+ was substituted with the impermeant cation choline and when either DIDS or ouabain were added to the basolateral side.

Relative contributions of developmental and adult conditions to adult immune function and coloration in mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos),"Developmental conditions affect adult physiological processes and phenotypic traits, including those associated with both survival and reproduction. Carotenoids are molecules that generate sexually attractive coloration, and these pigments are acquired throughout life and can affect antioxidant capacity and immunocompetence of young and old animals. However, few studies have tracked carotenoid status and condition during development and into adulthood to understand how ontogeny affects later-life health and coloration of both males and females. We reared male and female mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) from hatch to adulthood, measured circulating carotenoid titers and body condition (i.e., size-adjusted body mass) throughout development, and assessed adult immune function and integumentary carotenoid-based beak and foot coloration. We found that adult immune function (wing web swelling response to phytohemagglutinin; PHA) in males was positively correlated with body condition during the growth period of development, rather than adult condition, and similarly that both male and female beak coloration was associated with developmental, rather than adult, body condition. We also found associations between coloration and health during adulthood; males with more carotenoid-rich beaks (a sexually attractive feature) tended to have a more robust adult PHA response and a greater antibody response to a novel antigen, while females with less carotenoid-rich beaks had greater antibody responsiveness at adulthood. In addition, male beak color changed over the course of the 24-h PHA test in proportion to the degree of PHA swelling. However, intensity of foot coloration (a trait of unknown sexual significance) was not associated with any condition, carotenoid, or immune metric for males or females. Taken together, our findings implicate key developmental components to the expression of both survival- and reproduction-related traits at adulthood, but that for a dynamic trait like beak color, there are also important adult conditions that can alter signal expression.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, the regulation of this process is still poorly understood, since it may vary with endogenous and exogenous factors. The objective of the present investigation was to quantify the proliferation of nerve cells and number of nerve cells with ecdysone receptors in the clusters of the central olfactory system in Neohelice granulata, according to moult stages and in different seasons (summer and winter). Three injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were administered to the crabs. Brains were sectioned by microtome and fixed on slides for immunohistochemistry with anti-BrdU and anti-EcR antibodies. The proliferation of nerve cells was higher in winter than in summer, probably because in winter the crabs do not breed and the premoult and postmoult periods are longer. Crabs in postmoult exhibited more BrdU-labelled cells than crabs in premoult or intermoult in winter, because of a greater number of mitoses related to an increase in body size and addition of olfactory receptor neurons. The number of EcR-labelled cells was higher in premoult than in postmoult or intermoult in winter. The proliferation of nerve cells is regulated seasonally and according to moult stages.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Members of the genus Arachnocampa (glowworms) use an unusual predatory strategy: larvae bioluminesce to lure positively phototropic insects into their adhesive webs. We investigated the metabolic costs associated with bioluminescence and web maintenance in larval Arachnocampa flava. The mean rate of CO2 production ($$ \dot{V}$$CO2) during continuous bioluminescence was 4.38 μl h−1 ± 0.78 (SEM). The mean $$ \dot{V}$$CO2 of inactive, non-bioluminescing larvae was 3.49 ± 0.35 μl h−1. The mean $$ \dot{V}$$CO2 during web maintenance when not bioluminescencing was 8.95 ± 1.78 μl h−1, a value significantly lower than that measured during trap construction by other predatory arthropods. These results indicate that bioluminescence itself is not energetically expensive, in accordance with our prediction that a high cost of bioluminescence would render the Arachnocampa sit-and-lure predatory strategy inefficient. In laboratory experiments, both elevated feeding rates and daily web removal caused an increase in bioluminescent output. Thus, larvae increase their investment in light output when food is plentiful or when stressed through having to rebuild their webs. As light production is efficient and the cost of web maintenance is relatively low, the energetic returns associated with continuing to glow may outweigh the costs of continuing to attract prey.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The response to these environmental factors is usually a state of inactivity, hibernation and aestivation, respectively, in a temperature and humidity buffered refuge, accompanied by physiological adjustments to resist cold or heat stress. We investigated how environmental factors in the microhabitat and body condition influence the metabolite composition of haemolymph of the endangered species Helix pomatia. We used UPLC and GC–MS techniques and analyzed annual biochemical variations in a multivariate model. Hibernation and activity months differed in metabolite composition. Snails used photoperiod as cue for seasonal climatic variations to initiate a physiological state and were also highly sensitive to temperature variations, therefore constantly adjusting their physiological processes. Galactose levels gave evidence for the persistence of metabolic activity with energy expenditure during hibernation and for high reproductive activity in June. Triglycerides accumulated prior to hibernation might act as cryoprotectants or energy reserves. During the last month of hibernation snails activated physiological processes related to arousal. During activity, protein metabolism was reflected by high amino acid level. An exceptional aestivation period was observed in April giving evidence for heat stress responses, like the protection of cells from dehydration by polyols and saccharides, the membrane stabilization by cholesterol and enhanced metabolism using the anaerobic succinic acid pathway to sustain costly stress responses. In conclusion, physiological adjustments to environmental variations in Helix pomatia involve water loss regulation, cryoprotectant or heatprotectant accumulation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The present study used metabolic acid–base disturbances in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, to evaluate the role played by cortisol in stimulating compensatory responses. Trout infused with acid (an iso-osmotic solution of 70 mmol L−1 HCl), base (140 mmol L−1 NaHCO3) or saline (140 mmol L−1 NaCl) for 24 h exhibited significant elevation of circulating cortisol concentrations. Acid infusion significantly increased both branchial (by 328 μmol kg−1 h−1) and urinary (by 5.9 μmol kg−1 h−1) net acid excretion, compensatory responses that were eliminated by pre-treatment of trout with the cortisol synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (2-methyl-1,2-di-3-pyridyl-1-propanone). The significant decrease in net acid excretion (equivalent to enhanced base excretion) of 203 μmol kg−1 h−1 detected in base-infused trout was unaffected by metyrapone treatment. Acid- and base-infusions also were associated with significant changes in the relative mRNA expression of branchial and renal cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (tCAc) and renal membrane-linked CA IV (tCA IV). Cortisol treatment caused changes in CA gene expression that tended to parallel those observed with acid but not base infusion. For example, significant increases in renal relative tCA IV mRNA expression were detected in both acid-infused (~2x) and cortisol-treated (~10x) trout, whereas tCA IV mRNA expression was significantly reduced (~5x) in base-infused fish. Despite changes in CA gene expression in acid- or base-infused fish, neither acid nor base infusion affected CAc protein levels in the gill, but both caused significant increases in branchial CA activity. Cortisol treatment similarly increased branchial CA activity in the absence of an effect on branchial CAc protein expression. Taken together, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that in rainbow trout, cortisol is involved in mediating acid–base compensatory responses to a metabolic acidosis, and that cortisol exerts its effects at least in part through modulation of CA.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This state is characterized by decreased responsiveness to aversive stimuli, suggesting the manipulation of a neuromodulatory system in the cockroach’s central nervous system. A likely candidate is the opioid system, which is known to affect responsiveness to stimuli in insects. To explore this possibility, we injected cockroaches with different opioid receptor agonists or antagonists before they were stung by a wasp and tested the escape behavior of these cockroaches to electric foot shocks. Antagonists significantly decreased the startle threshold in stung individuals, whereas agonists led to an increased startle threshold in controls. Yet, neither agonists nor antagonists had any effect on grooming. To further characterize the interaction between the venom and opioid receptors, we used an antenna-heart preparation. In un-stung individuals external application of crude venom completely inhibits antenna-heart contractions. In stung individuals the antenna-heart showed no contractions. Although acetylcholine restored contractions, the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was unable to antagonize the venom inhibition.

However, we investigated whether assimilation efficiency (AE), an intermediate step between dietary intake and allocation, can also vary between the sexes. Specifically, we tested whether sex-based differences in AE can explain variation in phenotypic traits. We measured morphometric characteristics (i.e., body length, mass, condition, and musculature) and AE of total energy, crude protein, and crude fat in post-reproductive adult Children’s pythons (which exhibit a limited female-biased sexual size dimorphism) fed both low and high dietary intakes. Meal size was negatively related to AE of energy. Notably, male snakes absorbed crude protein more efficiently and increased epaxial (dorsal) musculature faster than females, which demonstrates a link between AE and phenotype. However, females grew in body length faster but did not absorb any nutrient more efficiently than males. Although our results do not provide a direct link between AE and sexual size dimorphism, they demonstrate that sexual variation in nutrient absorption exists and can contribute to other types of sex-based differences in phenotype (i.e., sexual dimorphism in growth of musculature). Hence, testing the broader applicability of AE’s role in sexually dimorphic traits among other species is warranted.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This has been attributed to adaptation to a hypercarnivorous diet and subsequent loss of the ability to downregulate amino acid catabolism. A quantitative analysis of brain glucose requirements reveals that in cats on their natural diet, a significant proportion of protein must be diverted into gluconeogenesis to supply the brain. According to the model presented here, the high protein requirement of the domestic cat is the result of routing of amino acids into gluconeogenesis to supply the needs of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues, resulting in oxidation of amino acid in excess of the rate predicted for a non-hypercarnivorous mammal of the same size. Thus, cats and other small hypercarnivores do not have a high protein requirement per se, but a high endogenous glucose demand that is met by obligatory amino acid-based gluconeogenesis. It is predicted that for hypercarnivorous mammals with the same degree of encephalisation, endogenous nitrogen losses increase with decreasing metabolic mass as a result of the allometric relationships of brain mass and brain metabolic rate with body mass, possibly imposing a lower limit for body mass in hypercarnivorous mammals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

By measuring the excess post-anoxic oxygen consumption (EPAOC) after 6 and 24 h it was possible to mathematically account for RMR being maintained even though heme stores of oxygen would have been depleted by the animal’s metabolism during the first hours of anoxia. However, EPAOC after 36 h of anoxia could not account for RMR being maintained. Measurements of tissue glycogen disappearance and lactate appearance during anoxia showed that the degree of glycolysis and the timing of its activation varied among tissues. Yet, neither measurement could account for the RMR being maintained during even the 6-h anoxic period. Therefore, two independent analyses of the metabolic responses of hagfish to anoxia exposure suggest that hagfish utilize metabolic rate suppression as part of the strategy for longer-term anoxia survival.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Models developed thus far have been derived from euryhaline fish species that can tolerate a wide range of environmental salinity. This study reports on procedures for the primary culture of a model gill epithelium derived from goldfish, a stenohaline freshwater (FW) fish that cannot tolerate high environmental salt concentrations. The reconstructed goldfish gill epithelium was cultured on permeable filter inserts and using electron microscopy and immunocytochemical techniques, was determined to be composed exclusively of gill pavement cells. When cultured under symmetrical conditions (i.e. with culture medium bathing both apical and basolateral surfaces), epithelial preparations generated appreciable transepithelial resistance (TER) (e.g. 1,150 ± 46 Ωcm2) within 36–42 h post-seeding in inserts. When apical medium was replaced with FW (asymmetrical conditions to mimic conditions that occur in vivo), epithelia exhibited increased TER and elevated paracellular permeability. Changes in permeability occurred in association with altered occludin-immunoreactive band position by western blot and no change in occludin mRNA abundance. We contend that the goldfish gill model will provide a useful in vitro tool for examining the molecular components of a stenohaline fish gill epithelium that participate in the regulation of gill permeability.

In this study, we continuously measured body temperature of southern African hedgehogs (Atelerix frontalis) between April and August 2009 (−10°C < Ta < 43°C), kept under semi-captive conditions. A. frontalis showed a high propensity for torpor with animals spending up to 84% of the measurement period torpid. During this study, A. frontalis displayed the lowest Tb min (ca 1°C) yet recorded in an Afrotropical placental heterotherm. Bout lengths of between 0.7 h (40 min) and 116.3 h (4.8 days) were recorded. Differences in bout length were observed between lighter individuals compared with an individual exhibiting a higher body mass at the onset of winter, with low Mb individuals exhibiting daily torpor whereas a heavier individual exhibited torpor bouts that were indicative of hibernation. Our results suggest that heterothermic responses are an important feature in the energy balance equation of this species and that body mass at the onset of winter may determine the patterns of heterothermy utilised in this species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In fast fibers, the fatigue process has been related to KATP channels. In the present study, we investigated the action of glibenclamide (an anti-diabetic sulphonylurea that acts on KATP channels) on fatigued slow skeletal muscle, studying twitch and tetanus tension after inducing the muscle to fatigue by continuous electrical stimulation. Our results showed that glibenclamide (150 μM) increased post-fatigue twitch tension by about 25% with respect to the fatigued condition (P < 0.05). In addition, glibenclamide (150 μM) increased post-fatigue tetanic tension (83.61 ± 15.7% in peak tension, and 85.0 ± 19.0% in tension-time integral, P = 0.02, and 0.04, respectively; n = 3). Moreover, after exposing the muscle to a condition that inhibits mitochondrial ATP formation in order to activate KATP channels with cyanide (10 mM), tension also diminished, but in the presence of glibenclamide the effect produced by cyanide was abolished. To determine a possible increase in intracellular calcium concentration, the effects of glibenclamide on caffeine-evoked contractures were explored. After muscle pre-incubation with glibenclamide (150 μM), tension of caffeine-evoked contractures increased (6.5 ± 1.5% in maximal tension, and 5.9 ± 3.8% in tension-time integral, P < 0.05). These results suggest a possible role of KATP channels in the fatigue process, since glibenclamide increases twitch and tetanus tension in fatigued slow muscle of the chicken and during metabolic inhibition, possibly by increasing intracellular calcium.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Wax salvage would clearly be counter-productive unless the energy input/energy yield threshold was a profitable one. There are two possible trade-offs in this scenario, the trade-off between the energy expended to recover the wax (recovering hypothesis) as against that of replacing the wax by new secretion (replacing hypothesis). In order to compare the two hypotheses, the fuel costs involved in salvaging wax on one return trip, the average flower handling time, flight time and relative values for substituting the salvaged wax with nectar were calculated. Moreover, the energy value of the wax was determined. Net energy gains for salvaged wax were calculated. The energy value of the salvaged wax was 42.7 J/mg, thus too high to be the limiting factor since salvaging costs are only 642.76 mJ/mg (recovering hypothesis). The recovery costs (642.76 mJ/mg) only fall below the replacement costs for absconding distance below 115 m thus supporting the replacing hypothesis. This energetic trade-off between replacing and recycling plus the small absconding range of A.florea might explain why A.florea is probably the only honeybee species known to salvage wax and it parsimoniously explains the underlying reasons why A.florea only salvages wax from the old nest if the new nesting site is less than 100–200 m away—energetically, it pays off to recycle.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We examined lean mass variation in New World passerines in an area where the distribution of stopover habitat does not require flights to exceed more than a few hours and most migrants stop flying well before fat stores near exhaustion. We used either quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) analysis or a morphometric model to measure or estimate, respectively, the fat and lean body mass of migrants during stopovers in New York, USA. With these data, we examined (1) variance in total body mass explained by lean body mass, (2) hourly rates of fat and lean body mass change in single-capture birds, and (3) net changes in fat and lean mass in recaptured birds. Lean mass contributed to 50% of the variation in total body mass among white-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis and hermit thrushes Catharus guttatus. Lean mass of refueling gray catbirds Dumetella carolinensis and white-throated sparrows, respectively, increased 1.123 and 0.320 g h−1. Lean mass of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapillus accounted for an estimated 33–40% of hourly gains in total body mass. On average 35% of the total mass gained among recaptured birds was lean mass.

In the auditory nerve, periodicities corresponding to frequencies or rates from about 10 Hz to over 1,000 Hz are extracted from pure tones, from low-frequency complex sounds (e.g., 1st harmonic in bullfrog calls), from mid-frequency sounds with low-frequency modulations (e.g., amplitude modulation rates in cat vocalizations), and from time intervals between high-frequency transients (e.g., pulse-echo delay in bat sonar). Time locking of neuronal responses to periodicities from about 50 ms down to 4 ms or less (about 20–300 Hz) is preserved in the auditory midbrain, where responses are dispersed across many neurons with different onset latencies from 4–5 to 20–50 ms. Midbrain latency distributions are wide enough to encompass two or more repetitions of successive acoustic events, so that responses to multiple, successive periods are ongoing simultaneously in different midbrain neurons. These latencies have a previously unnoticed periodic temporal pattern that determines the specific times for the dispersed on-responses.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here we analyzed how these two noise sources affect the recognition of acoustic signals from potential mates in grasshoppers. By progressively corrupting the envelope of a female song, we determined the critical degradation level at which males failed to recognize a courtship call in behavioral experiments. Using the same stimuli, we recorded intracellularly from auditory neurons at three different processing levels, and quantified the corresponding changes in spike train patterns by a spike train metric, which assigns a distance between spike trains. Unexpectedly, for most neurons, intrinsic variability accounted for the main part of the metric distance between spike trains, even at the strongest degradation levels. At consecutive levels of processing, intrinsic variability increased, while the sensitivity to external noise decreased.

Endpoints of hydromineral status (hemolymph Na+, Cl−, and K+ levels, hemolymph pH, body water content, and whole body Na+/K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase activity) were examined 1, 3, 5, 12 and 24 h following BW transfer. Larvae transferred from FW to FW served as a control. Hemolymph Na+ and Cl− levels increased following BW transfer. Hemolymph pH was initially regulated, but significantly decreased after 24 h in BW. Changes in hemolymph ions were not caused by osmotic loss of water from the hemolymph, since larvae tightly regulated total body moisture content. Furthermore, salinity did not affect hemolymph K+. When larvae were transferred to BW, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity did not significantly alter relative to FW control animals. In contrast, V-type H+-ATPase (VA) activity in C. riparius significantly decreased in BW. In FW-reared C. riparius, whole body NKA and VA activities were equivalent. However, in the isolated gut with intact Malpighian tubules of FW-reared C. riparius, VA activity was significantly greater than whole body while NKA activity was equivalent. This suggested that gut and/or Malpighian tubule VA activity contributes significantly to whole body VA activity and that a decline in whole body VA activity in BW may be closely linked to alterations in the physiology of gut and Malpighian tubule tissue. Taken together, data indicate that VA is important for ion uptake in FW and that the NKA does not play a major role in regulating ion homeostasis when larvae are acutely exposed to BW.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The central hemodynamic of embryonic reptiles are unique, given the additional systemic aorta that allows pulmonary circulatory bypass, the left aorta (LAo). The LAo exits in the right ventricle or ‘pulmonary side’ of reptilian hearts in both embryos and adults, but its functional significance in ovo is unknown. This study investigated the role of the LAo in embryonic American alligators by surgically occluding the LAo and measuring oxygen consumption and, in addition, measured hemodynamic responses to hypoxia in embryonic alligators. We measured systemic cardiac output and primary chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) artery blood flow for normoxic and hypoxic-incubated (10% O2) American alligator embryos (Alligator mississippiensis). Chronic blood flow (1–124 h) in the primary CAM artery for hypoxic-incubated embryos (92 ± 26 ml min−1 kg−1) was elevated when compared with normoxic-incubated embryos (29 ± 14 ml min−1 kg−1, N = 6; P = 0.039). For hypoxic-incubated embryos, acute LAo blood flow (49.6 ± 24.4 ml min−1 kg−1) was equivalent to the combined flow of the three systemic great vessels that arise from the left ventricle, the right aorta, common carotid and subclavian arteries (43.6 ± 21.5 ml min−1 kg−1, N = 5). Similarly, for normoxic-incubated embryos, LAo blood flow (27.3 ± 6.6 ml min−1 kg−1) did not statistically differ from the other three vessels (18.4 ± 4.9 ml min−1 kg−1, N = 5). This study contains the first direct test of LAo function and the first measurements of blood flow in an embryonic reptile. These data support the hypotheses that embryonic alligators utilize the LAo to divert a significant amount of right ventricular blood into the systemic circulation, and that CAM blood flow increases following chronic hypoxic conditions.

The spatial separation between the sound receiving spiracle and the hearing organ in this species allows manipulations of the sensory cells without interfering with the acoustical measurements. We tried to interfere with the DPOAE generation by pharmacologically influencing the tympanal organ using the insecticide pymetrozine. The compound appears to act selectively on scolopidia, i.e., the mechanosensor type characteristically constituting tympanal organs. Pymetrozine solutions were applied as closely as possible to the scolopidia via a cuticle opening in the tibia, distally to the organ.

Ecotone populations deviated slightly from the allometric relationship between body size and peak frequency for the genus, and there was no relationship between these variables within R. capensis. Nasal chamber length was the best predictor of peak frequency but not correlated with body size. The evolution of echolocation thus appears to have been uncoupled from body size in R. capensis. Furthermore, females used higher frequencies than males, which imply a potential social role for peak frequency. The differences in peak frequency may have originated from random founder effects and then compounded by genetic drift and/or natural selection. The latter may have acted directly on peak frequency altering skull parameters involved in echolocation independently of body size, resulting in the evolution of local acoustic signatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Breeding males Brachyhypopomus gauderio produce electric organ discharge (EOD) rate modulations called chirps while females respond with interruptions. The electromotor system is commanded by a pacemaker nucleus (PN) which sets the basal rate and produces the rate modulations. We focused on identifying functional, seasonal and sexual differences in this nucleus in correlation to these differences in behavior. The in vivo response to glutamate injection in the PN was seasonal, sexually dimorphic and site specific. Non-breeding adults and breeding females injected in dorsal and ventral sites generated EOD rate increases and interruptions, respectively. Reproductive males added a conspicuous communication signal to this repertoire. They chirped repetitively when we injected glutamate in a very restricted area of the ventral–rostral nucleus, surprisingly one with a low number of relay cell somata. This study shows that the PN is functionally organized in regions in a caudal–rostral axis, besides the previously documented dorsal–ventral division.

These pheromones are produced in the labial glands and are nest and species specific. Thus, an important question is how recruited foragers recognize their nestmates’ pheromone in the field. We tested whether naïve workers learn a specific trail pheromone composition while being recruited by nestmates inside the hive in the species Scaptotrigona pectoralis. We installed artificial scent trails branching off from trails deposited by recruiting foragers and registered whether newly recruited bees follow these trails. The artificial trails were baited with trail pheromones of workers collected from foreign S. pectoralis colonies. When the same foreign trail pheromone was presented inside the experimental hives while recruitment took place a significant higher number of bees followed the artificial trails than in experiments without intranidal presentation. Our results demonstrate that recruits of S. pectoralis can learn the composition of specific trail pheromone bouquets inside the nest and subsequently follow this pheromone in the field. We, therefore, suggest that trail pheromone recognition in S. pectoralis is based on a flexible learning process rather than being a genetically fixed behaviour.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Changes in body composition during postnatal development in the big brown bat,"Patterns of offspring development reflect the availability of energy and nutrients, limitations on an individual’s capacity to use available resources, and tradeoffs between the use of nutrients to support current metabolic demands and tissue growth. To determine if the long period of offspring dependency in bats is associated with the need for an advanced state of tissue maturation prior to flight, we examined body composition during postnatal growth in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus. Despite their large size at birth (22% of maternal mass), newborn bats are relatively immature, containing 82% body water in fat-free mass. However, the total body water content of newborn bat pups decreases to near-adult levels in advance of weaning, while concentrations of total body fat and protein exceed adult values. In contrast to many other mammals, postnatal growth of bat pups was characterized by relatively stable concentrations of calcium and phosphorus, but declining concentrations of magnesium. These levels remained stable or rebounded in late postnatal development. This casts doubt on the hypothesis that low rates of mineral transfer necessitate an extended lactation period in bats. However, our finding of near-adult body composition at weaning is consistent with the hypothesis that extended lactation in bats is necessary for the young to achieve sufficient tissue maturity to undertake the active flight necessary for independent feeding. In this respect, bats differ from most other mammals but resemble birds that must engage in active flight to achieve nutritional independence.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The oxygen-binding properties of both hemoglobin components purified by DEAE cellulose were almost identical to those of the hemolysate: stripped hemoglobin showed a large Bohr effect which was enhanced by chloride ions and, at a larger extent, by organic phosphates which, at acidic pH values gave rise to the Root effect. A series of oxygen-binding experiments at increasing GTP concentrations was carried out in order to compare GTP-binding activities in the absence and presence of physiological amounts of chloride. The results indicated that hemoglobin do have two sites for GTP binding. In the absence of chloride, the two sites cannot be discriminated, whereas in the presence of chloride, a competition between the two anions occurred for both GTP-binding sites.

The first section is concerned with how neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL), the nucleus ventral to the IC, respond to species-specific signals and how they compare to responses of IC neurons evoked by the same signals. Those studies showed that DNLL neurons have no sideband inhibition and their responses are determined by excitation. In contrast, inhibition dominates in the IC where it carves out highly selective discharge properties. Those studies, in turn, raised questions about the quantitative features of inhibition that could only be answered with more sophisticated techniques.

The ratio of the two states in photoequilibrium is determined by their absorbance spectra and the effective spectral distribution of illumination. Calculations indicate that metarhodopsin levels in fly photoreceptors are maintained below ~35% in normal diurnal environments, due to the combination of a blue-green rhodopsin, an orange-absorbing metarhodopsin and red transparent screening pigments. Slow metarhodopsin degradation and rhodopsin regeneration processes further subserve visual pigment maintenance. In most insect eyes, where the majority of photoreceptors have green-absorbing rhodopsins and blue-absorbing metarhodopsins, natural illuminants are predicted to create metarhodopsin levels greater than 60% at high intensities. However, fast metarhodopsin decay and rhodopsin regeneration also play an important role in controlling metarhodopsin in green receptors, resulting in a high rhodopsin content at low light intensities and a reduced overall visual pigment content in bright light.

These relationships have been combined in the ‘membrane pacemaker hypothesis of aging’. It suggests that membrane PUFA content might determine an animal’s life span. PUFAs in general and certain long-chain PUFAs in particular, are highly prone to lipid peroxidation which brings about a high rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of either n-3 or n-6 PUFAs might affect (1) membrane phospholipid composition of heart and liver tissues and (2) life span of the animals due to the altered membrane composition, and subsequent effects on lipid peroxidation. Therefore, we kept female laboratory mice from the C57BL/6 strain on three diets (n-3 PUFA rich, n-6 PUFA rich, control) and assessed body weights, life span, heart, and liver phospholipid composition after the animals had died. We found that while membrane phospholipid composition clearly differed between feeding groups, life span was not directly affected.

While overall hyperosmoregulatory capability is weak in A. franca and moderate in M. brasiliense, both species strongly hyporegulate hemolymph [Cl−] but not osmolality. Muscle total free amino acids (FAA) increase slowly but markedly in response to the rapid rise in hemolymph osmolality consequent to hyperosmotic challenge: 3.5-fold in A. franca and 1.9-fold in M. brasiliense. Glycine, taurine, arginine, alanine and proline constitute ≈85% of muscle FAA pools in fresh water; taurine, arginine, alanine each contribute ≈22% in A. franca, while glycine predominates (70%) in M. brasiliense. These FAA also show the greatest increases on salinity challenge. Muscle FAA titers correlate strongly (R = 0.82) with hemolymph osmolalities across the main decapod sub/infraorders, revealing that marine species with high hemolymph osmolalities achieve isosmoticity of the intra- and extracellular fluids partly through elevated intracellular FAA concentrations; freshwater species show low hemolymph osmolalities and exhibit reduced intracellular FAA titers, consistent with isosmoticity at a far lower external osmolality. Given the decapod phylogeny adopted here and their multiple, independent invasions of fresh water, particularly by the Caridea and Anomura, our findings suggest that homoplastic strategies underlie osmotic and ionic homeostasis in the extant freshwater Decapoda.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This Na+ transport can be measured as the amiloride-blockable short-circuit current (SCC) across the skin. We investigated the effects of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MT), and those of antagonists of the vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, on the SCC across Hyla japonica skin. (1) Both AVT (100 pmol/L or more) and MT (1 nmol/L or more) increased the SCC. (2) The AVT- and MT-induced increases in SCC recovered with time (downregulation). (3) These AVT/MT-induced effects were blocked by application of OPC-31260 (vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist). (4) The OPC-31260 concentration needed to block the AVT-induced response was lower upon post-application (after application of agonist) than upon pre-application (before application of agonist), suggesting the number of receptors may have decreased after AVT application. (5) Upon repeated application of AVT (100 pmol/L), the induced SCC increase did not differ significantly between the 1st and 2nd applications. (6) The time to reach the half-maximum value of the AVT-induced or MT-induced increase in SCC was not significantly different between washout and post-application of OPC-31260, suggesting that post-application of OPC-31260 cleared AVT and MT from their receptors.

However, little is known about the molecular architecture of the tight junction (TJ) complex and the regulation of paracellular permeability characteristics in these tissues. In the current studies, puffer fish (Tetraodon biocellatus) were acclimated to freshwater (FW), seawater (SW) or ion-poor freshwater (IPW) conditions. Following acclimation, alterations in systemic endpoints of hydromineral status were examined in conjunction with changes in gill and kidney epithelia morphology/morphometrics, as well as claudin TJ protein mRNA abundance. T. biocellatus were able to maintain endpoints of hydromineral status within relatively tight limits across the broad range of water ion content examined. Both gill and kidney tissue exhibited substantial alterations in morphology as well as claudin TJ protein mRNA abundance. These responses were particularly pronounced when comparing fish acclimated to SW versus those acclimated to IPW. TEM observations of IPW-acclimated fish gills revealed the presence of cells that exhibited the typical characteristics of gill mitochondria-rich cells (e.g. voluminous, Na+-K+-ATPase-immunoreactive, exposed to the external environment at the apical surface), but were not mitochondria-rich. To our knowledge, this type of cell has not previously been described in hyperosmoregulating fish gills. Furthermore, modifications in the morphometrics and claudin mRNA abundance of kidney tissue support the notion that spatial alterations in claudin TJ proteins along the nephron of fishes will likely play an important role in the regulation of salt and water balance in these organisms.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, we comparatively investigate the neural regeneration in the auditory system in the bush cricket Mecopoda elongata. A crushing of the tympanal nerve in the foreleg of M. elongata results in a loss of auditory information transfer. Physiological recordings of the tympanal nerve suggest outgrowing fibers 5 days after crushing. An anatomical regeneration of the fibers within the central nervous system starts 10 days after crushing. The neuronal projection reaches the target area at day 20. Threshold values to low frequency airborne sound remain high after crushing, indicating a lower regeneration capability of this group of fibers.

We created an artificial obstacle course for the ants between a feeder and their nest. Landmarks comprised natural objects in the landscape such as logs, branches, and tussocks. Many ants travelled stereotypical routes home through the obstacle course in training, threading repeatedly the same gaps in the landmarks. Manipulations altering the relations between the landmarks and the surrounding panorama, however, affected the routes in two major ways. Both interchanging the positions of landmarks (transpositions) and displacing the entire landmark set along with the starting position of the ants (translations) (1) reduced the stereotypicality of the route, and (2) increased turns and meanders during travel.

Ipc neurons responded to a variety of moving or flashing stimuli as long as those stimuli were small. When mapped with a moving spot, the excitatory receptive field was of circular Gaussian shape with an average half-width of less than 3°. We found no evidence for directional sensitivity. For moving spots of varying sizes, the measured Ipc response-size profile was reproduced by the linear Difference-of-Gaussian model, which is consistent with the superposition of a narrow excitatory center and an inhibitory surround. Intracellular Ipc recordings revealed a strong inhibitory connection from the nucleus isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc), which has the anatomical feature to provide a broad inhibitory projection.

Variations in O2 levels require many anatomical, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical adaptations that ensure the uptake of an adequate amount of O2. Some fish species are comparatively well adapted to tolerate low O2 partial pressure (hypoxia). The Japanese ricefish medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an important model organism for biomedical research that shows remarkable tolerance towards hypoxia. We have investigated the regulation and role of globins under hypoxia. We applied four different regimes of chronic hypoxia (24 and 48 h at PO2 = 2 or 4 kPa) as well as acute hypoxia (2 h at PO2 = 0.5 kPa) to adult male medaka. Changes of mRNA levels of seven globin genes (adult hemoglobin α and β, myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin 1 and 2, globin X), three hypoxia-response genes (lactate dehydrogenase b, phosphoglycerate kinase, adrenomedullin 1) and two putative reference genes (cyclophilin, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) were monitored by means of quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. We observed strong upregulation of myoglobin, which is also expressed in the medaka brain, as previously demonstrated for carp, goldfish and zebrafish. The hemoglobin chains were found upregulated, whereas earlier studies found down-regulation of hemoglobin in hypoxic zebrafish. By contrast, neuroglobin mRNA was not affected by hypoxia in medaka, but had been found upregulated in zebrafish. Globin X is induced in medaka brain, but down-regulated in zebrafish. Thus, the patterns of hypoxia response of globins are strikingly different in various fish species, which can be interpreted as indication for different roles of the various globins in hypoxia response and for alternative metabolic strategies of fish species in coping with O2 deprivation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) can both detect hydrodynamic stimuli caused by a small sphere vibrating in the water (hydrodynamic dipole stimuli). Hydrodynamic trail following has only been shown in harbour seals. Hydrodynamical and biomechanical studies of single vibrissae of the two species showed that the specialized undulated structure of harbour seal vibrissae, as opposed to the smooth structure of sea lion vibrissae, suppresses self-generated noise in the actively moving animal. Here we tested whether also sea lions were able to perform hydrodynamic trail following in spite of their non-specialized hair structure. Hydrodynamic trails were generated by a remote-controlled miniature submarine. Linear trails could be followed with high accuracy, comparable to the performance of harbour seals, but in contrast, increasing delay resulted in a reduced performance as compared to harbour seals. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that structural differences in the vibrissal hair types of otariid compared to phocid pinnipeds lead to different sensitivity of the vibrissae during forward swimming, but still reveal a good performance even in the species with non-specialized hair type.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Although many snakes are arboreal, no previous study has determined whether they can perceive structural variation of branches that is mechanically relevant to their locomotion. We tested whether the gap distance, location, and attributes of two destination perches on the far side of a crossable gap affected the route travelled by North American rat snakes (Pantherophis), which are proficient climbers. Snakes usually chose routes with shorter gaps. Within a horizontal plane, the snakes usually went straight rather than crossing an equal distance gap with a 90° turn, which was consistent with our finding that crossing a straight gap was easier. However, decreasing the distance of the gap with a 90° turn eliminated the preference for going straight. Additional factors, such as the width of the landing surface and the complexity of branching of the destination perches, resulted in non-random route choice. Thus, many of the observed biases in route choice suggested abilities to perceive structural variation and select routes that are mechanically beneficial.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In both species the peak frequencies of the narrowband frequency component from samples of bats flying with conspecifics varied more than those from samples of bats flying alone, indicating intraspecific jamming avoidance. If individuals of the two species were recorded together, we found no reaction of P. nathusii. P. pipistrellus, however, used significantly higher frequencies than when recorded alone. As the narrowband frequency of this species normally overlaps with the frequency modulated (FM) part of P. nathusii calls, this can be interpreted as an interspecific jamming avoidance response.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The foremost feathers in the cascade have to bear high lift-loading with a strong bending during soaring flight. A challenge to the study of feather aerodynamics is to understand how the observed low drag and high lift values in the Reynolds (Re) regime from 1.0 to 2.0E4 can be achieved. Computed micro-tomography images show that the feather responds to high lift-loading with an increasing nose-droop and profile-camber. Wind-tunnel tests conducted with the foremost primary feather of a White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) at Re = 1.8E4 indicated a surprisingly high maximum lift coefficient of 1.5 and a glide ratio of nearly 10. We present evidence that this is due to morphologic characteristics formed by the cristae dorsales as well as air-permeable arrays along the rhachis. Measurements of lift and drag forces with open and closed pores confirmed the efficiency of this mechanism. Porous structures facilitate a blow out, comparable to technical blow-hole turbulators for sailplanes and low speed turbine-blades. From our findings, we conclude that the mechanism has evolved in order to affect the boundary layer and to reduce aerodynamic drag of the feather.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

One class of midbrain neurons, referred to as ‘interval-counting’ cells, appears to be particularly important for discriminating among calls that differ in pulse repetition rate (PRR). These cells only respond after several pulses are presented with appropriate interpulse intervals. Here we show that the range of selectivity and sharpness of interval tuning vary considerably across neurons. Whole-cell recordings revealed that neurons showing temporally summating excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with little or no inhibition or activity-dependent enhancement of excitation exhibited low-pass or band-pass tuning to slow PRRs. Neurons that showed inhibition and rate-dependent enhancement of excitation, however, were band-pass or high-pass to intermediate or fast PRRs. Surprisingly, across cells, interval tuning based on membrane depolarization and spike rate measures were not significantly correlated. Neurons that lacked inhibition showed the greatest disparities between these two measures of interval tuning. Cells that showed broad membrane potential-based tuning, for example, varied considerably in their spike rate-based tuning; narrow spike rate-based tuning resulted from ‘thresholding’ processes, whereby only the largest depolarizations triggered spikes. The potential constraints associated with generating interval tuning in this manner are discussed.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We examined the structure of the pacemaker nucleus, responsible for the EOD rate, to explore whether its high output signal diversity was correlated to complexity in its neural components or regional organization. We confirm the existence of only two neuron types and show that the previously reported dorsal–caudal segregation of these neurons is accompanied by rostral–caudal regionalization. Pacemaker cells are grouped dorsally in the rostral half of the nucleus, and relay cells are mainly ventral and more abundant in the caudal half. Relay cells are loosely distributed from the center to the periphery of the nucleus in correlation to somata size. Our findings support the hypothesis that regional organization enables a higher diversity of rate modulations, possibly offering distinct target areas to modulatory inputs.

Their recently ovulated eggs are microlecithal (1–2 mm) and lack fatty yolk platelets; thus, virtually all of the nutrients for embryonic development must pass across the placenta. We quantified the net uptake of nutrients during gestation in an Andean population of Mabuya and compared these results with other matrotrophic skinks and eutherian mammals. Total dry and wet masses, ash and organic content, ions (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron), lipids (cholesterol, vitamin E and fatty acids in the major lipid classes—triacylglycerol, phospholipids, cholesteryl ester, free fatty acids), nitrogen (an index of protein) were measured during the different developmental stages throughout gestation, and in neonates. A significant net uptake of inorganic and organic matter was found. This uptake begins slowly during early gestation but accelerates during the last third of gestation when the growth of the embryo is maximal and the allantoplacenta has developed its greatest complexity. The drastic reduction of egg size in this clade is related to the great reduction in the contribution of lecithotrophic nutrients to the embryo, an obligatory placentotrophy from early developmental stages, and the highest placental complexity known in the Reptilia.

In the control group, capillarisation, which is extremely low in gilthead sea bream white muscle, showed a significantly higher number of fibres with no surrounding capillaries (F0) in the cranial area than in the caudal area, unlike the exercise group.

Moreover, they have potential antioxidant capacity, scavenging free radicals and protecting cell compartments from oxidation. Most essential carotenoids are fat soluble and could be stored for times of need especially in adipose tissues, built up by migratory birds as the main source of energy on long-distance flights. In an exclusive diet experiment, garden warblers (Sylvia borin) were fed ad libitum with an experimental diet, enriched with two different dose rates of carotenoids, or with control food, during the period of their first autumn migration. Plasma carotenoid content was measured via HPLC and chroma of plasma and fat examined with a spectrophotometer. Birds were infected with Isospora spp. and intensity of infection determined by oocyst counts 3 days post infection. Plasma lutein levels and chroma of subcutaneous fat stores were positively correlated and chroma values of these fat stores increased in the birds that got the higher dose rate, whereas they decreased significantly in the control group after infection with Isospora spp. Chroma of subcutaneous fat deposits in vivo and intensity of Isospora infection were negatively correlated. By measuring the chroma of fat deposits in vivo, we show that fat can be a reservoir for carotenoids.

This high Purea allows fast equilibration of urea in erythrocytes during their transit in the hyperosmotic renal medulla. It also allows more urea (in addition to that in plasma) to participate in counter-current exchange between ascending and descending vasa recta, thus improving the trapping of urea in the medulla and improving urine concentrating ability. To determine if Purea in erythrocytes is related to diet and urine concentrating ability, we measured Purea in erythrocytes from 11 different mammals and 5 birds using stopped-flow light scattering. Carnivores (dog, fox, cat) exhibited high Purea (in ×10−5 cm/s, 5.3 ± 0.6, 3.8 ± 0.5 and 2.8 ± 0.7, respectively). In contrast, herbivores (cow, donkey, sheep) showed much lower Purea (0.8 ± 0.2, 0.7 ± 0.2, 1.0 ± 0.1, respectively). Erythrocyte Purea in human (1.1 ± 0.2), and pig (1.5 ± 0.1), the two omnivores, was intermediate. Rodents and lagomorphs (mouse, rat, rabbit) had Purea intermediate between carnivores and omnivores (3.3 ± 0.4, 2.5 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively). Birds that do not excrete urea and do not express UT-B in their erythrocytes had very low values (<0.1 × 10−5 cm/s). In contrast to Purea, water permeability, measured simultaneously, was relatively similar in all mammals. The species differences in erythrocytes Purea most probably reflect adaptation to the different types of diet and resulting different needs for concentrating urea in the urine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

They steered towards the higher chirp rate after a delay of only 2.2–6 s, depending on the rate difference between the song alternatives. In this time period, the female experienced only one to two additional chirps in the song model with the higher rate.

Spike rates of auditory receptors and primary-like local neurons did not depend on modulation frequencies while other local and ascending neurons had lowpass, bandpass or bandstop properties. Local neurons exhibited broader dynamic ranges of their rate MTF that extended to higher modulation frequencies than those of most ascending neurons. We found no indication that a filter bank for modulation frequencies may exist in grasshoppers as has been proposed for the auditory system of mammals. The filter properties of half of the neurons changed to an allpass type with a 50% reduction of modulation depths. Contrasting to reports for mammals, the sensitivity to small modulation depths was not enhanced at higher processing stages. In ascending neurons, a focus on the range of low modulation frequencies was visible in the temporal MTFs, which describe the temporal locking of spikes to the signal envelope. To investigate the influence of stimulus rise time, we used rectangularly modulated stimuli instead of sinusoidally modulated ones. Unexpectedly, steep stimulus onsets had only small influence on the shape of MTF curves of 70% of neurons in our sample.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Transmitter and receiver of the echolocation system in flutter detecting foragers are especially adapted for the processing of flutter information. The adaptations of the transmitter are indicated by a flutter induced increase in duty cycle, and by Doppler shift compensation (DSC) that keeps the carrier frequency of the insect echoes near a reference frequency. An adaptation of the receiver is the auditory fovea on the basilar membrane, a highly expanded frequency representation centred to the reference frequency. The afferent projections from the fovea lead to foveal areas with an overrepresentation of sharply tuned neurons with best frequencies near the reference frequency throughout the entire auditory pathway. These foveal neurons are very sensitive to stimuli with natural and simulated flutter information. The frequency range of the foveal areas with their flutter processing neurons overlaps exactly with the frequency range where DS compensating bats most likely receive echoes from fluttering insects. This tight match indicates that auditory fovea and DSC are adaptations for the detection and evaluation of insects flying in clutter.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We investigated the syringeal and respiratory dynamics of vocalization by two 6-month-old males, whose songs had a number of adult features. There was no strong lateral syringeal dominance and unilateral phonation was most often achieved by closing the syringeal valve on the contralateral side of the syrinx. Unlike other songbirds studied, magpies sometimes used an alternative syringeal motor pattern during unilateral phonation in which both sides of the syrinx are partially adducted and open to airflow. Also, in contrast to most other songbirds, the higher fundamental frequency during two-voice syllables was usually generated on the left side of the syrinx. Amplitude modulation, a prominent feature of magpie song, was produced by linear or nonlinear interactions between different frequencies which may originate either on opposite sides of the syrinx or on the same side. Pulse tones, similar to vocal fry in human speech, were present in some calls. Unlike small songbirds, the fundamental of the modal frequency can be as low as that of the pulse tone, suggesting that large birds may have evolved pulse tones to increase acoustic diversity, rather than decrease the fundamental frequency.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Echo classification is essential for bats’ everyday life; for instance, it enables bats to use acoustical landmarks for navigation and to recognize food sources from other objects. Most of the research of echo based object classification in echo-locating bats was done in the context of simple artificial objects. These objects might represent prey, flower, or fruit and are characterized by simple echoes with a single up to several reflectors. Bats, however, must also be able to use echoes that return from complex structures such as plants or other types of background. Such echoes are characterized by superpositions of many reflections that can only be described using a stochastic statistical approach. Scientists have only lately started to address the issue of complex echo classification by echo-locating bats. Some behavioral evidence showing that bats can classify complex echoes has been accumulated and several hypotheses have been suggested as to how they do so.

The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic partner, the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) compute characteristics of expanding edges across the locust eye during a loom and DCMD synapses onto motor elements associated with behaviour. We identified another descending interneuron within the locust ventral nerve cord. We named this neuron the late DCMD (LDCMD) as it responds later during an approach, with the firing rate peaking at about the time of collision. LDCMD produced lower amplitude, broader action potentials that were associated with an afterhyperpolarization, whereas DCMD action potentials showed a brief afterhyperpolarization often followed by an afterdepolarization. Within the mesothoracic ganglion, the primary LDCMD axon located adjacent to the DCMD axon, was thinner and lacked collateral projections to the lateral region of the neuropil. When compared with DCMD, LDCMD fired with fewer spikes during a loom and showed weaker habituation to repeated approaches. Coincidence of LDCMD and DCMD firing increased during object approach.

Here we describe a new role of C1 cells in gastropod mollusks: control of activity of ciliated epithelium in the foregut. Detailed morphological investigation of C1 neurons in the pteropod mollusk Clionelimacina revealed that these cells among other destinations send their neurites into foregut where they produce intense arborization with large varicosities along the processes. Intracellular stimulation of a single C1 induced pronounced activation (often followed by inhibition) of cilia lining the foregut. This activation was substantially reduced by serotonin antagonist mianserin. Bath application of serotonin also induced transient increase in ciliary transport rate, followed by inhibition of ciliary activity up to its full cessation in some areas of isolated foregut. These data suggest that C1 in Clione may use serotonin to influence cilia in the foregut.

T can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol (E2), and variation in conversion rate may partly explain some contradictory findings in the literature. Moreover, most studies on the effect of T on sexual signals have focused on the male sex only, while in many species females show the same signal, albeit to a lesser extent. We studied the effects of T, DHT, and E2 treatment in male and female diamond doves Geopelia cuneata in which both sexes have an enlarged red eye ring, which is more pronounced in males. We first showed that this periorbital ring contains very high concentration of carotenoids, of which most are lutein esters. Both T and DHT were effective in enhancing hue, UV-chroma and size in both sexes, while E2 was ineffective. However, E2 dramatically increased the concentration of circulating lipoproteins.

Using slowly moving discs presented on a computer screen it could be shown for the first time that visual stimuli alone can elicit attack behavior (abrupt approaching reactions) in these spiders as well. These observations suggest that visual information could be used by the spiders to elicit and guide predatory behavior.

However, the nature of compensatory reflexes mediated by mechanoreceptors on the antennae is unknown. In this study we describe an abdominal flexion response mediated by the antennal mechanosensory input during mechanical body rotations. Such reflexive abdominal motions lead to shifts in the animal’s center of mass, and therefore changes in flight trajectory. Moths respond with abdominal flexion both to visual and mechanical rotations, but the mechanical response depends on the presence of the mass of the flagellum. In addition, the mechanically mediated flexion response is about 200° out of phase with the visual response and adds linearly to it.

Cu transport was stimulated by low luminal pH (4.0 vs. 7.4), to a greater extent than explained by the increased availability of the free Cu2+ ion. At pH = 4.0, uptake kinetics were indicative of a low affinity (Km = 525 μmol L−1), saturable carrier-mediated component superimposed on a large linear (diffusive and/or convective) component, with about 50% occurring by each pathway at Cu = 50 μmol L−1. Osmotic gradient experiments showed that solvent drag via fluid transport may play a role in Cu uptake via the stomach, in contrast to the intestine. Also unlike the intestine, neither the Na+ gradient, high Ag, nor phenamil had any influence on gastric Cu transport, and a tenfold excess of Fe and Zn failed to inhibit Cu uptake. These findings indicate that neither Na+-dependent pathways nor DMT1 are likely candidates for carrier-mediated Cu transport in the stomach. We have cloned a partial cDNA sequence for the copper transporter Ctr1, and show its mRNA expression in all segments of the trout gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach. Based on the fact that this transporter is functional at low pH conventionally found in the stomach lumen, we suggest Ctr1 is a pathway for gastric Cu transport in trout. Extreme hypoxia inhibited Cu uptake. High $$ P_{{{\text{CO}}_{2} }} $$ levels (7.5 torr) increased Cu uptake and acetazolamide (100 μmol L−1) significantly inhibited Cu uptake, indicating carbonic anhydrase activity was involved in gastric Cu transport. Transport of Cu was insensitive to bafilomycin (10 μmol L−1) suggesting a V-ATPase did not play a direct role in the process. Expression (mRNA) of H+, K+-ATPase, carbonic anhydrase 2, and the α-3 isoform of Na+–K+-ATPase were observed in the stomach.

American crows had wider binocular overlap, longer vertical binocular fields, narrower blind areas, and higher amplitude of eye movement than Western scrub jays. American crows can converge their eyes and see their own bill tip, which may facilitate using different foraging techniques (e.g., pecking, probing) and manufacturing and handing rudimentary tools. Western scrub jays had a higher head movement rate than American crows while on the ground, and the opposite between-species difference was found when individuals were perching. Faster head movements may enhance the ability to scan the environment, which may be related to a higher perceived risk of predation of Western scrub jays when on the ground, and American crows when perching.

In the present study, the physiological properties of this cannabinoid-dependent LTD were examined. Increases in intracellular calcium in the S interneuron are necessary for this form of LTD in this circuit. Calcium signals contributing to cannabinoid-dependent LTD are mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channel and release of calcium from intracellular stores. Inositol triphosphate receptors, but not ryanodine receptors, appear to mediate this store-released calcium signal. Cannabinoid-dependent LTD also requires activation of metabotropic serotonin receptors, possibly a serotonin type 2-like receptor. Finally, this form of LTD involves the stimulation of nitric oxide synthase and a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling, both of which appeared to be downstream of cannabinoid receptor activation. Based on these findings, the cellular signaling mechanisms of cannabinoid-dependent LTD in the leech are remarkably similar to vertebrate forms of cannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The experimental animals (6 males, 6 females) had to learn and perform a simple orientational task, firstly in the absence of landmarks and subsequently in the presence of four acoustic landmarks of which one was occasionally removed during the critical experiment. The results presented here show that gender differences in the use of acoustic landmarks exist in P. discolor, which supports our hypothesis that the phenomenon is independent of the modality that is used to sense the environment during orientation. Therefore, our findings allow for the prediction of similar phenomena in other acoustically orienting mammals. Interestingly, due to the specific ecology of P. discolor, our results partially contradict the evolutionary theories on gender-specific orientation, as will be discussed.

The effectiveness of IIDs for echolocation is undisputed, but when bats ensonify complex objects, the temporal structure of echoes may facilitate the analysis of the echo envelope in terms of envelope ITDs. Using extracellular recordings from the auditory midbrain of the bat, Phyllostomus discolor, we found a population of neurons that are sensitive to envelope ITDs of echoes of their sonar calls. Moreover, the envelope-ITD sensitivity improved with increasing temporal fluctuations in the echo envelopes, a sonar parameter related to the spatial statistics of complex natural reflectors like vegetation. The data show that in bats envelope ITDs may be used not only to locate external, prey-generated rustling sounds but also in the context of echolocation.

We addressed this issue by recording intracellularly from second-order neurons in the adult goldfish retina. In order to test whether cone-driven horizontal cells (HCs) receive UV cone inputs, we performed chromatic adaptation experiments with mono- and biphasic HCs. We found no functional evidence of a projection from the UV-sensitive cones to these neurons in adult animals. This suggests that goldfish UV receptors may contact preferentially triphasic HCs, which is at odds with the hypothesis that all cones contact all cone-driven HC types. However, we did find evidence of direct M-cone input to monophasic HCs, favoring the idea that cone–HC contacts are more promiscuous than originally proposed.

There is also an associated wing reduction, since flight is no longer required to evade bats. Wing reduction may also affect sound production. Here, the auditory system in four silent grasshopper species belonging to the Podismini is investigated. In this group, tympanal ears occur but sound signalling does not. The tympanal organs range from fully developed to remarkably reduced tympana. To evaluate the effects of tympanal regression on neuronal organisation and auditory sensitivity, the size of wings and tympana, sensory thresholds and sensory central projections are compared. Reduced tympanal size correlates with a higher auditory threshold. The threshold curves of all four species are tuned to low frequencies with a maximal sensitivity at 3–5 kHz. Central projections of the tympanal nerve show characteristics known from fully tympanate acridid species, so neural elements for tympanal hearing have been strongly conserved across these species. The results also confirm the correlation between reduction in auditory sensitivity and wing reduction. It is concluded that the auditory sensitivity of all four species may be maintained by stabilising selective forces, such as predation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It is often assumed that wall following serves an exploratory function, but this assertion remains untested against alternative artifactual explanations. Here, we test whether wall following by cavefish is a purposeful behavior in which fish actively maintain a close relationship with the wall, or an artifactual consequence of being enclosed in a small concave arena, in which fish turn slightly to avoid the wall whenever it impedes forward movement. Wall-following abilities of fish were tested in a large, goggle-shaped arena, where forward motion along the convex wall was unimpeded. In this circumstance, cavefish continued to follow the wall at frequencies significantly above chance levels. Lateral line inactivation significantly reduced the ability of fish to follow convex, but not concave or straight, walls. Wall-following abilities of normal fish decreased with decreasing radius of wall convex curvature. Our results demonstrate that cavefish actively follow walls of varying contours. Radius-of-curvature effects coupled with the difficulties posed by convex walls to lateral line-deprived fish suggest a partially complementary use of tactile and lateral line information to regulate distance from the wall.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Feeding activity lasted for 11–24 days when food was stopped after ad libitum food availability. Restricted food during the light phase produced both food-anticipatory and light-entrainable feeding activity. Furthermore, this condition produced weak food-anticipatory and light-entrainable locomotor activity. Under the light/light (LL) condition, restricted food produced food-anticipatory feeding and locomotor activities, suggesting that a food-entrainable oscillator controls both feeding and locomotor activities. However, under the LL condition, light-entrainable feeding and locomotor activities were not observed, suggesting that a light-entrainable oscillator controls both feeding and locomotor activities. During a restricted food schedule, LD cycle shifts resulted in disrupted synchronization of feeding activity onset in three of the four fish, but one fish showed synchronized feeding activity.

The southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) is a semi-altricial seabird with a long developmental period and reversed hatching asynchrony, favouring the survival of B-chicks. We compared leucocyte counts and baseline corticosterone levels of southern rockhopper penguin chicks under different preconditions such as sex and origin from an A- or B-egg from 4 to 51 days of age. We conducted an experiment to compare leucocyte profiles and baseline corticosterone levels in A- and B-chicks in single-egg clutches as well as in B-chicks from normal two egg-clutches (one A- and one B-egg). None of these treatments influenced leucocyte counts or corticosterone levels, indicating a similar investment in the immune system. Our main finding was an increase of leucocytes/10,000 erythrocytes with age, which was mainly caused by an increase in lymphocyte numbers. This suggests differential investment into acquired immunity at this stage of development. As the granulocyte/lymphocyte (G/L) ratio did not change with age or body condition, G/L ratios seem not to reflect stress caused by poor provisioning of penguin chicks. This was also reinforced by the decrease of plasma corticosterone levels with age. Body condition was negatively correlated with monocyte numbers, suggesting a poorer health status of penguin chicks in poorer body condition.

Madagascar is a particularly challenging environment because climatic conditions seem less predictable than in comparative ecosystems in other parts of the world. We used the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) from the most unpredictable environment in Madagascar as a model to investigate the flexibility of energy saving strategies to cope with the unpredictability of their habitat. For this we measured Tsk of free-ranging mouse lemurs throughout the year using temperature data loggers. M. griseorufus showed a very strong seasonal as well as an individual flexibility in thermoregulation. During the rainy season all M. griseorufus remained normothermic. At the beginning of the dry season individuals started to exhibit different energy saving strategies: irregular short torpor bouts, regular daily torpor, prolonged torpor of a few days, and hibernation over several weeks. The accumulation of sufficient seasonal body fat was the crucial factor determining the thermal behavior of individuals. The observed intraspecific and sex independent variation in thermoregulatory patterns within one population inhabiting the same small geographical area is exceptional and gives M. griseorufus the ability to respond to current environmental as well as individual conditions.

It has never been determined whether in winter they exhibit hibernation and multi-day periods of low body temperature. The objectives of this study were to understand the winter activity pattern of H. terasensis and to examine whether it enters hibernation during winter. We monitored the skin temperature (Tsk) of nine free-ranging H. terasensis by attaching temperature-sensitive transmitters during the winters of 2007–2008 and 2008–2009. The results showed that H. terasensis entered hibernation from late December to early March. H. terasensis, however, differs from temperate hibernating bats in several ways: (1) it is capable of hibernation at roost temperature (Tr) and Tsk > 20°C; (2) hibernation at high Tr and Tsk does not lead to a relatively high arousal frequency; and (3) adults do not increase body mass in autumn prior to hibernation. To test the hypothesis that H. terasensis feeds frequently during the hibernation period to compensate for the high energetic demands of hibernating in warm hibernacula, we recorded the number and timing of bats that emerged from and entered into a hibernaculum, which contained more than 1,000 bats. From 30 December 2007 to 29 February 2008, an average of only 8.4 bats (<1%) per night (29 nights) emerged from the hibernaculum.

Some muscle groups show transitions from fast to slower myosin isoforms despite atrophy, which are not predicted from other mammalian studies of inactivity. We measure myosin protein and mRNA expression, and the mRNA expression of genes important in atrophy and metabolism in a time-course of muscle plasticity prior to, and during extended hibernation. We also investigate the role of strictly low-temperature processes by comparing torpid individuals at 20 and 4°C. Shifts in myosin isoform expression happen at both temperatures, before the onset of torpor, or within the first month of torpor, in all muscles demonstrating isoform remodeling. Skeletal muscle atrophy is greatly attenuated in this hibernating species, and even may be absent in some muscles. When present, atrophy develops early in hibernation, and does not progress in the final 3 months of torpor. Myostatin mRNA is down-regulated 50–75% in the soleus and diaphragm, two important muscles that are spared of atrophy. The transcription factor FOXO1, which spurs proteolytic degradation of contractile proteins through regulation of the ubiquitin ligase MAFbx, is also generally down-regulated, and may contribute to reduced atrophy. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) mRNA expression was reduced 50% in some muscles, while elevated more than 300% in others. Our collective findings most strongly support early, seasonal, phenotype changes in skeletal muscles which are not uniquely confined to, or prompted by, torpor at 4°C.

Consequently some (but not all) bats emit species-specific echolocation pulses. Because echolocation pulses are often intense and emitted at high rates, they are potential targets for eavesdropping by other bats. Echolocation pulses can also vary within species according to sex, body size, age, social group and geographic location. Whether these features can be recognised by other bats can only be determined reliably by playback experiments, which have shown that echolocation pulses do provide sufficient information for the identification of sex and individual in one species. Playbacks also show that bats can locate conspecifics and heterospecifics at foraging and roost sites by eavesdropping on echolocation pulses. Guilds of echolocating bat species often partition their use of pulse frequencies. Ecology, allometric scaling and phylogeny play roles here, but are not sufficient to explain this partitioning. Evidence is accumulating to support the hypothesis that frequency partitioning evolved to facilitate intraspecific communication. Acoustic character displacement occurs in at least one instance.

Pheromones (a molecule or defined combination of molecules) are species-wide signals which elicit innate responses (though responses can be conditional on development as well as context, experience, and internal state). In contrast, signature mixtures, in invertebrates and vertebrates, are variable subsets of molecules of an animal’s chemical profile which are learnt by other animals, allowing them to distinguish individuals or colonies. All signature mixtures, and almost all pheromones, whatever the size of molecules, are detected by olfaction (as defined by receptor families and glomerular processing), in mammals by the main olfactory system or vomeronasal system or both. There is convergence on a glomerular organization of olfaction. The processing of all signature mixtures, and most pheromones, is combinatorial across a number of glomeruli, even for some sex pheromones which appear to have ‘labeled lines’. Narrowly specific pheromone receptors are found, but are not a prerequisite for a molecule to be a pheromone. A small minority of pheromones act directly on target tissues (allohormone pheromones) or are detected by non-glomerular chemoreceptors, such as taste. The proposed definitions for pheromone and signature mixture are based on the heuristic value of separating these kinds of chemical information. In contrast to a species-wide pheromone, there is no single signature mixture to find, as signature mixtures are a ‘receiver-side’ phenomenon and it is the differences in signature mixtures which allow animals to distinguish each other.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We evaluated whether the digestive and locomotor systems of the alligator show parallel metabolic adjustments during thermal acclimation. To this end, we allowed juvenile alligators to grow under thermal conditions typical of winter and summer, providing them with seasonally appropriate basking opportunities. Although mean body temperatures of alligators in these groups differed by approximately 10°C, their growth and final anatomic status was equivalent. While hepatic mitochondria isolated from cold-acclimated alligators had higher oxidative capacities at 30°C than those from warm-acclimated alligators, the capacities did not differ at 20°C. Cold acclimation decreased maximal oxidative capacities of muscle mitochondria. For mitochondria from both organs and acclimation groups, palmitate increased oligomycin-inhibited respiration. GDP addition reduced palmitate-uncoupled rates more in liver mitochondria from warm- than cold-acclimated alligators. In muscle mitochondria, carboxyatractyloside significantly reduced palmitate-uncoupled rates. This effect was not changed by thermal acclimation. The aerobic capacity of liver, skeletal muscle and duodenum, as estimated by activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), increased with cold acclimation. At acclimation temperatures, the activities of COX and citrate synthase (CS) in these organs were equivalent. By measuring COX and CS in isolated mitochondria and tissue extracts, we estimated that cold acclimation did not change the mitochondrial content in liver, but increased that of muscle. The thermal compensation of growth rates and of the aerobic capacity of the locomotor and digestive systems suggests that alligators optimised metabolic processes for the seasonally altered, preferred body temperature.

The lens thickened and the anterior chamber deepened from hatching, but vitreal elongation and corneal flattening were delayed until after the first 3 days, suggesting that normal eye growth may be initially inhibited or inactive during an initial emmetropization period, and subsequently activated in response to myopic defocus arising from the continually expanding lens. Finally, when compared with published data on other chick strains, we find differences in the degree of hyperopia at hatching due to differences in lens thickness. However, the rate of ocular and vitreal expansion and the developmental changes in corneal power are similar, making the schematic eyes presented here generally applicable to different strains of chickens.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The results reported here show that in the midge C. imicola the whole abdomen, comprising the ovipositor, are endowed with three morphotypes of multiporous sensilla that display olfactory sensitivity towards kairomones related to the host-animal skin such as l-(+)-lactic acid and 1-octen-3-ol, to the host-animal urine such as 3-ethylphenol and 4-propylphenol, and to the potent attractant sesame seed oil. Electrophysiological and behavioural data for the first time suggest in the midge the involvement of abdominal olfactory structures in the choice of the oviposition sites and allow in discussing their possible role in the host-animal localisation. Field experiments showed that light traps baited with the aforementioned compounds elicited a stronger degree of attractiveness on midges with respect to the unbaited traps (control), although to a different extent. Our results, while implying a number of considerations concerning the role of molecules tested as kairomones, also suggest their use in the control of the midge C. imicola population.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We investigated directional hearing of crickets in the field using a neurophysiological approach, by recording the activity of the two prominent, bilaterally homologous AN1 neurons simultaneously in a cricket’s habitat. The discharge and latency differences of the pair of neurons in response to conspecific chirps presented at different distances and directions were taken as a measure of directional information. The maximum hearing distance differed between individuals and weather conditions from 1 to 15 m (mean 9.2 m). Although the AN1 activity generally decreased with increasing distance, large fluctuations in the magnitude of responses occurred with distance, indicating that the intensity gradient over distance is often irregular. The directional information provided in the discharge differences of the two neurons also varied with distance. Again, there was no simple directional gradient on the transmission channel; rather, with decreasing distance to the source there were receiver locations providing suprathreshold responses, but no directional information. The consequences for the ability of field crickets to communicate acoustically close to the ground are discussed.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Failing to do so will result in the perception of virtual targets that are positioned where there is no actual target. The assignment of echoes to the emitted calls can be ambiguous especially if the pulse intervals between calls are short and kept constant. Here, we present first evidence that greater mouse-eared bats deal with ambiguity by changing the pulse interval more often, in particular by reducing the number of calls in the terminal group before landing. This strategy separates virtual targets from real ones according to their change in position. Real targets will always remain in a constant position, and virtual targets will jitter back and forth according to the change in the time interval.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Glycerol must cross cell membranes in numerous processes during this time, including exit from hepatocytes where glycerol is synthesized and entry into other tissues, where glycerol is cryoprotective. Thus, we hypothesized that erythrocytes from H. chrysoscelis would be permeable to glycerol and that that permeability would be up-regulated during cold acclimation. Further, we hypothesized that glycerol permeability would be associated with the expression of aquaporins, particularly those from the glyceroporin sub-family. Erythrocytes from warm-acclimated treefrogs had high glycerol permeability at 20°C, as assessed by the time required for osmotic lysis following suspension in 0.2 M glycerol. That osmotic lysis, as well as uptake of radio-labeled glycerol, was inhibited by 0.3 mM HgCl3. Permeability assessed via osmotic lysis was markedly reduced at 5°C. These properties were similar in animals deriving from northern (Ohio) and southern (Alabama) populations, although suggestive (through statistical interactions) of greater glycerol permeability in northern animals.

To assess its nutritional value as albatross forage, we analysed S. apama for water, lipid protein, ash contents, energy density and amino acid composition. Because albatrosses consistently consume S. apama parts preferentially in the order of head, viscera and mantle, we analysed these sections separately, but did not identify any nutritional basis for this selective feeding behaviour. The gross energy value of S. apama bodies was 20.9 kJ/g dry mass, but their high water content (>83%; cf <70% for fish) results in a relatively low energy density of 3.53 kJ/g. This may contribute to a need to take large meals, which subsequently degrade flight performance. Protein content was typically >75% dry mass, whereas fat content was only about 1%. Albatrosses feed on many species of cephalopods and teleost fish, and we found the amino acid composition of S. apama to be comparable to a range of species within these taxa. We used S. apama exclusively in feeding trials to estimate the energy assimilation efficiency for Diomedea albatrosses. We estimated their nitrogen-corrected apparent energy assimilation efficiency for consuming this prey to be 81.82 ± 0.72% and nitrogen retention as 2.90 ± 0.11 g N kg−1 d−1.

While its structure, evolution, and physiological function have been studied in detail in Decapoda, there is little information on hemocyanins from other crustacean taxa. Here, we have investigated the hemocyanin of the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus, which belongs to the Stomatopoda (Hoplocarida). O. scyllarus hemocyanin forms a dodecamer (2 × 6-mer), which is composed of at least four distinct subunit types. We obtained the full-length cDNA sequences of three hemocyanin subunits, while a fourth cDNA was incomplete at its 5′ end. The complete full-length cDNAs of O. scyllarus hemocyanin translate into polypeptides of 650–662 amino acids, which include signal peptides of 16 or 17 amino acids. The predicted molecular masses of 73.1–75.1 kDa correspond well with the main hemolymph proteins detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using various anti-hemocyanin antibodies. Phylogenetic analyses show that O. scyllarus hemocyanins belong to the β-type of malacostracan hemocyanin subunits, which diverged from the other subunits before the radiation of the malacostracan subclasses around 520 million years ago.

The changes in physiology, morphology and behaviour are controlled by the photoneuroendocrine system that, as a first step, translates day lengths into a hormonal signal (melatonin). Decoding of the humoral melatonin signal, i.e. responses on the cellular level to slight alterations in signal duration, represents the prerequisite for appropriate timing of winter acclimatization in photoperiodic animals. Corresponding to the diversity of affected traits, several hormone systems are involved in the regulation downstream of the neural integration of photoperiodic time measurement. Results from recent studies provide new insights into seasonal control of reproduction and energy balance. Most intriguingly, the availability of thyroid hormone within hypothalamic key regions, which is a crucial determinant of seasonal transitions, appears to be regulated by hormone secretion from the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland. This proposed neuroendocrine pathway contradicts the common view of the pituitary as a gland that acts downstream of the hypothalamus. In the present overview of (neuro)endocrine mechanisms underlying seasonal acclimatization, we are focusing on the dwarf hamster Phodopus sungorus (long-day breeder) that is known for large amplitudes in seasonal changes. However, important findings in other mammalian species such as Syrian hamsters and sheep (short-day breeder) are considered as well.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Accordingly, dung beetles typically roll along a straight-line path away from the pile, this being the most effective escape strategy for transporting dung to a suitable burial site. In this study, we investigate how individual diurnal dung beetles, Scarabaeus (Kheper) nigroaeneus, select the compass bearing of their straight-line rolls. In particular, we examine whether roll bearings are constant with respect to geographic cues, celestial cues, or other environmental cues (such as wind direction). Our results reveal that the roll bearings taken by individual beetles are not constant with respect to geographic or celestial references. Environmental cues appear to have some influence over bearing selection, although the relationship is not strong. Furthermore, the variance in roll bearing that we observe is not affected by the presence or absence of other beetles. Thus, rather than being constant for individual beetles, bearing selection varies each time a beetle makes a ball and rolls it away from the dung pile. This strategy allows beetles to make an efficient escape from the dung pile while minimizing the chance of encountering competition.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In dual-choice cotton leaf disk and pepper fruit disk arena assays, caterpillars reared on a normal artificial diet were strongly deterred by strychnine and strophanthin-K. However, caterpillars reared on an artificial diet containing strychnine were insensitive to strychnine and strophanthin-K. Similarly, caterpillars reared on an artificial diet containing strophanthin-K were also desensitized to both deterrent chemicals. Electrophysiological tests revealed that the deterrent-sensitive neurons in taste sensilla on the maxillae of caterpillars reared on each deterrent-containing diet displayed reduced sensitivity to the two chemicals compared with the caterpillars reared on normal diets. We conclude that the experience-dependent behavioral plasticity was partly based on the reduced sensitivity of taste receptor neurons and that the desensitization of taste receptor neurons contributed to the cross-habituation to the two chemicals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In the vomeronasal organ, several receptors—in contrast to the main olfactory receptors—are sensitive to volatile or nonvolatile molecules. In a similar manner to the main olfactory epithelium, the vomeronasal organ is sensitive to common odorants and pheromones. Each accessory olfactory bulb receives input from the ipsilateral vomeronasal organ, but its activity is modulated by centrifugal projections arising from other brain areas. The processing of vomeronasal stimuli in the amygdala involves contributions from the main olfactory system, and results in long-lasting responses that may be related to the activation of the hypothalamic–hypophyseal axis over a prolonged timeframe. Different brain areas receive inputs from both the main and the accessory olfactory systems, possibly merging the stimulation of the two sensory organs to originate a more complex and integrated chemosensory perception.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Approximately 25% of neurons tuned to the echolocation pulse respond exclusively to downward FM sweeps. This review focuses on the finding that this selectivity is generated by multiple mechanisms that may act alone or in concert. In the inferior colliculus, selectivity for sweep rate is shaped by at least three mechanisms: shortpass or bandpass tuning for signal duration, delayed high-frequency inhibition that prevents responses to slow sweep rates, and asymmetrical facilitation that occurs only when two tones are presented at appropriate delays. When acting alone, the three mechanisms can produce essentially identical rate selectivity. Direction selectivity can be produced by two mechanisms: an early low-frequency inhibition that prevents responses to upward sweeps, and the same asymmetrical two-tone inhibition that shapes rate tuning. All mechanisms except duration tuning are also present in the auditory cortex. Discussion centers on whether these mechanisms are redundant or complementary.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These responses were originally believed to arise from background levels of actomyosin binding. Discovery of giant sarcomere-spanning proteins suggested muscle passive responses could arise from length changes of elastic domains present in these proteins. However, direct evidence that actomyosin plays little role in passive muscle force responses to imposed length changes has not been provided. We show here that a poison of actomyosin interaction, thiourea, does not alter initial force changes or subsequent relaxations of lobster stomatogastric muscles. These data provide direct evidence that background actomyosin cross-bridge formation likely plays, at most, a small role in muscle passive responses to length changes. Thiourea does not alter lobster muscle electrical responses to motor nerve stimulation, although in this species it does cause tonic motor nerve firing. This firing limits the utility of thiourea to study lobster muscle electrical responses to motor nerve stimulation. However, it is unclear whether thiourea induces such motor nerve firing in other animals. Thiourea may therefore provide a convenient technique to measure muscle electrical responses to motor nerve input without the confounding difficulties caused by muscle contraction.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Previous work has shown that white-bellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala) are unable to maintain energy balance on extremely dilute sucrose diets without salts (e.g. <0.25 mol l−1), and that they lose more electrolytes (i.e. Na+ and K+) via cloacal fluid on these diets than on more concentrated diets. Using white-bellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) we tested the effect of adding electrolytes to a 0.1 mol l−1 sucrose diet, by including equimolar NaCl and KCl at concentrations from 5 to 40 mmol l−1 and the individual salts at 20 mmol l−1. Addition of salts enabled both species to drink significantly more of the 0.1 mol l−1 sucrose diet than in the absence of salts, and mass loss during the experiment was reduced when salt was included. The larger honeyeaters may be more susceptible to electrolyte depletion than the smaller sunbirds. On 20 mmol l−1 combined salts, both sunbirds and honeyeaters consumed eight times their body mass in fluid daily. KCl alone had no effect. Birds are thus limited in their consumption of extremely dilute diets by increasing losses of Na+. This was confirmed by measuring plasma Na+ levels, which decreased in both species in the absence of dietary Na+. In addition, sucrose assimilation efficiencies were slightly, but significantly lower when sunbirds were fed salt-free diet, while glucose levels in ureteral urine remained extremely low. It is concluded that Na+ depletion on very dilute salt-free diets does not affect Na+-glucose transport activity in the kidney, but interferes with sugar digestion and/or assimilation in the intestine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The present paper addresses call use in Megaderma lyra, a species with a short, broadband multiharmonic basic call, in typical orientation situations, when emerging from and re-entering a day roost, in cruising flight and when passing through vegetation, and during the pursuit of tethered, flying insects. While call duration and emission rate were adapted to the four orientation situations, call spectral composition was similar in these situations, except that bats emitted calls containing more harmonics when re-entering the roost. These moderate call modifications may be accounted for by the observation that M. lyra stayed close to landscape elements even in open habitats. Although M. lyra is a typical gleaner, all tested bats approached flying insects, guided by sonar calls of significantly decreasing duration and pulse interval, and of increasing sweep rate. Before capture, peak frequency was lowered from call to call.

Each of these features could potentially influence acid–base regulation during respiratory acidosis either by facilitating or constraining HCO3− accumulation, respectively. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated the capacity of P. notatus to regulate blood acid–base status during exposure to increasing levels of hypercapnia (nominally 1–5% CO2). Fish exhibited a well-developed ability to increase plasma HCO3− levels with values of 39.8 ± 2.8 mmol l−1 being achieved at the most severe stage of hypercapnic exposure (arterial blood PCO2 = 21.9 ± 1.7 mmHg). Consequently, blood pH, while lowered by 0.15 units (pH = 7.63 ± 0.06) during the final step of hypercapnia, was regulated far above values predicted by chemical buffering (predicted pH = 7.0). The accumulation of plasma HCO3− during hypercapnia was associated with marked increases in branchial net acid excretion (JNETH+) owing exclusively to increases in the titratable alkalinity component; total ammonia excretion was actually reduced during hypercapnia. The increase in JNETH+ was accompanied by increases in branchial carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzymatic activity (2.8×) and CA protein levels (1.6×); branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity was unaffected. Rectal fluids sampled from control fish contained on average HCO3− concentrations of 92.2 ± 4.8 mmol l−1. At the highest level of hypercapnia, rectal fluid HCO3− levels were increased significantly to 141.8 ± 7.4 mmol l−1 but returned to control levels during post-hypercapnia recovery (96.0 ± 13.2 mmol l−1). Thus, the impressive accumulation of plasma HCO3− to compensate for hypercapnic acidosis occurred against a backdrop of increasing intestinal HCO3− excretion. Based on in vitro measurements of intestinal base secretion in Ussing chambers, it would appear that P. notatus did not respond by minimizing base loss during hypercapnia; the increases in base flux across the intestinal epithelium in response to alterations in serosal HCO3− concentration were similar in preparations obtained from control or hypercapnic fish.

The pneumostome closure response is part of the defense reaction in Lymnaea. The shadow or ‘light-off’ stimulus elicits activity in a higher order interneuron, RPeD11, which has a major role in mediating defensive withdrawal behavior elicited by noxious or threatening stimuli. Here, we tested our hypothesis that cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are involved in the dermal photoreceptor-mediated transduction of the shadow stimulus. The response to the shadow stimulus recorded in RPeD11 was abolished by 500 μM cis-diltiazem, which blocks cGMP-activated conductance of CNG channels. On the other hand, the shadow response elicited in RPeD11 was not blocked by 2-amino ethyldiphenyl borate (2-APB), a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel blocker. Consistent with the electrophysiologic data, cis-diltiazem blocked the shadow-evoked withdrawal response, whereas 2-APB did not block the withdrawal response evoked by the shadow stimulus in intact freely behaving Lymnaea. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the second messenger in dermal photoreceptors involves CNG and not TRP channels.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The model suggests that ammonia transport occurs via Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins and is facilitated by gill boundary layer acidification attributable to the hydration of CO2 and H+ efflux by Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE-2) and H+-ATPase. The latter two mechanisms of boundary layer acidification would occur in conjunction with Na+ influx (through a Na+ channel energized by H+-ATPase and directly via NHE-2). Here, we show that natural ammonia loading via feeding increases branchial mRNA expression of Rh genes, NHE-2, and H+-ATPase, as well as H+-ATPase activity in juvenile trout, similar to previous findings with ammonium salt infusions and high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure. The associated increase in ammonia excretion occurs in conjunction with a fourfold increase in Na+ influx after a meal. When exposed to HEA (1.5 mmol/l NH4HCO3 at pH 8.0), both unfed and fed trout showed differential increases in mRNA expression of Rhcg2, NHE-2, and H+-ATPase, but H+-ATPase activity remained at control levels. Unfed fish exposed to HEA displayed a characteristic reversal of ammonia excretion, initially uptaking ammonia, whereas fed fish (4 h after the meal) did not show this reversal, being able to immediately excrete ammonia against the gradient imposed by HEA. Exposure to HEA also led to a depression of Na+ influx, demonstrating that ammonia excretion can be uncoupled from Na+ influx. We suggest that the efflux of H+, rather than Na+ influx itself, is critical to the facilitation of ammonia excretion.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Pronounced seasonal differences in song behavior and in the morphology and physiology of the neural circuit underlying song production are well documented in many songbird species. Androgenic and estrogenic hormones largely mediate these seasonal changes. Although much work has focused on the hormonal mechanisms underlying seasonal plasticity in songbird vocal production, relatively less work has investigated seasonal and hormonal effects on songbird auditory processing, particularly at a peripheral level. We addressed this issue in Gambel’s white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), a highly seasonal breeder. Photoperiod and hormone levels were manipulated in the laboratory to simulate natural breeding and non-breeding conditions. Peripheral auditory function was assessed by measuring the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) of males and females in both conditions. Birds exposed to breeding-like conditions demonstrated elevated thresholds and prolonged peak latencies when compared with birds housed under non-breeding-like conditions. There were no changes in DPOAEs, however, which indicates that the seasonal differences in ABRs do not arise from changes in hair cell function. These results suggest that seasons and hormones impact auditory processing as well as vocal production in wild songbirds.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Could a similar strategy be utilized by the elaterids (click beetles), which have one ventral abdominal and two dorsal prothoracic lanterns? Spectral sensitivity [S(λ)] and bioluminescence were investigated in four Brazilian click beetle species Fulgeochlizus bruchii, Pyrearinus termitilluminans, Pyrophorus punctatissimus and P. divergens, representing three genera. In addition, in situ microspectrophotometric absorption spectra were obtained for visual and screening pigments in P. punctatissimus and P. divergens species. In all species, the electroretinographic S(λ) functions showed broad peaks in the green with a shoulder in the near-ultraviolet, suggesting the presence of short- and long-wavelength receptors in the compound eyes. The long-wavelength receptor in Pyrophorus species is mediated by a P540 rhodopsin in conjunction with a species-specific screening pigment. A correspondence was found between green to yellow bioluminescence emissions and its broad S(λ) maximum in each of the four species. It is hypothesized that in elaterids, bioluminescence of the abdominal lantern is an optical signal for intraspecifc sexual communication, while the signals from the prothoracic lanterns serve to warn predators and may also provide illumination in flight.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Recent work suggests urea can indeed act as a metabolic depressant during dormancy in a number of taxonomically diverse species of ectotherms. The mechanisms by which urea exerts its hypometabolic effect are unknown, but potentially stem from inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. We isolated mitochondria from Rana sylvatica skeletal muscle, an organ that is metabolically responsive to urea, and measured respiration rates in the absence or presence of 80 mmol l−1 urea in the respiration medium. Because the effect of urea may be influenced by the intracellular milieu, in these experiments we varied substrate (pyruvate or palmitoylcarnitine), temperature (4, 10, or 15°C), and pH (6.8 or 7.4). Oxygen consumption of control and urea-treated mitochondria was sensitive to each of these variables, but neither state 3 nor state 4 respiration was reduced by urea treatment and, to the contrary, urea treatment slightly increased state 4 respiration at higher test temperatures. Although we did not test the efficacy of other incubation times or urea concentrations, the outcome of our experiment intimates that the urea-induced hypometabolism observed in hibernating R. sylvatica results from inhibition of energy-utilizing processes elsewhere in the cell, rather than a direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Future investigation into urea’s effects on non-mitochondrial metabolic pathways is necessary to uncover the mechanisms by which urea depresses metabolic rate.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Important questions remain about the taxonomic distribution of multi-second adaptation and its possible roles in hearing. It has been hypothesized that neural adaptation could explain the gradual “build-up” of auditory stream segregation. We investigated the influence of several stimulus-related factors on neural adaptation in the avian homologue of mammalian A1 (field L2) in starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We presented awake birds with sequences of repeated triplets of two interleaved tones (ABA–ABA–…) in which we varied the frequency separation between the A and B tones (ΔF), the stimulus onset asynchrony (time from tone onset to onset within a triplet), and tone duration. We found that stimulus onset asynchrony generally had larger effects on adaptation compared with ΔF and tone duration over the parameter range tested. Using a simple model, we show how time-dependent changes in neural responses can be transformed into neurometric functions that make testable predictions about the dependence of the build-up of stream segregation on various spectral and temporal stimulus properties.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We predicted that nocturnal lizards, which are active at much lower environmental temperatures than diurnal lizards, would also have higher metabolic rates at low temperatures, and by association a lower thermal sensitivity (Q10) than diurnal and crepuscular lizards. We measured the rate of oxygen consumption ($$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2} $$) of eight cool-temperate species of lizard (four nocturnal, three diurnal, and one crepuscular) at 13 and 26°C and analyzed log transformations of these data using log mass as a covariate. As expected, $$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2} $$ was positively correlated with temperature in all eight species, with $$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2} $$ being two to four times higher at 26°C than at 13°C. As predicted, at 13°C (but not 26°C) the $$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2} $$ was significantly higher in nocturnal than diurnal lizards. Species-specific differences and mass scaling factors explain the patterns of thermal sensitivity seen among these eight lizard species. Thermal sensitivity is strongly influenced by mass, with smaller species generally having higher thermal sensitivity of their metabolic rate, and this result deserves further exploration among other ectotherms. We conclude that, along with the previously reported lower cost of locomotion found in nocturnal lizards, they also partially offset the thermal handicap of activity at low body temperatures by having an elevated $$ \dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2} $$ at lower temperatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Nitric oxide (NO) has previously been demonstrated to be involved in the activation of the buccal rhythm. Here, we found that NO-generating substances (SNP and SNAP) activated the buccal rhythm while slowing the endogenous rhythm of B2 bursters. The inhibitor of NO-synthase, L-NNA, the NO scavenger PTIO, or the inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, ODQ, each produced opposite, depolarising effects on the B2 neuron. In isolated B2 cells, only depolarising effects of substances interfering with NO production or function (PTIO, L-NNA and ODQ) were detected, whereas the NO donors had no hyperpolarising effects. However, when an isolated B2 cell was placed close to its initial position in the ganglion, hyperpolarising effects could be obtained with NO donors. This indicates that extrasynaptic release of some unidentified factor(s) mediates the hyperpolarising effects of NO donors on the B2 bursters. The results suggest that NO is involved in coordination between the radula and foregut movements and that the effects of NO are partially mediated by the volume chemical neurotransmission of as yet unknown origin.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It has been hypothesized that brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) females may locate or determine the quality of potential hosts by eavesdropping on their sexual signals. This is expected to produce different sex-specific pressures on the auditory system to detect conspecific and heterospecific acoustic signals. Here, we examined auditory filter shape and efficiency, which influence the ability to resolve spectral and temporal information, in males and females at center frequencies of 2, 3 and 4 kHz. We found that overall, cowbirds had relatively wide filters (lsmean ± SE: 619.8 ± 41.6 Hz). Moreover, females had narrower filters (females: 491.4 ± 66.8, males: 713.8 ± 67.3 Hz) and greater filter efficiency (females: 59.0 ± 2.0, males: 69.8 ± 1.9 dB) than males. Our results suggest that the filters of female cowbirds may allow them to extract spectral information from heterospecific vocalizations. The broader auditory filters of males may reflect limited spectral energy in conspecific vocalizations in this frequency range, and hence, weaker selection for high resolution of frequency in the range of 2–4 kHz.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Using computational tools, we explore how Ca2+-dependent mechanisms underlying selective attention can contribute to such differences in amplitude modulation sensitivity. For omega neuron 1 (ON1), selective attention is mediated by Ca2+-dependent feedback: [Ca2+]internal increases with excitation, activating a Ca2+-dependent after-hyperpolarizing current. We propose that Ca2+ removal rate and the size of the after-hyperpolarizing current can determine ON1’s temporal modulation transfer function (TMTF). This is tested using a conductance-based simulation calibrated to responses in vivo. The model shows that parameter values that simulate responses to single pulses are sufficient in simulating responses to modulated stimuli: no special modulation-sensitive mechanisms are necessary, as high and low-pass portions of the TMTF are due to Ca2+-dependent spike frequency adaptation and post-synaptic potential depression, respectively. Furthermore, variance in the two biophysical parameters is sufficient to produce TMTFs of varying bandwidth, shifting amplitude modulation sensitivity like that in different species and in response to different carrier frequencies. Thus, the hypothesis that the size of after-hyperpolarizing current and the rate of Ca2+ removal can affect amplitude modulation sensitivity is computationally validated.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These reductions are characteristic of torpor, which is temporally confined to winter. Hibernators including ground squirrels are heterothermic in winter, cycling between multiday periods of torpor with low Tb and brief periods of rewarming. In contrast, ground squirrels remain homeothermic during summer, like non-hibernating mammals. The transition between the homeothermic and heterothermic phases of the circannual rhythm of hibernation is often overlooked in hibernation studies. Here, we examined the use of torpor throughout the fall transition in laboratory-housed 13-lined ground squirrels by recording core body temperature with an implanted data logger. As is typical of laboratory-based hibernation studies, animals were kept in standard housing prior to being moved into a cold, dark room to simulate natural hibernation conditions. Significantly, the vast majority of both male and female ground squirrels expressed torpor in the fall while still housed conventionally and prior to cold exposure. The expression of torpor was not predicted by body weight or age, rather it appears to be preprogrammed in a time-dependent manner that is independent of, yet enhanced by, environmental cues. The timing and duration of these torpor bouts occurring prior to cold exposure were also remarkably sporadic. Thus, it is not possible to know with certainty which animals are torpor-naive before cold exposure in the absence of continuous measurement of body temperature. We conclude that fall animals encompass variable points in the transition between summer and winter phases of the circannual cycle of hibernation, thereby confounding studies in which they are used as non-hibernating controls. Conversely, these fall transition animals offer unique opportunities to define the molecular changes that accompany and enable hibernation.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The most conspicuous features are the directionally sensitive facial ruff and the asymmetrically arranged ears. The frequency-specific influence of these features on sound has consequences for sound localization that might differ between low and high frequencies. Whereas the high-frequency range (>3 kHz) is well investigated, less is known about the characteristics of head-related transfer functions for frequencies below 3 kHz. In the present study, we compared 1/3 octaveband-filtered transfer functions of barn owls with center frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 9 kHz. The range of interaural time differences was 600 μs at frequencies above 4 kHz, decreased to 505 μs at 3 kHz and increased again to about 615 μs at lower frequencies. The ranges for very low (0.5–1 kHz) and high frequencies (5–9 kHz) were not statistically different. Interaural level differences and monaural gains increased monotonically with increasing frequency. No systematic influence of the body temperature on the measured localization cues was observed.

Given their impact on human and agricultural health, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying immunocompetence in this reservoir host. To date, few studies have examined immune function in the Order Chiroptera, particularly among natural colonies of bats. The phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin test has been widely used to measure delayed-type cellular immune response in a wide variety of vertebrates, and has been routinely employed in immunoecological studies. Although this test is frequently described as a measure of T cell proliferation, recent studies indicate it may represent a combination of immune responses. In mammals, the immune response is differentially, temporally and spatially regulated, therefore, we characterized the infiltrating leukocyte response to the PHA skin test in bats by examining a time-series of histological sections from PHA and saline injection areas in 41 Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Results suggest that bats exhibit diverse leukocyte traffic within 6 h, and up to 24 h following subcutaneous PHA injection. There was a significant presence of lymphocytes and neutrophils, as well as eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages observed in the PHA-injected tissues, compared with saline-injected control tissues. We observed a highly significant negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in PHA-injected tissue, with peak lymphocyte response at 12 h, and peak neutrophil response at 24 h post-injection.

Over the past several decades, scientists have repeatedly debated whether human sex ratios also significantly deviate toward one sex or the other based on environmental or social conditions. An increasing number of studies supports the idea that exposure to stressful conditions can influence the sexes of offspring produced by humans, a majority of which document significantly fewer males after exposure to adverse conditions such as severe life events, economic disruption, or natural disasters. From a comparative standpoint, these findings are similar to studies in non-human mammals and other vertebrate species showing a bias toward females during times of stress. However, the mechanisms by which stress-related biases in the offspring sex ratio may occur remain elusive, and the involvement of glucocorticoids indicating a true influence of stress itself remains unstudied. Here, I review the evidence that stressful events induce sex ratio adjustment in humans. Additionally, I discuss the possibility for glucocorticoid mediation of sex ratio adjustment and the potential reproductive stages during which stress-induced sex ratio adjustment may occur in humans and other mammals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Subsequent analyses indicated that differential phosphorylation of G6PDH between the two states was responsible for the altered kinetic properties. Thus, two differentially charged forms of G6PDH were resolved by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography and, compared with controls, the proportion of G6PDH activity in peak I decreased and in peak II increased in liver from frozen frogs. G6PDH in peak I had a Km G6P of 94.1 ± 1.1 μM and Km NADP+ of 61.2 ± 3.5 μM, whereas Peak II G6PDH showed higher values (Km G6P was 172 ± 4.3 μM, Km NADP+ was 98.2 ± 3.3 μM).

First, we examined the respiratory bursts before and after a midline or para-midline transection which spared the caudal raphe nuclei: the raphe obscurus and raphe pallidus. After a midline transection, the respiratory bursts in both half-slices were desynchronized and had slightly decreased amplitudes and frequencies. After a para-midline transection, the bursts continued with similar frequencies in the half slice containing the raphe obscurus and raphe pallidus. Second, to analyze the effects of modulation by the raphe obscurus and raphe pallidus, a dorsal or ventral midline lesion was used to damage either the raphe obscurus or raphe pallidus. After a dorsal lesion, the synchronized respiratory bursts persisted with slightly decreased frequencies. In contrast, after a ventral lesion, the bursts were almost completely abolished, but recovered significantly after the addition of 5-HT. The present results demonstrated that the pre-Bötzinger complex on each side of the medulla can independently generate rhythmic respiratory activity.

Several amphibian pheromones have been behaviorally, biochemically and molecularly identified. These pheromones are typically peptides or proteins. Study of pheromone evolution in plethodontid salamanders has revealed that courtship pheromones have been subject to continual evolutionary change, perhaps as a result of co-evolution between the pheromonal ligand and its receptor. Pheromones are detected by the vomeronasal organ and main olfactory epithelium. Chemosensory neurons express vomeronasal receptors or olfactory receptors. Frogs have relatively large numbers of vomeronasal receptors that are transcribed in both the vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium. Salamander vomeronasal receptors apparently are restricted to the vomeronasal organ. To date, no chemosensory ligands have been matched to vomeronasal receptors or olfactory receptors so it is unknown whether particular receptor types are (1) specialized for detection of pheromones versus other chemosignals, or (2) specialized for detection of volatile, nonvolatile, or water-borne chemosignals. Despite progress in understanding amphibian pheromonal communication, only a small fraction of amphibian species have been examined. Study of additional species of amphibians will indicate which traits related to pheromonal communication are evolutionarily conserved and which traits have diverged over time.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We developed a method of response waveform comparison (RWC) for evaluating the effective intensity of the light pulses. We identified one UV, four violet-blue, two green and two red photoreceptor classes. We estimated the peak wavelengths of four rhodopsins to be at about 360, 420, 460 and 560 nm. The four violet-blue classes are presumably based on combinations of two rhodopsins and a violet-absorbing screening pigment. The green classes have reduced sensitivity in the ultraviolet range. The two red classes have primary peaks at about 650 and 665 nm, respectively, and secondary peaks at about 480 nm. The shift of the main peak, so far the largest amongst insects, is presumably achieved by tuning the effective thickness of the red perirhabdomal screening pigment. Polarisation sensitivity of green and red photoreceptors is higher at the secondary than at the main peak. We found a 20-fold variation of sensitivity within the cells of one green class, implying possible photoreceptor subfunctionalisation.

During prey capture, external prey properties, including size and mobility, are likely some of the most important components in predator–prey interactions. Whereas prey size has been demonstrated to elicit modulation of jaw movements during capture, how prey speed affects the approach and capture of prey remains unknown. We quantified the kinematics associated with movements of both the feeding and locomotor systems during prey capture in a lizard, Gerrhosaurus major, while facing prey differing in size and mobility (newborn mice, grasshoppers, and mealworms). Our data show that the feeding and locomotor systems were recruited differently in response to changes in the size or speed of the prey. The timing of jaw movements and of the positioning of the head are affected by changes in prey size—and speed, to a lesser extent. Changes in prey speed resulted in concomitant changes in the speed of strike and an early and greater elevation of the neck. External prey properties, and prey mobility in particular, are relevant in predator–prey interactions and elicit specific responses in different functional systems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The present study of metabolic patterns and molecular stress responses during cold exposure was carried out to investigate this “disease”, in light of the recent concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance. The metabolic profile of fuel oxidation was examined by determining the activities of the enzymes hexokinase (HK), aldolase (Ald), pyruvate kinase (PK), l-lactate dehydrogenase (l-LDH), citrate synthase (CS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) in heart, red and white muscle after exposure to temperatures of 10, 14 and 18°C. Especially, the increase in LDH activity combined with the accumulation of l-lactate in tissues indicates that temperatures below 14°C are critical for Sparus aurata and stimulate the anaerobic component of metabolism. Increase in the activity of HOAD suggests that oxidation of free fatty acids might contribute to ATP turnover at low temperatures. The expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in all tissues examined revealed a cellular stress response during cooling below 18°C. In the light of winter temperatures in S. aurata cultures around 10°C, our data suggest that the fish are exposed to stressful conditions at the low end of their thermal tolerance window. These conditions likely impair the aerobic capacity of the fish, compromise the rates of growth and reproduction and may contribute to elicit pathological conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We measured body temperature using implanted data loggers, for a 1-year period, in five oryx free-living in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. As predicted for adaptive heterothermy, during hot months compared to cooler months, not only were maximum daily body temperatures higher (41.1 ± 0.3 vs. 39.7 ± 0.1°C, P = 0.0002) but minimum daily body temperatures also were lower (36.1 ± 0.3 vs. 36.8 ± 0.2°C, P = 0.04), resulting in a larger daily amplitude of the body temperature rhythm (5.0 ± 0.5 vs. 2.9 ± 0.2°C, P = 0.0007), while mean daily body temperature rose by only 0.4°C. The maximum daily amplitude of the body temperature rhythm reached 7.7°C for two of our oryx during the hot-dry period, the largest amplitude ever recorded for a large mammal. Body temperature variability was influenced not only by ambient temperature but also water availability, with oryx displaying larger daily amplitudes of the body temperature rhythm during warm-dry months compared to warm-wet months (3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 2.3 ± 0.3°C, P = 0.005), even though ambient temperatures were the same.

Although its role in regulating the adult system has been extensively investigated, the cardiovascular response to Ang II in embryonic vertebrates is relatively unknown. We investigated the potential of Ang II as a regulator of cardiovascular function in embryonic chickens, which lack central nervous system control of cardiovascular function throughout the majority of incubation. The cardiovascular response to Ang II in embryonic chickens was investigated over the final 50% of their development. Ang II produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure on each day of development studied, and the response increased in intensity as development progressed. The Ang II type-1 receptor nonspecific competitive peptide antagonist [Sar1 ile8] Ang II blocked the cardiovascular response to subsequent injections of Ang II on day 21 only. The embryonic pressure response to Ang II (hypertension only) differed from that of adult chickens, in which initial hypotension is followed by hypertension. The constant level of gene expression for the Ang II receptor, in conjunction with an increasing pressure response to the peptide, suggests that two Ang II receptor subtypes are present during chicken development. Collectively, the data indicate that Ang II plays an important role in the cardiovascular development of chickens; however, its role in maintaining basal function requires further study.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In humans, sound localization in reverberant environments is facilitated by the precedence effect, i.e., the perceptual suppression of spatial information carried by echoes. The current study addresses the question whether gerbils are a valid animal model for such complex spatial processing. Specifically, we quantify localization dominance, i.e., the fact that in the context of precedence, only the directional information of the sound which reaches the ear first dominates the perceived position of a sound source whereas directional information of the delayed echoes is suppressed. As localization dominance is known to be stimulus-dependent, we quantified the extent to which the spectral content of transient sounds affects localization dominance in the gerbil. The results reveal that gerbils show stable localization dominance across echo delays, well comparable to humans. Moreover, localization dominance systematically decreased with increasing center frequency, which has not been demonstrated in an animal before. These findings are consistent with an important contribution of peripheral-auditory processing to perceptual localization dominance. The data show that the gerbil is an excellent model to study the neural basis of complex spatial-auditory processing.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, there is now clear empirical evidence showing that olfaction is perfectly functional in birds and birds use olfactory information in a variety of ethological contexts. Although the existence of pheromones has never been formally demonstrated in this vertebrate class, different groups of birds, such as petrels, auklets and ducks have been shown to produce specific scents that could play a significant role in within-species social interactions. Behavioral experiments have indeed demonstrated that these odors influence the behavior of conspecifics. Additionally, in quail, deprivation of olfactory inputs decreases neuronal activation induced by sexual interactions with a female. It seems therefore well established that birds enjoy a functional sense of smell and a fast growing body of experimental evidence suggests that they use this channel of olfactory communication to control their social life. The unequivocal identification of an avian pheromone is, however, still ahead of us but there are now many exciting opportunities to unravel the behavioral and physiological particularities of chemical communication in birds.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Our aim in this study was to assess the long-lived Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni (Norman) as a model system to understand long-term lens clarity in terms of solubility changes that occur to crystallins. We compared the toothfish with the mammalian model cow lens, dissecting each species’ lens into a cortex and nuclear region. In addition to crystallin distribution, we also assayed fatty acid (FA) composition by negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The majority of toothfish lens crystallins from cortex (90.4%) were soluble, whereas only a third (31.8%) from the nucleus was soluble. Crystallin solubility analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots revealed that relative proportions of crystallins in both soluble and urea-soluble fractions were similar within each species examined and in agreement with previous reports for bovine lens. From our data, we found that both toothfish and cow crystallins follow patterns of insolubility that mirror each animals lens composition with more γ crystallin aggregation seen in the toothfish lens nucleus than in cow. Toothfish lens lipids had a large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids that were absent in cow resulting in an unsaturation index (IU) four-fold higher than that of cow. We identified a novel FA with a molecular mass of 267 mass units in the lens epithelial layer of the toothfish that accounted for well over 50% of the FA abundance. The unidentified lipid in the toothfish lens epithelia corresponds to either an odd-chain (17 carbons) FA or a furanoid. We conclude that long-lived fishes are likely good animal models of lens crystallin solubility and may model post-translational modifications and solubility changes better than short-lived animal models.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Oxygen in the adjacent sand, total and viable clutch sizes, air, sand and nest temperatures, and sand characters of each nest were also determined. Oxygen content was lower in late stages than in the early and middle stages. It was also lower in the middle layer than in the upper and bottom layers. Nest temperature showed opposite trends, reaching its maximum value in late stages of development. Nest oxygen content was influenced by fraction of viable eggs, total clutch sizes, sand temperatures, maximum nest temperature and maximum change in the nest temperature during incubation. Clutch size during embryogenesis was the most influential factor overall. However, the major influential factors were different for different developmental stages. In the first half of the incubation, the development rate was low, and the change in the nest oxygen content was influenced mainly by the clutch size. During the second half, the rapid embryonic development rate became the dominant factor, and hatchling activities caused even greater oxygen consumption during the last stage of development.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Functional mitochondria isolated from diapausing and developing embryos of the annual killifish exhibited VO2, respiratory control ratios (RCR), and P:O ratios consistent with those obtained from other ectothermic vertebrate species. Reduced oxygen consumption associated with dormancy in whole animal respiration rates are correlated with maximal respiration rates of mitochondria isolated from diapausing versus developing embryos. P:O ratios for developing embryos were similar to those obtained from adult liver, but were diminished in mitochondria from diapausing embryos suggesting decreased oxidative efficiency. Proton leak in adult liver corresponded with that of developing embryos but was elevated in mitochondria isolated from diapausing embryos. In metabolically suppressed diapause II embryos, over 95% of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption is accounted for by proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes correlates with diminished oxidative capacity of isolated mitochondria, especially during diapause. Respiratory complexes exhibited suppressed activity in mitochondria with the ATP synthase exhibiting the greatest inhibition during diapause II. Mitochondria isolated from diapause II embryos are not poised to produce ATP, but rather to shuttle carbon and electrons through the Kreb’s cycle while minimizing the generation of a proton motive force. This particular mitochondrial physiology is likely a mechanism to avoid production of reactive oxygen species during large-scale changes in flux through oxidative phosphorylation pathways associated with metabolic transitions into and out of dormancy and anoxia.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Workers transport fragments in an upright, slightly backwards-tilted position. To investigate how they maintain stability and control the carried fragment’s position, we measured head and fragment positions from video recordings. Load-transporting ants often fell over, demonstrating the biomechanical difficulty of this behavior. Long fragments were carried at a significantly steeper angle than short fragments of the same mass. Workers did not hold fragments differently between the mandibles, but performed controlled up and down head movements at the neck joint. By attaching additional mass at the fragment’s tip to load-carrying ants, we demonstrated that they are able to adjust the fragment angle. When we forced ants to transport loads across inclines, workers walking uphill carried fragments at a significantly steeper angle, and downhill at a shallower angle than ants walking horizontally. However, we observed similar head movements in unladen workers, indicating a generalized reaction to slopes that may have other functions in addition to maintaining stability. Our results underline the importance of proximate, biomechanical factors for the understanding of the foraging process in leaf-cutting ants.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Earlier studies in FM bats showed that a population of neurons in auditory centers above the inferior colliculus (IC) is tuned to echo delay, with different neurons tuned to different echo delays. A building block for delay-tuned responses is paradoxical latency shift (PLS), featuring longer response latencies to more intense sounds. PLS is first created in the IC, where neurons exhibit unit-specific quantum increase in response latency with increasing sound level. Other IC neurons display oscillatory discharges whose period is unit-specific and level tolerant, indicating that this is attributable to cell’s intrinsic properties. High-threshold inhibition of oscillatory discharge produces PLS, indicating that oscillatory discharge is a building block for PLS. To investigate the cellular basis of oscillatory discharges, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from IC neurons in leopard frogs (which also exhibit oscillatory discharges and PLS). These recordings show that IC neurons are heterogeneous displaying diverse biophysical phenotypes; each phenotype (and cell) has its own membrane time constant, input resistance, and strengths of Ih, Ikir, Ikv—these intrinsic properties give rise to cell-specific resonance which can be observed through current and afferent stimulations.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This leads to increases in intracellular diffusion distances that may impact the scaling with body mass of muscle metabolism. We have previously found similar negative scaling of aerobic capacity (mitochondrial volume density, Vmt) and the rate of an aerobic process (post-contractile phosphocreatine recovery) in fish WM. In the present study, we examined the scaling with body mass of oxygen consumption rates of isolated mitochondria (VO2mt) from WM in three species from different families that vary in morphology and behavior: an active, pelagic species (bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix), a relatively inactive demersal species (black sea bass, Centropristis striata), and a sedentary, benthic species (southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma). In contrast to our prior studies, the measurement of respiration in isolated mitochondria is not influenced by the diffusion of oxygen or metabolites. Vmt was measured in WM and in high-density isolates used for VO2mt measurements. WM Vmt was significantly higher in the bluefish than in the other two species and VO2mt was independent of body mass when expressed per milligram protein or per milliliter mitochondria. The size-independence of VO2mt indicates that differences in WM aerobic function result from variation in Vmt and not to changes in VO2mt. This is consistent with our prior work that indicated that while diffusion constraints influence mitochondrial distribution, the negative scaling of aerobic processes like post-contractile PCr recovery can largely be attributed to the body size dependence of Vmt.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We used permeabilised ventricle fibres to explore heart mitochondrial function in situ in three closely related species of small New Zealand triplefin fishes in response to temperature. We compared this to measures of whole animal respiration rates and critical oxygen tensions in these fishes. Bellapiscis medius, an intertidal species, had the greatest tolerance to hypoxia at higher temperatures and had more efficient OXPHOS at 30°C than the two subtidal species Forsterygion varium and F. malcolmi. B. medius also displayed the highest cytochrome c oxidase flux, which may in part explain how B. medius tolerates higher temperatures and hypoxia. Triplefin heart mitochondria exhibit decreased coupling to phosphorylation with increasing temperature.

We hypothesized that SusMR in Djungarian hamsters may be affected by the degree of prior cold acclimation and temporal patterns of Ta changes experienced by the animals, as average Ta declines. After cold-acclimation at +5°C for 6 weeks, hamsters reached rates of SusMR that were 35% higher than previously determined and were able to maintain positive energy balances down to Ta −9°C. SusMR was unaffected, however, by whether mean cold load was constant or caused by Tas cycling between +3°C and as low as −25°C, at hourly intervals. At mean Tas between +3 and −3°C hamsters significantly reduced body mass and energy expenditure, but were able to maintain stable body mass at lower Tas (−5 to −9°C). These results indicate that prior cold-acclimation profoundly affects SusMR in hamsters and that body mass regulation may play an integral part in maintaining positive energy balance during cold exposure. Because the degree of instantaneous cold load had no effect on SusMR, we hypothesize that limits to energy turnover in Djungarian hamsters are not determined by the capacity to withstand extreme temperatures (i.e., peripheral limits) but are due to central limitation of energy intake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Single unit recordings were performed from 66 units in the inferior colliculus of the anaesthetized guinea pig in response to the best frequency tone. Regularity of firing was measured by calculating the coefficient of variation as a function of time of a unit’s response. There was a positive correlation between coefficient of variation and interaural intensity difference sensitivity, indicating that highly regular units had very weak and irregular units had strong interaural intensity difference sensitivity responses. Three effects of binaural interaction on the sustained regularity were observed: constant coefficient of variation despite change in rate (66% of the units), negative (20%) and positive (13%) rate–CV relationships.

Animals with remote sensing can anticipate obstacles and make adjustments in their gait to accommodate them. It is largely unknown how animals that rely on touch might use such information to adjust their gait. One possibility is immediate (reflexive) change in motor activity. Elongated animals, however, might modulate movements by passing information from anterior to posterior segments. Using the caterpillar Manduca sexta we examined the movements of the most anterior abdominal prolegs as they approached an obstacle. The first pair of prolegs anticipated the obstacle by lifting more quickly in the earliest part of the swing phase: the caterpillar had information about the obstacle at proleg lift-off. Sometimes the prolegs corrected their trajectory mid-step. Removal of sensory hairs on the stepping leg did not affect the early anticipatory movements, but did change the distance at which the mid-step corrections occurred. We conclude that anterior sensory information can be passed backwards and used to modulate an ongoing crawl. The local sensory hairs on each body segment can then fine-tune movements of the prolegs as they approach an obstacle.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This mechanism should be challenged when required to rapidly generate forces during jumping, particularly in large spiders. However, effective use of leg muscles could facilitate rapid jumping. To quantify the contributions of different legs and leg joints, we investigated jumping kinematics by high-speed video recording. We observed two different types of jumps following a disturbance: prepared and unprepared jumps. In unprepared jumps, the animals could jump in any direction away from the disturbance. The remarkable directional flexibility was achieved by flexing the legs on the leading side and extending them on the trailing side. This behaviour is only possible for approximately radial-symmetric leg postures, where each leg can fulfil similar functions. In prepared jumps, the spiders showed characteristic leg positioning and the jumps were directed anteriorly. Immediately after a preliminary countermovement in which the centre of mass was moved backwards and downwards, the jump was executed by extending first the fourth and then the second leg pair. This sequence provided effective acceleration to the centre of mass. At least in the fourth legs, the hydraulic and the muscular mechanism seem to interact to generate ground reaction forces.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We characterized responses of campaniform sensilla, receptors that encode forces as cuticular strains, in the tarsi (feet) of cockroaches using neurophysiological techniques and digital imaging. A campaniform sensillum on the fourth tarsal segment was readily identified by its large action potential in nerve recordings. The receptor discharged to contractions of the retractor unguis muscle, which engages the pretarsus (claws and arolium) with the substrate. We mimicked the effects of muscle contractions by applying displacements to the retractor apodeme (tendon). Sensillum firing did not occur to unopposed movements, but followed engagement of the claws with an object. Vector analysis of forces suggested that resisted muscle contractions produce counterforces that axially compress the tarsal segments. Close joint packing of tarsal segments was clearly observed following claw engagement. Physiological experiments showed that the sensillum responded vigorously to axial forces applied directly to the distal tarsus. Discharges of tarsal campaniform sensilla could effectively signal active substrate engagement when the pretarsal claws and arolium are used to grip the substrate in climbing, traversing irregular terrains or walking on inverted surfaces.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We present a computational fluid dynamics model for one or more hairs, coupled to a rigid-body dynamics model, for simulating both biological (e.g., a cricket cercal hair) and artificial MEMS-based systems. The model is used to investigate hair–hair interaction between pairs of hairs and quantify the extent of so-called viscous coupling. The results show that the extent to which hairs are coupled depends on the mounting properties of the hairs and the frequency at which they are driven. In particular, it is shown that for equal length hairs, viscous coupling is suppressed when they are driven near the natural frequency of the undamped system and the damping coefficient at the base is small. Further, for certain configurations, the motion of a hair can be enhanced by the presence of nearby hairs. The usefulness of the model in designing artificial systems is discussed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Previous studies have shown that this species is able to withstand long periods of immobilisation during aestivation while apparently maintaining whole muscle mass and contractile performance. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of prolonged aestivation on the levels of metabolic enzymes (CCO, LDH and CS) in functionally distinct skeletal muscles (cruralis, gastrocnemius, sartorius, iliofibularis and rectus abdominus) and liver of C. alboguttata. CS activity was significantly reduced in all tissues except for the cruralis, gastrocnemius and the liver. LDH activity was significantly reduced in the sartorius and rectus abdominus, but remained at control (active) levels in the other tissues. CCO activity was significantly reduced in the gastrocnemius and rectus abdominus, and unchanged in the remaining tissues. Muscle protein was significantly reduced in the sartorius and iliofibularis during aestivation, and unchanged in the remaining muscles. The results suggest that the energy pathways involved in the production and consumption of ATP are remodelled during prolonged aestivation but selective. Remodelling and subsequent down-regulation of metabolic activity seem to target the smaller non-jumping muscles, while the jumping muscles retain enzyme activities at control levels during aestivation. These results suggest a mechanism by which aestivating C. alboguttata are able to maintain metabolic depression while ensuring that the functional capacity of critical muscles is not compromised upon emergence from aestivation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In contrast, embryos did not exhibit dependence upon an ambient HCO3−/CO32− source, developing and hatching in HCO3−/CO32−-free water at rates comparable to controls. Post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos exhibited a significant saturation-type calcium uptake as a function of increasing ambient calcium concentration. However, changes in ambient bicarbonate concentration did not influence calcium or apparent titratable alkalinity uptake. There was a distinct shift from no significant flux in pre-metamorphic embryos to net uptake of calcium in post-metamorphic stages as indicated by an increased uptake from the micro-environment surrounding the egg mass and increased net uptake in 24-h, whole egg mass flux measurements. Furthermore, HCO3−/CO32− acquisition as measured by titratable alkalinity flux is at least partially attributable to an endogenous carbonate source that is associated with acid extrusion. Thus, calcium requirements for embryonic shell formation are met via uptake but HCO3−/CO32−, which is also necessary for shell formation is acquired in part from endogenous sources with no detectable correlation to ambient HCO3−/CO32− availability.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To assess costs of quadrupedal locomotion for a gliding arboreal mammal, we used open-flow respirometry and a variable-speed treadmill to measure oxygen consumption and to calculate cost of transport, excess exercise oxygen consumption, and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption for nine northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and four fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). Our results indicate that oxygen consumption during exercise by flying squirrels was 1.26–1.65 times higher than predicted based on body mass, and exponentially increased with velocity (from 0.84 ± 0.03 ml O2 kg−1 s−1 at 0.40 m s−1 to 1.55 ± 0.03 ml O2 kg−1 s−1 at 0.67 m s−1). Also, cost of transport in flying squirrels increased with velocity, although excess exercise oxygen consumption and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption did not. In contrast, oxygen consumption during exercise for fox squirrels was similar to predicted, varying from 0.51 (±0.02) ml O2 kg−1 s−1 at 0.63 m s−1 to 0.54 (±0.03) ml O2 kg−1 s−1 at 1.25 m s−1. In addition, the cost of transport for fox squirrels decreased with velocity, while excess exercise oxygen consumption and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption did not. Collectively, these observations suggest that unlike fox squirrels, flying squirrels are poorly adapted to prolonged bouts of quadrupedal locomotion. The evolution of skeletal adaptations to climbing, leaping, and landing and the development of a gliding membrane likely has increased the cost of quadrupedal locomotion by >50% while resulting in energy savings during gliding and reduction in travel time between foraging patches.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The functional efficiency of the layer, however, is jeopardised by partial melting that may occur at physiological temperatures. In this study, light microscopic images of elytral prints show that the epicuticular lipid layer of the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata actually is partially liquid and chemical investigations reveal the high similarity of the epicuticular hydrocarbon pattern and the tarsal liquid. By means of chemical manipulation of the surface hydrocarbon composition of live beetles, the substance exchange between their tarsal adhesive hairs and the body surface is monitored.

Yet our understanding of flight energetics focuses mostly on continuous horizontal forward flight at intermediate speeds. Many bats, however, perform manoeuvring flights at suboptimal speeds when foraging. For example, members of the genus Rhinolophus hunt insects during short sallying flights from a perch. Such flights include many descents and ascents below minimum power speed and are therefore considered energetically more expensive than flying at intermediate speed. To test this idea, we quantified the energy costs of short manoeuvring flights (<2 min) using the Na-bicarbonate technique in two Rhinolophus species that differ in body mass but have similar wing shapes. First, we hypothesized that, similar to birds, energy costs of short flights should be higher than predicted by an equation derived for bats at intermediate speeds. Second, we predicted that R. mehelyi encounters higher flight costs than R. euryale, because of its higher wing loading. Although wing loading of R. mehelyi was only 20% larger than that of R. euryale, its flight costs (2.61 ± 0.75 W; mean ± 1 SD) exceeded that of R. euryale (1.71 ± 0.37 W) by 50%. Measured flight costs were higher than predicted for R. mehelyi, but not for R. euryale. We conclude that R. mehelyi face elevated energy costs during short manoeuvring flights due to high wing loading and thus may optimize foraging efficiency by energy-conserving perch-hunting.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we review field research conducted on fish pheromones and alarm substances, highlighting the following topics: (1) contradictory results obtained in laboratory and field experiments, (2) how environmental context and physiological status influences behavior, (3) challenges and constraints of aquatic field research and (4) innovative techniques and experimental designs that advance understanding of fish chemical ecology through field research.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

An important constraint faced by subterranean mammals is the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of the burrow atmosphere. The traits, regarded as “adaptations of rodents to hypoxia and hypercapnia”, have been evaluated in only a few subterranean species. In addition, well-studied subterranean taxa are very divergent to their sister groups, making it difficult to assess the adaptive path leading to subterranean life. The closely related sister genera Octodon and Spalacopus of Neotropical rodents offer a unique opportunity to trace the evolution of physiological mechanisms. We studied the ventilatory responses of selected octodontid rodents to selective pressures imposed by the subterranean niche under the working hypothesis that life underground, in hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, promotes convergent physiological changes. To perform this study we used the following species: Spalacopus cyanus (the subterranean coruros) and Octodon degus (the fossorial degus) from central Chile. Ventilatory tidal volume and respiratory frequency were measured in non-anaesthetized spontaneously breathing animals. Acute hypoxic challenges (O2 1–15%) and hypercapnia (CO2 10%) were induced to study respiratory strategies using non-invasive whole body pletismography techniques. Our results show that coruros have a larger ventilatory response to acute hypoxia as than degus. On the other hand, hypercapnic respiratory responses in coruros seem to be attenuated when compared to those in degus. Our results suggest that coruros and degus have different respiratory strategies to survive in the hypoxic and hypercapnic atmospheres present in their burrows.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The state of torpor represents a hypometabolic shift wherein the rate of oxygen consuming processes are strongly repressed in an effort to maintain cellular homeostasis as the availability of food energy becomes limited. We are interested in studying hibernation/torpor because of the robust state of tolerance to constrained oxygen delivery, oligemia, and hypothermia achieved by the tissues of hibernating mammals. The role of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as PKB) has been examined in torpor in previous studies. However, this is the first study that examines the level of Akt phosphorylation in the liver during the two transition phases of the hibernation cycle: entrance into torpor, and the subsequent arousal from torpor. Our results indicate that Akt is activated in the squirrel liver by phosphorylation of two key residues (Thr308 and Ser473) during entrance into torpor and arousal from torpor. Moreover, we observed increased phosphorylation of key substrates of Akt during the two transition stages of torpor. Finally, this study reports the novel finding that PRAS40, a component of the TORC1 multi-protein complex and a potentially important modulator of metabolism, is regulated during torpor.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The single published hypothesis to explain these relationships is the heat load hypothesis that states that in warm climates red knots may overheat during fuelling. To limit endogenous heat production (measurable as basal metabolic rate BMR), birds would minimize the growth of digestive organs at a time they need. This hypothesis makes the implicit assumption that BMR is mainly driven by digestive organ size variation during pre-flight fuelling. To test the validity of this assumption, we fed captive knots with trout pellet food, a diet previously shown to quickly lead to atrophied digestive organs, during a fuelling episode. Birds were exposed to two thermal treatments (6 and 24°C) previously shown to generate different fuelling rates in knots. We made two predictions. First, easily digested trout pellet food rather than hard-shelled prey removes the heat contribution of the gut and would therefore eliminate an ambient temperature effect on fuelling rate. Second, if digestive organs were the main contributors to variations in BMR but did not change in size during fuelling, we would expect no or little change in BMR in birds fed ad libitum with trout pellets. We show that cold-acclimated birds maintained higher body mass and food intake (8 and 51%) than warm-acclimated birds. Air temperature had no effect on fuelling rate, timing of fuelling, timing of peak body mass or BMR. During fuelling, average body mass increased by 32% while average BMR increased by 15% at peak of mass and 26% by the end of the experiment. Our results show that the small digestive organs characteristic of a trout pellet diet did not prevent BMR from increasing during premigratory fuelling.

We observed an overall beneficial effect of increased temperature on both structural and behavioral recovery after amputation of the caudal spinal cord. Fish kept at 30°C recovered the amplitude of the electric organ discharge at more than twice the rate observed in fish kept at 22°C, within the first 20 days post-injury. This improved recovery was supported by increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis levels in fish kept at 30°C. The high temperature appeared to have a direct inhibitory effect on apoptosis and to lead to a compression of the duration of the wave of post-lesion apoptosis. The latter effect was presumably induced through the acceleration of the metabolic rate, a phenomenon also supported by the observation that re-growth of the tail was significantly increased in fish kept at 30°C.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Male and female hamsters (n = 10 each) were submitted to an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge test, whereas animals in the control group received 0.5 mL of sterile isotonic saline solution. All feces voided by each animal were collected at 4 h intervals from 24 h before (baseline) until 48 h after injections. FGM were quantified using an 11-oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Basal concentrations of FGM were almost four times higher in males than in females. Following ACTH administration, FGM levels started rising from 8 h onwards, reaching peak concentrations 20 or 28 h post injection in males and females, respectively. Despite the much higher absolute concentrations present in males, the relative increase (500%) in response to the ACTH stimulation was similar in both sexes. Sex differences in FGM levels are in accordance with results reported by others regarding the hamster adrenal physiology. The comparison of the adrenocortical response of males and females to an ACTH challenge provided new information about the amplitude and the timing of such a response and the excretion of glucocorticoids in both sexes. We demonstrated for the first time in the Syrian hamster that adrenocortical activity can be monitored in fecal samples in a noninvasive way.

Winter is a nutritional bottleneck for northern populations, because porcupines remain active when environmental demands are high and food quality is low. We used captive porcupines to examine physiological responses to low-quality diets at high energy demands during winter at ambient temperatures as low as −39°C. We did not observe an endogenous pattern of body mass gain or loss when porcupines were fed a low nitrogen diet (1.1% dry matter) ad libitum through winter. Dry matter intake declined from 43.6 to 14.6 g kg−0.75 d−1 even though ambient temperatures declined from −3 to −30°C, which indicates a seasonal decrease in metabolic rate. Porcupines consuming white spruce needles maintained digestive efficiency for energy (61%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (50%). However, low requirements for energy (398 kJ kg−0.75 d−1) and nitrogen (209 mg kg−0.75 d−1) minimized the loss of body mass when intakes were low and plant toxins increased urinary losses of energy and nitrogen. Porcupines were also able to tolerate low intakes of sodium, even when dietary potassium loads were high. Porcupines use a flexible strategy to survive winter: low requirements are combined with a high tolerance for dietary imbalances that minimize the use of body stores when demands exceed supply. However, body stores are rapidly restored when conditions allow. Porcupines posses many physiological abilities similar to specialist herbivores, but retain the ability of a generalist to survive extreme conditions by using a variety of foods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

These peptides were selected for their vasoactive properties in addition to their reported actions on salt gland activity in birds and turtles and rectal gland activity in elasmobranchs. The femoral artery was cannulated in seven juvenile crocodiles for delivery of peptides and measurement of mean blood pressure and heart rate. In addition, secretion rate of, and blood flow to, the salt glands were recorded simultaneously using laser Doppler flowmetry. VIP stimulated salt secretion was coupled to an increase in blood flow and vascular conductance of the lingual salt glands. BNP was a potent stimulant of salt gland secretion, resulting in a maximal secretion rate of more than 15-fold higher than baseline; however, this was not coupled to an increase in perfusion rate, which remained unchanged. ANG II failed to stimulate salt gland secretion and there was a transient decrease in salt gland blood flow and vascular conductance.

Of special interest is protein synthesis located at the synapse, as this potentially confers selective synaptic modification and has been implicated in the establishment of memories. However, the underlying molecular events are largely unknown. In this review, we will first discuss novel findings that highlight the role of RNA localization in neurons. We will focus on the role of RNA localization in neurotrophin signaling, axon outgrowth, dendrite and dendritic spine morphogenesis as well as in synaptic plasticity. Second, we will briefly present recent work on the role of microRNAs in translational control in dendrites and its implications for learning and memory. Finally, we discuss recent approaches to visualize RNAs in living cells and their employment for studying RNA trafficking in neurons.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In Taiwan, the milkfish are commercially cultured in environments of various salinities. Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is a key enzyme for fish iono- and osmoregulation. When compared with gills, NKA and its potential role were less examined by different approaches in the other osmoregulatory organs (e.g., kidney) of euryhaline teleosts. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between osmoregulatory plasticity and renal NKA in this euryhaline species. Muscle water contents (MWC), plasma, and urine osmolality, kidney histology, as well as distribution, expression (mRNA and protein), and specific activity of renal NKA were examined in juvenile milkfish acclimated to fresh water (FW), seawater (SW 35‰), and hypersaline water (HSW 60‰) for at least two weeks before experiments. MWC showed no significant difference among all groups. Plasma osmolality was maintained within the range of physiological homeostasis in milkfish acclimated to different salinities, while, urine osmolality of FW-acclimated fish was evidently lower than SW- and HSW-acclimated individuals. The renal tubules were identified by staining with periodic acid Schiff’s reagent and hematoxylin. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining showed that NKA was distributed in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting tubules, but not in glomeruli, of milkfish exposed to different ambient salinities. The highest abundance of relative NKA α subunit mRNA was found in FW-acclimated milkfish rather than SW- and HSW-acclimated individuals. Furthermore, relative protein amounts of renal NKA α and β subunits as well as NKA-specific activity were also found to be higher in the FW group than SW and the HSW groups. This study integrated diverse levels (i.e., histological distribution, gene, protein, and specific activity) of renal NKA expression and illustrated the potential role of NKA in triggering ion reabsorption in kidneys of the marine euryhaline milkfish when acclimated to a hypotonic FW environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

With a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that D. cupreus exploits reflective elements also present in non-polarizing tapetal eyes of other species such as Agelena labyrinthica.

In the insects, octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin have key functions in memory formation. For Drosophila, octopamine is necessary and sufficient for appetitive olfactory memory formation. Whether octopamine plays a general role in reinforcing memories in the fly is not known. Place learning in the heat-box associates high temperatures with one part of a narrow chamber, and a cool, strongly preferred temperature with the other half of the chamber. The cool-temperature-associated chamber half could provide a rewarding stimulus to a fly, and thus a place memory is composed of an aversive and rewarded memory component. The role of octopamine in place memory was thus tested. Using a mutation in the tyramine beta hydroxylase (TβH[M18]) and blocking of evoked synaptic transmission in the octopamine (and tyramine) neurons labeled with a tyramine decarboxylase-2 (TDC2) gene regulatory elements we found that reinforcement of place memories is independent of normal octopamine signaling.

The prospects for cone-based vision in this species were examined through recordings of the electroretinogram (ERG), a commonly examined retinal response to photic stimulation. Recorded under flickering-light conditions that elicit signals from cone photoreceptors, the spectral sensitivity of the opossum eye is well accounted for by contributions from the presence of a single cone pigment having peak absorption at 561–562 nm.

In a second series of experiments, air-breathing frequency (fRA), measured in fish with access to the surface, increased with graded hypoxia.

Honeybees followed the stationary part of the floor at a given height. On encountering the moving part of the floor, which moved in the same direction as their flight, honeybees descended and flew at a lower height, thus gradually restoring their ventral optic flow (OF) to a similar value to that they had percieved when flying over the stationary part of the floor. This was therefore achieved not by increasing their airspeed, but by lowering their height of flight. These results can be accounted for by a control system called an optic flow regulator, as proposed in previous studies. This visuo-motor control scheme explains how honeybees can navigate safely along tunnels on the sole basis of OF measurements, without any need to measure either their speed or the clearance from the surrounding walls.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Tiger (3,840 g) and eastern quolls (780 g) are mesic zone species, northern quolls (516 g) are tropical zone, and chuditch (1,385 g) were once widespread through the Australian arid zone. We found that standard physiological variables of these quolls are consistent with allometric expectations for marsupials. Nevertheless, inter-specific patterns amongst the quolls are consistent with their different environments. The lower Tb of northern quolls (34°C) may provide scope for adaptive hyperthermia in the tropics, and they use torpor for energy/water conservation, whereas the larger mesic species (eastern and tiger quolls) do not appear to. Thermolability varied from little in eastern (0.035°C °C−1) and tiger quolls (0.051°C ºC−1) to substantial in northern quolls (0.100°C ºC−1) and chuditch (0.146°C ºC−1), reflecting body mass and environment. Basal metabolic rate was higher for eastern quolls (0.662 ± 0.033 ml O2 g−1 h−1), presumably reflecting their naturally cool environment. Respiratory ventilation closely matched metabolic demand, except at high ambient temperatures where quolls hyperventilated to facilitate evaporative heat loss; tiger and eastern quolls also salivated. A higher evaporative water loss for eastern quolls (1.43 ± 0.212 mg H2O g−1 h−1) presumably reflects their more mesic distribution. The point of relative water economy was low for tiger (−1.3°C), eastern (−12.5°C) and northern (+3.3) quolls, and highest for the chuditch (+22.6°C). We suggest that these differences in water economy reflect lower expired air temperatures and hence lower respiratory evaporative water loss for the arid-zone chuditch relative to tropical and mesic quolls.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We studied the thermal biology and activity patterns of free-ranging kaluta (~27 g), a dasyurid restricted to these tropical spinifex deserts, during the Austral winter (June–July) and in addition quantified activity patterns in captivity. Unlike most dasyurids, wild and captive kalutas were almost exclusively diurnal and retreated into underground burrows during the night. Despite being active during the warmer part of the day, kalutas entered torpor daily. However, torpor patterns differed remarkably between males and females. While females spent most of the night torpid at body temperatures (Tb) as low as 21°C, close to soil temperature, males entered multiple short and shallow bouts (Tb > 25°C) during the night. Males also maintained higher Tbs during the early morning when active, occupied larger home ranges and covered greater distances while foraging than females. Hence, males appear to expend more energy than the similar-sized females both while foraging and during the rest phase. We propose that physiological as well as behavioural preparations for the September mating season that culminate in a complete male die-off might already impose energetic costs on males during winter.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It is believed to have evolved in the basal actinopterygian lineage of fishes, species that lack the intracellular pH (pHi) protection mechanism of more derived species’ red blood cells (i.e., adrenergically activated Na+/H+ exchangers; βNHE). These basal actinopterygians may consequently experience a reduction in blood O2 carrying capacity, and thus O2 uptake at the gills, during hypoxia- and exercise-induced generalized blood acidoses. We analyzed the hemoglobins (Hbs) of seven species within this group [American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula), bowfin (Amia calva), mooneye (Hiodon tergisus), and pirarucu (Arapaima gigas)] for their Root effect characteristics so as to test the hypothesis of the Root effect onset pH value being lower than those pH values expected during a generalized acidosis in vivo. Analysis of the haemolysates revealed that, although each of the seven species displayed Root effects (ranging from 7.3 to 40.5% desaturation of Hb with O2, i.e., Hb O2 desaturation), the Root effect onset pH values of all species are considerably lower (ranging from pH 5.94 to 7.04) than the maximum blood acidoses that would be expected following hypoxia or exercise (pHi 7.15–7.3). Thus, although these primitive fishes possess Hbs with large Root effects and lack any significant red blood cell βNHE activity, it is unlikely that the possession of a Root effect would impair O2 uptake at the gills following a generalized acidosis of the blood. As well, it was shown that both maximal Root effect and Root effect onset pH values increased significantly in bowfin over those of the more basal species, toward values of similar magnitude to those of most of the more derived teleosts studied to date. This is paralleled by the initial appearance of the choroid rete in bowfin, as well as a significant decrease in Hb buffer value and an increase in Bohr/Haldane effects, together suggesting bowfin as the most basal species capable of utilizing its Root effect to maximize O2 delivery to the eye.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To track changes in individual physiological state we analysed blood metabolite concentrations in breeding common terns Sterna hirundo. We selected birds to contrast sex, breeding experience, sampling year and nutritional state and collected repeated samples from individuals during incubation. Unlike cholesterol, triglyceride and uric acid levels strongly correlated with nutritional state. While cholesterol levels in males remained stable throughout incubation, comparatively lower levels were measured in females directly after egg-laying. In 2006, only highly experienced females showed increased cholesterol concentrations by mid-incubation, whereas less experienced females maintained reduced levels and were apparently unable to recover. In 2007, all females showed an increase in cholesterol by mid-incubation. Triglyceride levels did not differ between sexes, but concentrations were significantly higher in more experienced birds and were overall higher in 2007 than in 2006. Uric acid concentrations did not differ significantly. The variation in cholesterol and triglyceride levels can be explained by differences in foraging conditions, as food abundance, onset of breeding and mean clutch size indicate 2007 to be the superior year.

In this study, I compared the egg quality (egg size, albumen and yolk antioxidant capacity) and serum oxidative status (oxidative damage, total serum antioxidant capacity, and serum thiols) of female pigeons (Columba livia) fed with foods of different quality (standard quality and decreased quality). I also analysed the patterns of covariation among egg and female traits. The study focussed on the first clutch laid by the female in the breeding season and on the short-term effects of a decrease in diet quality. The treatment did not affect the egg volume, the lipophilic and hydrophilic components of antioxidant capacity (lipOXY and hydrOXY, respectively) or the antioxidant capacity of the albumen (albumOXY). However, females fed a higher quality diet were fatter and had marginally higher values of serum hydroperoxides (oxidative damage) than females fed a lower quality diet. Moreover, females that showed an increase in yolk hydrOXY and serum hydroperoxides also showed a decrease in yolk lipOXY, albumOXY and serum antioxidant capacity. These results show that the female’s oxidative status can be correlated with the antioxidant content of her eggs, but the nature of these correlations is complex, depending on the molecular component measured. The results also suggest that in the pigeon the deposition of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in the egg may trade off against each other.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

As well, few studies have assessed within-season variation. Since physiological adjustments often are influenced by environmental factors, and the types of environments vary with geography, we expected variance in hibernation patterns among geographically separated populations. Our specific goal was to measure intraspecific variation in torpid metabolic rate (TMR) and body temperature (Tb) as a function of ambient temperature (Ta) for a non-migratory and migratory species to determine whether there is a continuum in physiological responses based on latitude. We chose big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) as model species and sampled individuals from populations throughout each species’ winter range. In both species, individuals from southern populations maintained higher TMR at cooler Tas and lower TMR at warmer Tas than those from northern populations. Big brown bats from southern populations regulated Tb during torpor at higher levels and there was no significant difference in Tb between populations of eastern red bats. Although metabolic responses were similar across the gradient between species, the effect was more dramatic in big brown bats. Our data demonstrate a continuum in thermoregulatory response, ranging from classic hibernation in northern populations to a pattern more akin to daily torpor in southern populations.

Male and female last instar larvae display age-dependent cyclic patterns of activity with maxima during early to mid scotophase and minima during early photophase. A period of low locomotor activity without time of day-dependent cyclic changes starts 1 day before the final moult and lasts until 1 day after the moult. Then, both excitability and locomotor activity increase and become cyclic again within 2 or 3 days. The cyclic changes gradually dampen in adult females older than 6 days and finally cease. When injected into photophase larvae and adults, adipokinetic hormone (AKH) increases excitability and locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it has no such effect when injected into scotophase animals. Other behaviours (jumping, hind wing trembling) that mostly occur in scotophase crickets are also increased by injecting AKH into photophase crickets. We argue that AKH could be responsible for linking the endogenous clock output with the cyclic changes in locomotor activity. Furthermore, AKH may serve to synchronise metabolism and behaviour to optimise larval development and reproduction.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Avoidance steering is triggered by high-firing-rate bursts of spikes in the auditory command neuron AN2. Although bursting is common among sensory neurons, and although the detailed structure of bursts may encode information about the stimulus, it is as yet unclear whether this information is decoded. We address this question in two ways: from an information coding point of view, by showing the relationship between stimulus and burst structure; and also from a functional point of view by showing the relationship between burst structure and behavior.

To identify objects reliably, intensity invariant representations have to be formed. We approached this problem within the auditory pathway of grasshoppers. We presented AM patterns modulated at different time scales and intensities. Metric space analysis of neuronal responses allowed us to determine how well, how invariantly, and at which time scales AM frequency is encoded. We find that in some neurons spike-count cues contribute substantially (20–60%) to the decoding of AM frequency at a single intensity. However, such cues are not robust when intensity varies. The general intensity invariance of the system is poor. However, there exists a range of AM frequencies around 83 Hz where intensity invariance of local interneurons is relatively high. In this range, natural communication signals exhibit much variation between species, suggesting an important behavioral role for this frequency band. We hypothesize, just as has been proposed for human speech, that the communication signals might have evolved to match the processing properties of the receivers. This contrasts with optimal coding theory, which postulates that neuronal systems are adapted to the statistics of the relevant signals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Typical pacemaker activity with slow diastolic depolarization was observed in all recordings. The average maximum diastolic potential (−58.4 ± 3.2 mV), the average amplitude of the action potential (28.7 ± 4.7 mV) and the average total duration of the action potential (2,434 ± 430 ms) were determined. There has been no gradient of automaticity observed in our studies, which suggests that all regions of the Arenicola heart could possess pacemaker functions. Acetylcholine (ACh) produced a concentration dependent (5 × 10−8–5 × 10−5 M) increase of the beating rate via increase in the rate of the diastolic depolarization. ACh (5 × 10−5 M) increased beating rate by 2.5-fold compared to the control rate. A stronger action of ACh resulted in depolarization, block of action potential generation and contracture of the heart. The non-hydrolysable ACh analog carbacholine (10−8–10−6 M) produced similar effects. All effects of ACh and carbacholine were abolished by 5 × 10−6 M atropine. d-Tubocurarine (5 × 10−5 M) did not significantly alter effects of ACh or carbacholine.

Anatomical and biochemical information indicates the existence of distinct neural populations within the frog nucleus isthmi, which raises the question: are there electrophysiological distinctions between neurons that are putatively classified by their anatomical and biochemical properties? To address this question, we measured frog nucleus isthmi neuron cellular properties in vitro and visual response properties in vivo.

In mammals, a master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, adjusts timing of other self-sustained oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs. Synchronisation to external cues is mainly achieved by ambient light, which resets the SCN clock. Other environmental factors, in particular food availability and time of feeding, also influence internal timing. Timed feeding can reset the phase of the peripheral oscillators whilst having almost no effect in shifting the phase of the SCN clockwork when animals are exposed (synchronised) to a light–dark cycle. Food deprivation and calorie restriction lead not only to loss of body mass (>15%) and increased motor activity, but also affect the timing of daily activity, nocturnal animals becoming partially diurnal (i.e. they are active during their usual sleep period). This change in behavioural timing is due in part to the fact that metabolic cues associated with calorie restriction affect the SCN clock and its synchronisation to light.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, we provide a first quantitative description of torpor in the relict marsupial Dromiciops gliroides by: (1) characterizing body temperature (TB) and torpor patterns, (2) evaluating the combined effects of ambient temperature and different levels of food restriction on torpor incidence and (3) exploring the metabolic depression during torpor. D. gliroides exhibited short bouts of torpor on a daily basis, during which TB decreased close to ambient temperature. During the active phase, TB also exhibited pronounced variation (range 34–38°C). In order to evaluate the consistency of torpor, we computed the repeatability of TB. Using the whole dataset, repeatability was significant (τ = 0.28). However, when torpid individuals were excluded from the analysis, repeatability was non-significant: some individuals were more prone to experience torpor than others. Our results indicate that this species also exhibits short bouts of daily torpor, whose depth and duration depends on the joint effects of TA and food availability. At TA = 20°C, the maximum torpor incidence was found at 70–80% food reduction, while at both extremes of the food continuum (100 and 0–10% food reduction) individuals were completely active, although considerable variation in TB was recorded. At TA = 10°C, individuals developed a deep form of torpor that was independent of the amount of food provided. On average, torpid D. gliroides reduced their metabolic rate up to 92% of their active values.

L. stagnalis sticks to the substratum by the foot sole and moves smoothly with no visible contractions of the foot. A ciliated epithelium covering the sole is underlain by smooth muscle cells containing giant mitochondria. It is shown here that slow (basal) locomotor activity (measured as the flow rate of physiological saline over isolated sole) appears spontaneously or is induced by 10−8–10−7 M 5-HT. 5-HT (10−7–10−4 M) facilitates locomotor activity dose-dependently, and KCN (an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration) decreases these effects to the basal level. 5-HT and KCN have no effect on the frequency of ciliary beat (stroboscopic measurements), and blockers of anaerobic glycolysis inhibit ciliary motility. Under anaerobic conditions locomotion of a snail is slow and insensitive to 5-HT in contrast to that in aerobic environments. It is concluded that glycolysis supplies energy to ciliated cells and respiration to sole muscle cells; 5-HT stimulates ciliary beating in an all-or-none fashion and muscular waves in a dose-dependent manner; cilia provide slow (basal) gliding, and locomotory rate up to 80% above the basal level is determined by muscular waves.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The factors affecting the poor penetration of elasmobranchs into FW environments are currently unknown, however, an important consideration may be the high urea requirement of many proteins in marine elasmobranchs. Urea is an important osmolyte in marine elasmobranchs and must be reduced in dilute environments. There are three identifiable stages in the successful colonization of FW. The euryhaline marine species freely entering and leaving FW represent the initial stage of FW colonization. In this group, there is an apparent inability to eliminate all urea due to protein integrity issues and this results in energy and nitrogen losses that may constrain growth and reproduction. The second stage is represented by those species that live entirely in FW but must also retain some urea. This group also suffers from the same constraints as the first group. These two groups have kidneys and sensory organs that more closely resemble strictly marine forms. The third and final stage is represented by the Potamotrygonid stingrays where the need for urea in FW has been eliminated. Consequently nitrogen and energy losses are reduced and those sections of the kidney needed for urea conservation have been eliminated. The driving force for such modifications is a reduction in urea levels and the concomitant saving of energy needed for urea synthesis. Other physiological adaptations associated with survival in FW include giving birth to live young, the capacity of sperm to be activated in freshwater and modifications of the electrosensory system to function in a low conductivity environment. The need for many anatomical, metabolic and physiological modifications for FW existence may constrain the rapidity and hence the frequency of FW colonization, compared to the situation in the more advanced osmoregulating teleosts. Once optimally adapted to FW, recolonization of sea water by elasmobranchs is problematic due to the loss of urea synthetic capacity and renal structures for urea retention.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although the importance of these adaptations for supporting aerobic diving patterns of adults is well understood, little is known about postnatal muscle development in young marine mammals. However, the typical pattern of vertebrate muscle development, and reduced tissue O2 stores and diving ability of young marine mammals suggest that the physiological properties of harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) pup muscle will differ from those of adults. We examined myoglobin (Mb) concentration, and the activities of citrate synthase (CS), β-hydroxyacyl coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in muscle biopsies from harbor seal pups throughout the nursing period, and compared these biochemical parameters to those of adults. Pups had reduced O2 carrying capacity ([Mb] 28–41% lower than adults) and reduced metabolically scaled catabolic enzyme activities (LDH/RMR 20–58% and CS/RMR 29–89% lower than adults), indicating that harbor seal pup muscles are biochemically immature at birth and weaning. This suggests that pup muscles do not have the ability to support either the aerobic or anaerobic performance of adult seals. This immaturity may contribute to the lower diving capacity and behavior in younger pups. In addition, the trends in myoglobin concentration and enzyme activity seen in this study appear to be developmental and/or exercise-driven responses that together work to produce the hypoxic endurance phenotype seen in adults, rather than allometric effects due to body size.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

When the stimulus contained only high frequencies (>5 kHz) no changes in striking behavior were observed. But when only frequencies from 1 to 5 kHz were presented, localization accuracy and precision decreased. In a second step we tested whether a further border exists at 2.5 kHz as suggested by optimality models. When we compared striking behavior for a stimulus having energy from 2.5 to 5 kHz with a stimulus having energy between 1 and 2.5 kHz, no consistent differences in striking behavior were observed. It was further found that pre-takeoff latency was longer for the latter stimulus than for baseline and that center frequency was a better predictor for landing precision than stimulus bandwidth.

In both training groups [water current velocities 1 and 2 body lengths per second (bl s−1)] the plasma level of FFAs decreased significantly (P < 0.001) compared to the control group. Similar significant (P < 0.01) post-exercise decrease was observed also in the lipase-esterase activity in the red muscle, but not in white. Moreover, in the group swimming with higher intensity a significantly higher (P < 0.05) lipase-esterase activity in the red muscle was found compared with the group on moderate exercise. As with cytochrome c oxidase activity, a significant elevation in the enzyme activity was also observed after training in the 1 bl s−1 group in red and white muscle (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively).

To quantify behavioral responses, we stimulated both intact leeches and isolated body wall preparations from the two species. In response to mechanical stimulation, Hirudo showed local bending behavior, in which the body wall shortened only on the side of the stimulation. Erpobdella, in contrast, contracted both sides of the body in response to touch. To investigate the neuronal basis for this behavioral difference, we studied the interactions between P cells. Each midbody ganglion has four P cells; each cell innervates a different quadrant of the body wall. Consistent with local bending, activating any one P cell in Hirudo elicited polysynaptic inhibitory potentials in the other P cells. In contrast, the P cells in Erpobdella had excitatory polysynaptic connections, consistent with the segment-wide contraction observed in this species. In addition, activating individual P cells caused asymmetrical body wall contractions in Hirudo and symmetrical body wall contractions in Erpobdella. These results suggest that the different behavioral responses in Erpobdella and Hirudo are partly mediated by interactions among mechanosensory cells.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A prominent example is the wing beat frequency of desert locusts, which can be entrained to rhythmic mechanosensory input, but also to the frequency of periodic light flashes. To further analyze the entrainment by light, tethered flying locusts were presented with periodic light flashes, while the position of the forewing was filmed. We show that entrainment of wing beat occurs both in the UV and green range of light. Animals maintained a characteristic phase relationship to the light stimulus with the most elevated wing position occurring at the end of the dark phase. Speed and time course of entrainment varied greatly and ranged from the duration of a single wing beat cycle to several seconds. To identify the visual system mediating entrainment, synchronization to UV light was tested after cutting the optic stalks to the optic lobes/compound eyes or the ocellar nerves. The results show that light entrainment of the locust flight pattern is largely and perhaps exclusively mediated via the fast ocellar pathway and may have a role to stabilize flight with respect to the horizon.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, acid–base status may be oppositely affected by the two processes. In this study, we first investigated the acid–base response of Chinese catfish to feeding (the meal size was about 8% of body mass) to test whether an alkaline tide (a metabolic alkalosis created by gastric HCl secretion after feeding) would occur. We then determined the combined effects of feeding and exhaustive exercise on excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and acid–base status to determine whether the alkaline tide induced by feeding protects against acid–base disturbance during exhaustive exercise and affects subsequent recovery. Arterial blood pH increased from 7.74 ± 0.02 before feeding to 7.88 ± 0.02 and plasma [HCO3−]pl increased from 5.42 ± 0.29 to 7.83 ± 0.37 mmol L−1 6 h after feeding, while feeding had no significant effect on $$ P_{{{\text{CO}}_{2} }} $$.

Most terrestrial ectotherms use thermoregulatory strategies to maintain body temperature within an optimal range, while many aquatic ectotherms utilise thermal acclimation to maintain performance over varying seasonal temperatures. This study aimed to elucidate the relative contributions of acclimation and behavioural thermoregulation to maintaining whole-animal performance over varying seasonal temperatures in the semi-terrestrial Lamington spiny crayfish (Euastacus sulcatus). Crayfish activity and surface temperatures were determined by means of radio tracking and behavioural observations. Field studies demonstrated that E. sulcatus is exposed to stable daily temperatures, varying only between seasons from 10°C in late winter to over 20°C in summer. Also, terrestrial behaviour corresponded to a small portion of crayfish time (1.13%), much lower than predicted, indicating that E. sulcatus has limited opportunity for behavioural thermoregulation. We also tested the effect of acclimation to either 10 or 20°C on chela strength and stamina. We found acclimation had a more marked effect on chela stamina than maximum strength measures; however, overall acclimatory capacity was limited in E. sulcatus.

During arousal from the torpor phase of hibernation this suppression is reversed and metabolic rates rise dramatically. In this study, we used the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) to assess isolated liver mitochondrial respiration during the torpor phase of hibernation and various stages of arousal to elucidate a potential role of SDH in metabolic suppression. State 3 and state 4 respiration rates were seven- and threefold lower in torpor compared with the summer-active and interbout euthermic states. Respiration rates increased during arousal so that when body temperature reached 30°C in late arousal, state 3 and state 4 respiration were 3.3- and 1.8-fold greater than during torpor, respectively. SDH activity was 72% higher in interbout euthermia than in torpor. Pre-incubating with isocitrate [to alleviate oxaloacetate (OAA) inhibition] increased state 3 respiration rate during torpor by 91%, but this rate was still fourfold lower than that measured in interbout euthermia. Isocitrate pre-incubation also eliminated differences in SDH activity among hibernation bout stages. OAA concentration correlated negatively with both respiration rates and SDH activity. These data suggest that OAA reversibly inhibits SDH in torpor, but cannot fully account for the drastic metabolic suppression observed during this hibernation phase.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, understanding has been scarce as to how the dolphin cochlea is stimulated by high frequency echoes, and likewise regarding the ear mechanics affecting dolphin audiograms. The characteristic impedance of mammalian soft tissues is similar to that of water, and thus no radical refractions of sound, nor reflections of sound, can be expected at the water/soft tissue interfaces. Consequently, a sound-collecting terrestrial pinna and an outer ear canal serve little purpose in underwater hearing. Additionally, compared to terrestrial mammals whose middle ear performs an impedance match from air to the cochlea, the impedance match performed by the odontocete middle ear needs to be reversed to perform an opposite match from water to the cochlea. In this paper, we discuss anatomical adaptations of dolphins: a lower jaw collecting sound, thus replacing the terrestrial outer ear pinna, and a thin and large tympanic bone plate replacing the tympanic membrane of terrestrial mammals. The paper describes the lower jaw anatomy and hypothetical middle ear mechanisms explaining both the high sensitivity and the converted acoustic impedance match.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Moreover, this difference in body temperature was maintained under thermophilic physiological states such as digestion and molting. Physiological and locomotory performances were optimized at higher temperatures in H. viridiflavus compared to Z. longissimus, as predicted by the thermal coadaptation hypothesis.

Here, implanted data loggers were used to simultaneously measure heart rate (fH), visceral temperature, and a derivation of acceleration in two groups of wild adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) held at two different water speeds (slow and fast). Calibration experiments performed with individual fish in a swim tunnel respirometer generated strong relationships between acceleration, fH, tail beat frequency and energy expenditure over a wide range of swimming velocities. The regression equations were then used to estimate the overall energy expenditure of the groups of fish held at different water speeds. As expected, fish held at faster water speeds exhibited greater fH and acceleration, and correspondingly a higher estimated energy expenditure than fish held at slower water speeds. These estimates were consistent with gross somatic energy density of fish at death, as determined using proximate analyses of a dorsal tissue sample. Heart rate alone and in combination with acceleration, rather than acceleration alone, provided the most accurate proxies for energy expenditure in these studies. Even so, acceleration provided useful information on the behaviour of fish and may itself prove to be a valuable proxy for energy expenditure under different environmental conditions, using a different derivation of the acceleration data, and/or with further calibration experiments. These results strengthen the possibility that biologging or biotelemetry of fH and acceleration may be usefully applied to migrating sockeye salmon to monitor physiology and behaviour, and to estimate energy use in the natural environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The Indian short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx, emits distress calls soon after becoming entangled in mist nets, which appear to attract conspecifics. Phase I of these distress calls is longer and louder, and includes a secondary peak, compared to phase II. Activity-dependent expression of egr-1 was examined in free-ranging C. sphinx following the emissions and responses to a distress call. We found that the level of expression of egr-1 was higher in bats that emitted a distress call, in adults that responded, and in pups than in silent bats. Up-regulated cDNA was amplified to identify the target gene (TOE1) of the protein Egr-1. The observed expression pattern Toe1 was similar to that of egr-1. These findings suggest that the neuronal activity related to recognition of a distress call and an auditory feedback mechanism induces the expression of Egr-1. Co-expression of egr-1 with Toe1 may play a role in initial triggering of the genetic mechanism that could be involved in the consolidation or stabilization of distress call memories.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Strong phylogenetic signal was detected in the data for the caecum, colon and large intestine, but not for the small intestine. Most of the phylogenetic signal could be attributed to clade effects associated with herbivorous versus omnivorous rodents. The herbivorous rodents have longer caecums, colons and large intestines, but their small intestines, with the exception of the desert otomyine rodents, are no different to those of omnivorous rodents. Desert otomyine rodents have significantly shorter small intestines than all other rodents, reflecting a possible habitat effect and providing a partial explanation for the low basal metabolic rates of small desert mammals. However, the desert otomyines do not have shorter colons or large intestines, challenging claims for adaptation to water retention in arid environments. Data for the Arvicolidae revealed significantly larger caecums and colons, and hence longer large intestines, with no compensatory reduction in the length of the small intestine, which may explain how the smallest mammalian herbivores manage to meet the demands of a very high mass-specific metabolic rate. This study provides phylogenetically corrected allometries suitable for future prediction testing.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A contig of 1,990 bp in length was recognized as a UCP1 ortholog after initial searches in the gilthead sea bream AQUAFIRST database (http://www.sigenae.org/aquafirst). Additional searches were performed in skeletal muscle by RT-PCR, and the amplified PCR product was recognized as UCP3 after sequence completion by 5′- and 3′RACE. UCP1 expression was mostly detected in liver, whereas UCP3 transcripts were only found in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres (white skeletal muscle > red skeletal muscle > heart). Specific gene regulation of UCP1 (liver) and UCP3 (white skeletal muscle) was addressed in physiological models of age, seasonal growth and energy-metabolic unbalances. Both the increase in energy demand (stress confinement) and the reduction in energy supply during adaptive cold response in winter down-regulated UCP1 expression. Conversely, transcript levels of UCP3 were higher with age, seasonal fattening and dietary deficiencies in essential fatty acids leading to the increase in fatty acid flux towards the muscle. This close association between UCP1 and UCP3 with the oxidative and metabolic tissue status is perhaps directly related to the ancestral protein UCP function, and allows the use of UCPs as lipotoxicity markers in ectothermic fish.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The aim of this study was to correlate the presence of tight junction proteins and paracellular barrier properties along rat intestine. Tissue segments of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon were stripped of submucosal cell layers and mounted in Ussing chambers for impedance spectroscopy to measure epithelial resistance (Repi). In parallel, expression of tight junction proteins was analysed by Western blots and immune fluorescence confocal microscopy. Colon showed highest Repi, followed by duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In small intestine, common transepithelial resistance (Rtrans or TER) overestimated true Repi by ~60%. In colon, strongest expression of “tightening” claudins 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 was detected. In accordance with Repi the most proximal of the small intestinal segments, duodenum exhibited highest expression of “tightening” claudins and lowest expression of claudins mediating permeability, namely claudin-2, -7, and -12, compared to jejunum and ileum.

One such adaptation is the reported colour difference caused by unequal distribution of anthocyanidin pigments amongst plant species visited by hummingbirds and passerines. This phenomenon has been suggested to reflect possible differences in the colour vision of these pollinating birds. The presence of any such difference in colour vision would arguably affect the ecological and evolutionary interactions between flowers and their visitors, accentuating differences in floral displays and attractiveness of plants to the favoured avian pollinators. We have tested for differences in colour vision, as indicated by the amino acid present at certain key positions in the short-wavelength-sensitive type 1 (SWS1) visual pigment opsin, between the major groups of pollinating birds: the non-passerine Trochilidae (hummingbirds), the passerine Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Nectariniidae (sunbirds) plus five other Passerida passerine families.

Simultaneously, blood chemistry changes induced by stress responses may confound experimental design by interacting with the biological parameters being measured. Cortisol elevation is a common indicator of stress responses in mammals and reproductive condition can profoundly influence endocrine response. We measured changes in blood cortisol and testosterone induced by handling reproductively active male Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) early and late in the breeding season. Weddell seals have the highest resting cortisol levels of all mammals yet showed a clear, prolonged elevation in cortisol in response to capture. Responses were similar when first caught and when caught a second time, later in the breeding season. Baseline testosterone levels declined over the breeding season but were not altered by capture. Administering a light dose of diazepam significantly ameliorated the cortisol response of handled animals without affecting testosterone levels.

Primitive species, such as elasmobranchs and sarcopterygians have been shown to rely on the former, while derived species, such as teleosts rely on the latter. Both strategies are effective in the transport of CO2 in the blood. However, there is a paucity of information on the nature of the transition between these two strategies that appears to occur within the intermediate group of fishes, the basal actinopterygians. The objective of the present study was to simultaneously assess the intrinsic Hb buffer values and Haldane effects of species within the basal actinopterygian lineage to characterize the transition in Hb-proton-binding strategy seen among the fishes. Expressed in order of most basal to most derived, the species investigated included American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula), bowfin (Amia calva), and mooneye (Hiodon tergisus). Hemolysates from these species were prepared and Hb titrations (under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions) were performed in both the presence and absence of saturating levels of organic phosphates (GTP). The findings suggest that the nature of the Hb-proton-binding transition may have been punctuated rather than gradual, with the Hb buffer value decreasing and the Haldane effect increasing significantly in bowfin from fairly steady ancestral levels in the four more basal species. This change is coupled with the initial appearance of the choroid rete, as well as an increase in the magnitude and onset pH of the Root effect in bowfin, suggesting that the change in Hb-proton-binding strategy may be associated with the evolution of enhanced O2 delivery to the eye and an in vivo operational Root effect.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Osmoregulation has been studied in marine mammals for a century. Research assessing the effects of ingested fresh water or seawater in dolphins, however, has been limited to few animals and sampling times. Nine 16- to 25-h studies were conducted on eight adult dolphins to assess the hourly impact of fresh water, seawater, and seawater with protein ingestion on plasma and urine osmolality, urine flow rate (ufr), urinary and plasma solute concentrations, and solute clearance rates. Fresh water ingestion increased ufr. Fresh water ingestion also decreased plasma and urine osmolality, sodium and chloride urine concentrations, and solute excretion rates. Seawater ingestion resulted in increased ufr, sodium, chloride, and potassium urine concentrations, sodium excretion rates, and urine osmolality. Seawater with protein ingestion was associated with increased ufr, plasma osmolality, sodium excretion, and sodium, chloride, potassium, and urea urine concentrations. In conclusion, bottlenose dolphins appear to maintain water and plasma solute balance after ingesting fresh water or seawater by altering urine osmolality and solute clearance.

By retrograde tracing from the muscles, the motoneurons of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) were located caudally within the mid-region of the glossopharyngeal-vagal motor complex (mGVC). In contrast, the motoneurons innervating the pharyngeal wall were localized medially within mGVC. Sensory pharyngeal fibers in the vagal nerve terminated in the caudal region of the viscerosensory column (cVSC). Using the isolated brain, we recorded 51 spontaneously active neurons within mGVC. These neurons could be divided into rhythmically (n = 8) and continuously (n = 43) firing units. The rhythmically firing neurons seemed to be restricted medially, whereas the continuously firing neurons were found caudally within mGVC. The rhythmically firing neurons were activated by the stimulation of the cVSC. In contrast, the stimulation of the cVSC inhibited firing of most, but not all the continuously firing neurons. The inhibitory effect was blocked by prazosin in 17 out of 38 neurons. Yohimbine also blocked the cVSC-induced inhibition in five of prazosin-sensitive neurons. We suggest that the neurons in cVSC inhibit the continuously firing motoneurons to relax the UES and stimulate the rhythmically firing neurons to constrict the pharynx simultaneously.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study examines whether 17-beta-estradiol interacts with an opioidergic network to achieve rapid modulation of a vocal control circuit. Adult plainfin midshipman fish emit vocalizations that mainly differ in duration, and rhythmic activity of a hindbrain–spinal vocal pattern generator (VPG) directly establishes the temporal features of midshipman vocalizations. VPG activity is therefore predictive of natural calls, and ‘fictive calls’ can be elicited by electrical microstimulation of the VPG. Prior studies show that intramuscular estradiol injection rapidly (within 5 min) increases fictive call duration in midshipman. Here, we delivered opioid antagonists near the VPG prior to estradiol injection. Rapid estradiol actions on fictive calling were completely suppressed by the broad-spectrum opioid antagonist naloxone and the mu-opioid antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, but were unaffected by the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Unexpectedly, prior to estradiol administration, all three opioid antagonists caused immediate, transient reductions in fictive call duration. Together, our results indicate that: (1) vocal activity is modulated by opioidergic networks, confirming hypotheses from birds and mammals, and (2) the rapid actions of estradiol on vocal patterning depend on interactions with a mu-opioid modulatory network.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

They determine the responses of sensory neurons which mediate critical behaviours and ecological adaptations. We investigated the evolution across the genus Drosophila of a subfamily of Or genes largely responsible for the perception of ecologically relevant aliphatic esters; products of yeast fermentation and fruits. Odour responses were recorded from eight classes of olfactory receptor neurons known to express this Or subfamily in D. melanogaster and from homologous sensilla in seven other species. Despite the fact that these species have diverged over an estimated 40 million years, we find that odour specificity is largely maintained in seven of the eight species. In contrast, we observe extensive changes in most neurons of the outgroup species D. virilis, and in two neurons across the entire genus. Some neurons show small shifts in specificity, whilst some dramatic changes correlate with gene duplication or loss. An olfactory receptor neuron response similarity tree did not match an Or sequence similarity tree, but by aligning Or proteins of likely functional equivalence we identify residues that may be relevant for odour specificity.

Thus, motoneuron function is an essential element for understanding control of animal locomotion. This paper presents motoneuron input–output relationships, including impulse adaptation, in the medicinal leech. We found that although frequency-current graphs generated by passing 1-s current pulses in neuron somata were non-linear, peak and steady-state graphs of frequency against membrane potential were linear, with slopes of 5.2 and 2.9 Hz/mV, respectively. Systems analysis of impulse frequency adaptation revealed a static threshold nonlinearity at −43 mV (impulse threshold) and a single time constant (τ = 88 ms). This simple model accurately predicts motoneuron impulse frequency when tested by intracellular injection of sinusoidal current. We investigated electrical coupling within motoneurons by modeling these as three-compartment structures. This model, combined with the membrane potential–impulse frequency relationship, accurately predicted motoneuron impulse frequency from intracellular records of soma potentials obtained during fictive swimming. A corollary result was that the product of soma-to-neurite and neurite-to-soma coupling coefficients in leech motoneurons is large, 0.85, implying that the soma and neurite are electrically compact.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure mRNA levels of opioid peptide precursors and receptors in the brain and heart of summer ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and winter hibernating squirrels in the torpid or interbout arousal states. The use of appropriate reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR gene expression data can have profound effects on the analysis and interpretation of results. This may be particularly important when experimental subjects, such as hibernating animals, undergo significant morphological and/or functional changes during the study. Therefore, an additional goal of this study was to identify stable reference genes for use in qRT-PCR studies of the 13-lined ground squirrel. Expression levels of 10 potential reference genes were measured in the small intestine, liver, brain, and heart, and the optimal combinations of the most stable reference genes were identified by the GeNorm Excel applet. Based on this analysis, we provide recommendations for reference genes to use in each tissue that would be suitable for comparative studies among different activity states. When appropriate normalization of mRNA levels was used, there were no changes in opioid-related genes in heart among the three activity states; in brain, DOR expression was highest during torpor, lowest in interbout arousal and intermediate in summer. The results support the idea that changes in DOR expression may regulate the level of neuronal activity in brain during the annual hibernation cycle and may contribute to hibernation-associated tissue protection.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It has been reported elsewhere that SW-exposed juvenile O. marmorata exhibits hypoosmotic and hypoionic regulation, with the induction of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC), and cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor-like chloride channels. Here, we report that SW exposure also led to significant increases in the activity and protein abundance of NKA in, and probably an increase in Na+ uptake through, its intestine. Additionally, there was an increase in apical NKCC immunoreactivity in the intestinal epithelium, indicating that there could be increased Cl− uptake through the intestine. These results suggest that absorption of ions, and hence water, from the intestinal lumen could be an essential part of the osmoregulatory process in juvenile O. marmorata during exposure to SW. Furthermore, there were significant increases in the glutamate content, and the aminating activity and protein abundance of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in the intestine of fish exposed to SW. Since the intestinal glutamine synthetase activity and protein abundance decreased significantly, and the intestinal glutamine content remained unchanged, in the SW-exposed fish, excess glutamate formed via increased GDH activity in the intestine could be channeled to other organs to facilitate the increased synthesis of amino acids. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that, besides absorbing ions and water during SW exposure, the intestine of juvenile O. marmorata also participated in altered nitrogen metabolism in response to salinity changes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This bradycardia deepened over the subsequent 20 min of progressive hypoxia and noticeable arrhythmias occurred, suggesting that hypoxia had direct and severe effects on the cardiac myocytes.

During re-oxygenation, heart rate and white muscle perfusion increased as the DO concentration exceeded 1.9 ± 0.1 mg L−1, whereas haemoglobin saturation increased once the external DO concentration reached 2.9 mg L−1. These changes occurred in anaesthetised fish, in which sensory function must be impaired, if not abolished. As white muscle perfusion both fell and increased prior to changes in white muscle oxyhaemoglobin saturation, a local hypoxia is more likely to be the consequence than the cause of the reduced blood delivery, and changes upstream from the tail vasculature must be responsible.

Our key questions were: is resting metabolic rate (RMR) increased during the winter season when dogs are working? Does feeding regime affect RMR during summer? What is the proportion of metabolic rate (MR) devoted to specific dynamic action (SDA), and what is the metabolic scope of working Inuit sled dogs? The Inuit dogs had an extremely wide thermoneutral zone extending down to −25°C. Temperature changes between summer and winter did not affect RMR, thus summer fasting periods were defined as baseline RMR. Relative to this baseline, summer MR was upregulated in the group of dogs receiving low energy food, whereas heart rate was downregulated. However, during food digestion, both MR and HR were twice their respective baseline values. A continuously elevated MR was observed during winter. Because temperature effects were excluded and because there were also no effects of training, we attribute winter elevated MR to SDA because of the continuous food supply.

Dilocarcinus pagei, a freshwater crab endemic to Brazil, was studied to understand Ca2+ transport in whole gill cells using a fluorescent probe. Cells were dissociated, all of the gill cell types were loaded with fluo-3 and intracellular Ca2+ change was monitored by adding Ca as CaCl2 (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 5 mM), with a series of different inhibitors. For control gill cells, Ca2+ transport followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics with Km = 0.42 ± 0.04 mM and Vmax = 0.50 ± 0.02 μM (Ca2+ change × initial intracellular Ca−1 × 180 s−1; N = 14, r2 = 0.99). Verapamil (a Ca2+ channel inhibitor) and amiloride (a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger [NCX] inhibitor) completely reduced intracellular Ca2+ transport, while nifedipine, another Ca2+ channel inhibitor, did not. Vanadate, a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor (PMCA), increased intracellular Ca2+ in gill cells through a decrease in the efflux of Ca2+. Ouabain increased intracellular Ca2+, similar to the effect of KB-R, a specific NCX inhibitor for Ca2+ in the influx mode. Alterations in extracellular [Na] in the saline did not affect intracellular Ca2+ transport. Caffeine, responsible for inducing Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in vertebrate muscle, increased intracellular Ca2+ compared to control, suggesting an effect of this inhibitor in gill epithelial cells of Dilocarcinus pagei, probably through release of intracellular stores. We also demonstrate here that intracellular Ca2+ in gill cells of Dilocarcinus pagei was kept relatively constant in face of an extracellular Ca concentration of 50-fold, suggesting that crustaceans are able to display Ca2+ homeostasis through various Ca2+ intracellular sequestration mechanisms and/or plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and outflux that are highly regulatory. In summary, studies using whole gill cells are an interesting approach for working with real regulatory Ca2+ mechanisms in intact cells under physiological Ca levels (mM range), compared to earlier work using isolated vesicles of various epithelial cells.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hybrid fibres containing 2A and slow MyHCs were virtually absent. These results are more detailed but broadly similar to the earlier studies on eutherians. We hypothesize that hypothyroidism essentially reverses the effects of thyroid hormone on MyHC gene expression of muscle fibres during myogenesis, which differ according to the developmental origin of the fibre: it induces slow MyHC expression in 2b fibres derived from fast primary myotubes, and shifts fast MyHC expression in fibres of secondary origin towards 2A, but not slow, MyHC.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This hypoxic bradycardia has been characterised for many fish species, but it remains uncertain whether this reflex contributes to the maintenance of oxygen uptake in hypoxia. Here we describe the effects of inhibiting the bradycardia on oxygen consumption (MO2), standard metabolic rate (SMR) and the critical oxygen partial pressure for regulation of SMR in hypoxia (Pcrit) in European eels Anguilla anguilla (mean ± SEM mass 528 ± 36 g; n = 14). Eels were instrumented with a Transonic flow probe around the ventral aorta to measure cardiac output (Q) and heart rate (fH). MO2 was then measured by intermittent closed respirometry during sequential exposure to various levels of increasing hypoxia, to determine Pcrit. Each fish was studied before and after abolition of reflex bradycardia by intraperitoneal injection of the muscarinic antagonist atropine (5 mg kg−1). In the untreated eels, fH fell from 39.0 ± 4.3 min−1 in normoxia to 14.8 ± 5.2 min−1 at the deepest level of hypoxia (2 kPa), and this was associated with a decline in Q, from 7.5 ± 0.8 mL min−1 kg−1 to 3.3 ± 0.7 mL min−1 kg−1 in normoxia versus deepest hypoxia, respectively. Atropine had no effect on SMR, which was 16.0 ± 1.8 μmol O2 kg−1 min−1 in control versus 16.8 ± 0.8 μmol O2 kg−1 min−1 following treatment with atropine. Atropine also had no significant effect on normoxic fH or Q in the eel, but completely abolished the bradycardia and associated decline in Q during progressive hypoxia. This pharmacological inhibition of the cardiac responses to hypoxia was, however, without affect on Pcrit, which was 11.7 ± 1.3 versus 12.5 ± 1.5 kPa in control versus atropinised eels, respectively.

Previous studies have revealed that individuals from both habitats are not distinguishable by morphological characters or by sequence comparison of DNA encoding 16S RNA or cytochrome C. As reported in this study, animals collected in the two habitats differ substantially in their physiological ability to adapt to different salinities. Comparison of accumulation rates of ninhydrin-positive substances (NPS) in foot muscle upon transfer of animals to higher medium salinities revealed that brackish water animals were perfectly able to mobilize NPS, while freshwater animals had only limited ability to do so. In an attempt to explore whether this difference in physiology may be caused by genetic differentiation, we compared protein expression patterns of soluble foot muscle proteins using 2D gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Of the 40 consistently detected protein spots, 27 showed similar levels in protein expression in animals collected from freshwater or brackish water habitats, respectively. In 12 spots, however, protein concentration was higher in brackish water than in freshwater animals. In four of these spots, expression levels followed increases or decreases in medium salinities. In a different set of 4 of these 12 spots, protein levels were always higher in brackish water as compared to freshwater animals, regardless of their physiological situation (14 days in artificial pond water or in medium with a salinity of 16‰). The remaining 4 of the 12 spots had complex expression patterns. Protein levels of the remaining single spot were generally higher in freshwater animals than in brackish water animals.

In addition, the hibernator’s neuronal tissues enter into a protected state in which the potential for ischemia–reperfusion injury is markedly minimized. Evolutionary adaptations for continued function and neuroprotection throughout cycles of torpor and euthermia in winter are predicted to manifest themselves partly in changes in the brainstem proteome. Here, we compare the soluble brainstem protein complement from six summer active ground squirrels and six in the early torpor (ET) phase of hibernation. Thirteen percent of the ~1,500 quantifiable 2D gel spots alter significantly from summer to ET; the proteins identified in these differing spots are known to play roles in energy homeostasis via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (8 proteins), cytoarchitecture and cell motility (14 proteins), anabolic protein processes (13 proteins), redox control (11 proteins) and numerous other categories including protein catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, signal transduction, glycolysis, intracellular protein trafficking and antiapoptotic function. These protein changes represent, at least in part, the molecular bases for restructuring of cells in the brainstem, a shift away from glucose as the primary fuel source for brain in the winter, and the generation of a streamlined mechanism capable of efficient and rapid energy production and utilization during the torpor and arousal cycles of hibernation.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although such a bilateral feature of peropsin seems to be important for understanding the diversity of the opsin family, previous studies have been limited to higher deuterostome, vertebrate and amphioxus peropsins. Here, we report a protostome peropsin homologue from a jumping spider. We found a spider opsin that shares amino acid homology and conserved amino acid residues with known peropsins. The spider opsin-based pigment heterologously expressed in cultured cells exhibited photoisomerase-like isomerization characteristics and a bistable nature. Based on the characteristics of both the amino acid homology and its photochemical properties, we concluded that the spider opsin is the first protostome peropsin homologue. These results show that peropsin existed before the deuterostome–protostome split like other members of the opsin family. In addition, the spider peropsin was localized to non-visual cells in the retina, and fluorescence from reduced retinal chromophore was also observed in the region where peropsin was localized. These findings provide the first demonstration that the peropsin can form a photosensitive pigment in vivo and underlie non-visual function.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The functional significance of periodic arousals is still uncertain. We hypothesized that the imbalances in water economy may play a role in the timing of periodic arousals in hibernating species. We applied furosemide, a diuretic drug, to assess whether hibernating European ground squirrels respond to elevated urine production by shortening their torpor bouts. Urine production in the treated squirrels increased and led to more frequent arousals, presumably to restore water balance by recovery of lost water from blood and tissues. The length of the subsequent normothermic phase was not affected by the diuretic treatment. Body mass change correlated primarily with the amount of voided urine. Although our study did not identify the underlying mechanism, our results support the view that water economy, and water loss may play a role in the timing of periodic arousals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The role of seed availability for reproductive decisions in edible dormice,"The edible dormouse is a specialized seed predator which is highly adapted to the fluctuations of food availability caused by mast seeding of beech and oak trees. Dormice produce young just in time with maximum food availability, and can completely skip reproduction in years with a lack of seeding. Because their decision to reproduce or not in any particular year is made long before the ripe seeds are available, it seems that dormice can anticipate the upcoming mast situation. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of high caloric food in spring affects their reproductive decision. Therefore, we supplementary fed dormice in a field experiment from spring to early summer with sunflower seeds, which also contain a high amount of energy. Supplemental feeding caused significant increases in the proportion of reproducing females and reproductively active males. These results suggest that edible dormice may use the occurrence of an energy rich food resource to predict the autumnal mast situation. Further, our data indicate that the decision to reproduce was not the result of an increased body mass due to the consumption of surplus food, but that sufficient seed abundance acts as an environmental signal to which dormice adjust their reproduction.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To overcome these potential biases, we investigated the functional cardiac phenotype of the hibernating grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) during the active, transitional and hibernating phases over a 4 year period in conscious rather than anesthetized bears. The bears were captive born and serially studied from the age of 5 months to 4 years. Heart rate was significantly different from active (82.6 ± 7.7 beats/min) to hibernating states (17.8 ± 2.8 beats/min). There was no difference from the active to the hibernating state in diastolic and stroke volume parameters or in left atrial area. Left ventricular volume:mass was significantly increased during hibernation indicating decreased ventricular mass. Ejection fraction of the left ventricle was not different between active and hibernating states. In contrast, total left atrial emptying fraction was significantly reduced during hibernation (17.8 ± 2.8%) as compared to the active state (40.8 ± 1.9%). Reduced atrial chamber function was also supported by reduced atrial contraction blood flow velocities and atrial contraction ejection fraction during hibernation; 7.1 ± 2.8% as compared to 20.7 ± 3% during the active state. Changes in the diastolic cardiac filling cycle, especially atrial chamber contribution to ventricular filling, appear to be the most prominent macroscopic functional change during hibernation. Thus, we propose that these changes in atrial chamber function constitute a major adaptation during hibernation which allows the myocardium to conserve energy, avoid chamber dilation and remain healthy during a period of extremely low heart rates.

Present work was performed to uncover possible implication of protein kinases and protein phosphatases (PPs) in the regulation of baseline and volume-dependent KCC activity in these cells. K+ influx was estimated as 86Rb uptake by the cells in isotonic or hypotonic media in the presence of ouabain, K+ efflux was determined as the difference between K+ loss by the cells incubated in parallel in isotonic or hypotonic K+-free Cl−- and NO3−-media. Swelling of the cells in hypotonic medium was accompanied by approximately 50% activation of Cl-dependent K+ influx and efflux. Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor genistein (0.1 mM) stably and considerably (up to 89%) suppressed both baseline and volume-dependent KCC activity in each direction. Other PTK blockers (tyrphostin 23 and quercetin) had no influence on KCC activity in frog erythrocytes. PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (20 μM) and both PP inhibitors, fluoride (5 mM) and okadaic acid (1 μM), reduced KCC activity by 25–70%. Neither basal nor swelling-activated KCC in frog erythrocytes was affected by PKC inhibitor staurosporine (1 μM).

We aimed to investigate, using the Rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil, the potential role of the Rho-kinase pathway of Ca2+ sensitization in depolarization- and agonist-mediated contraction of chicken embryo (at day 19 of the 21 days of incubation) femoral arteries. Contraction elicited by KCl (125 mM) comprised two phases (phasic and tonic contraction), both of which were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Hydroxyfasudil (10 μM) left the initial phasic component nearly intact but abolished the tonic component. Hydroxyfasudil also induced a marked impairment of the contractions elicited by phenylephrine (PE), the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619, and endothelin-1. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) by chelerythrine did not affect KCl- or PE-induced contractions, indicating lack of participation of PKC-mediated Ca2+ sensitization. Incubation under chronic hypoxia (15% O2 from day 0) impaired embryonic growth but did not significantly affect hydroxyfasudil-mediated relaxation.

The data were implemented in a kinetic model of the rhodopsin–arrestin cycle, allowing us to estimate the active metarhodopsin concentration as a function of effective light intensity and arrestin concentration. Arrestin reduction in the mutant modestly increased the light sensitivity and decreased the photoreceptor dynamic range. Compared to the wild type, in the mutant the transition between full repolarization and PDA occurred at a lower metarhodopsin fraction and was more abrupt. We developed a steady-state stochastic model to interpret the dependence of the PDA on effective light intensity and arrestin content and to help deduce the arrestin to rhodopsin ratio from the sensitivity and PDA data.

Bath application of the octopamine agonist chlordimeform to the isolated central nervous system of adult moths reliably induces fictive flight patterns in wing depressor and elevator motoneurons. Pattern maturation is investigated by chlordimeform application at different developmental stages. Chlordimeform also induces motor patterns in larval ganglia, which differ from fictive flight, indicating that in larvae and adults, octopamine affects different networks. First changes in motoneuron activity occur at the pupal stage P10. Rhythmic motor output is induced in depressor, but not in elevator motoneurons at P12. Adult-like fictive flight activity in motoneurons is observed at P16 and increases in speed and precision until emergence 2 days later. Pharmacological block of chloride channels with picrotoxin also induces fictive flight in adults, suggesting that the pattern-generating network can be activated by the removal of inhibition, and that proper network function does not rely on GABAA receptors.

We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision.

We found that black phoebes have larger lateral visual fields than similarly sized ground-foraging passerines, as well as relatively narrower binocular and blind areas. Black phoebes moved their eyes, but eye movement amplitude was relatively smaller than in other passerines. Black phoebes may compensate for eye movement constraints with head movements. The rate of head movements increased before attacking prey in comparison to non-foraging contexts and before movements between perches. These findings suggest that black phoebes use their lateral visual fields, likely subtended by areas of high acuity in the retina, to track prey items in a three-dimensional space through active head movements. These head movements may increase depth perception, motion detection and tracking. Studying information gathering through head movement changes, rather than body posture changes (head-up, head-down) as generally presented in the literature, may allow us to better understand the mechanisms of information gathering from a comparative perspective.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This behavioral response must be more responsive to relevant motion (predators, prey, conspecifics) than to irrelevant motion (windblown vegetation). Early stages of visual motion detection rely on simple local circuits known as elementary motion detectors (EMDs). We presented a computer model consisting of a grid of correlation-type EMDs, with videos of natural motion patterns, including prey, predators and windblown vegetation. We systematically varied the model parameters and quantified the relative response to the different classes of motion. We carried out behavioral experiments with the lizard Anolis sagrei and determined that their visual response could be modeled with a grid of correlation-type EMDs with a spacing parameter of 0.3° visual angle, and a time constant of 0.1 s. The model with these parameters gave substantially stronger responses to relevant motion patterns than to windblown vegetation under equivalent conditions. However, the model is sensitive to local contrast and viewer-object distance. Therefore, additional neural processing is probably required for the visual system to reliably distinguish relevant from irrelevant motion under a full range of natural conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The present study investigates, in the labellar chemosensilla of the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae, the transduction mechanism by which saccharin evokes the response of the “deterrent” cell, with particular attention to the contribution of K+ and Ca2+ current and the role of cyclic nucleotides, since second messengers modulate Ca2+, Cl− and K+ currents to different extents. As assessed by extracellular single-sensillum recordings, our results show that the addition of a Ca2+ chelator such as EGTA or the Ca2+ current blockers SK&F-96365, Mibefradil, Nifedipine and W-7 decrease the response of the “deterrent” cell to saccharin. A similar decreasing effect was also obtained following the addition of 4-aminopyridine, a K+ current blocker. On the contrary, the membrane-permeable cyclic nucleotide 8-bromoguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cGMP) activates this cell and shows an additive effect when presented mixed with saccharin. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that in the labellar chemosensilla of the blowfly both Ca2+ and K+ ions are involved in the transduction mechanism of the “deterrent” cell in response to saccharin. Our results also suggest a possible pathway common to saccharin and 8Br-cGMP.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Estivation is similar to the diapause and hibernation of other animal species in that it is characterized by negligible activity and a profoundly depressed metabolic rate. As is typically observed in quiescent states, estivating P. dolloi are resistant to environmental stresses. We tested the hypothesis that P. dolloi enhances stress resistance during estivation by upregulating intracellular antioxidant defences in brain and heart tissues. We found that most of the major intracellular antioxidant enzymes, including the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cytosolic superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, were upregulated in brain tissue of lungfish that had estivated for 60 days. Several of these enzymes were also elevated in heart tissue of estivators. These changes were not due to food deprivation, as they did not occur in a group of fish that were deprived of food but maintained in water for the same period of time. We found little evidence of tissue oxidative damage in estivators. Products of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxynonenal adducts) and oxidative protein damage (carbonylation) were similar in estivating and control lungfish. However, protein nitrotyrosine levels were elevated in brain tissue of estivators. Taken together, these data indicate that estivating P. dolloi have enhanced oxidative stress resistance in brain and heart due to a significant upregulation of intracellular antioxidant capacity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated the effects of physiological and behavioural strategies on the energetics of the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata). Metabolic rate and body temperature during torpor, basking and rest were measured over 24 h in response to simulated environmental conditions: (a) constant ambient temperature (Ta) of 15°C, (b) constant Ta of 15°C with access to a radiant heat lamp, (c) a Ta cycle (range 15–31°C), and (d) a Ta cycle with access to a radiant heat lamp. When a radiant heat source was provided, all dunnarts (n = 16) basked during all measurements, which resulted in energy savings of up to 74% during rest. Overall, torpor was used on 59% of measurements with a maximum duration of 16.2 h and reductions in metabolic rate of 90% compared to normothermic values. Torpid dunnarts actively moved from a shaded area to position themselves under the heat lamp with body temperatures as low as 17.5°C and thereby reduced rewarming costs by 66%. We demonstrated, for the first time in the laboratory, that torpid animals actively move to a heat source to bask, and that this behaviour results in considerable energy savings. Our finding supports the view that basking during normothermia and rewarming from torpor substantially reduces energetic requirements, which may be important for the survival of small dasyurids living on limited resources in the Australian arid zone.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Terrestrial snakes, lizards, and turtles migrate short distances (<20 km) between seasonal habitats, whereas fully aquatic marine turtles migrate hundreds to thousands of kilometers between foraging and breeding areas. The purpose of this article is to summarize aspects of migratory physiology and behavior in reptiles, particularly with regards to energetics and sensory mechanisms for navigation and orientation. We discuss the influence of aerobic scope, endurance, and cost of transport on migratory capacity, the effects of temperature and circulating hormones on activity and behavior, and mechanisms of detecting and transducing environmental cues to successfully navigate and orient toward a goal during migration.

Recent studies working with environmentally relevant CO2 levels, indicate that some echinoderms and molluscs reduce metabolic rates, soft tissue growth and calcification during hypercapnic exposure. In contrast to all prior invertebrate species studied so far, growth trials with the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis found no indication of reduced growth or calcification performance during long-term exposure to 0.6 kPa CO2. It is hypothesized that the differing sensitivities to elevated seawater pCO2 could be explained by taxa specific differences in acid–base regulatory capacity. In this study, we examined the acid–base regulatory ability of S. officinalis in vivo, using a specially modified cannulation technique as well as 31P NMR spectroscopy. During acute exposure to 0.6 kPa CO2, S. officinalis rapidly increased its blood [HCO3−] to 10.4 mM through active ion-transport processes, and partially compensated the hypercapnia induced respiratory acidosis. A minor decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) and stable intracellular phosphagen levels indicated efficient pHi regulation. We conclude that S. officinalis is not only an efficient acid–base regulator, but is also able to do so without disturbing metabolic equilibria in characteristic tissues or compromising aerobic capacities. The cuttlefish did not exhibit acute intolerance to hypercapnia that has been hypothesized for more active cephalopod species (squid). Even though blood pH (pHe) remained 0.18 pH units below control values, arterial O2 saturation was not compromised in S. officinalis because of the comparatively lower pH sensitivity of oxygen binding to its blood pigment. This raises questions concerning the potentially broad range of sensitivity to changes in acid–base status amongst invertebrates, as well as to the underlying mechanistic origins. Further studies are needed to better characterize the connection between acid–base status and animal fitness in various marine species.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Branchial oxygen consumption was measured under normo- versus hypercapnic conditions (10,000 ppm CO2) at high extracellular pH values. The fractional costs of ion regulation, protein and RNA synthesis in the energy budgets were determined using specific inhibitors. Overall gill energy turnover was maintained under pH compensated hypercapnia in both Antarctic species as well as in a temperate zoarcid (Zoarces viviparus). However, fractional energy consumption by the examined processes rose drastically in G. gibberifrons (100–180%), and to a lesser extent in N. coriiceps gills (7–56%).

Immunoblotting was used to analyze levels of active and inactive forms of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), nuclear translocation of HSF1, and the levels of six heat shock proteins (HSPs). PCR was also used to retrieve the turtle HSF1 nucleotide sequence; its deduced amino acid sequence showed 97% identity with chicken HSF1. White skeletal muscle showed a strong fivefold increase in the amount of active HSF1 under anoxic conditions as well as an 80% increase in nuclear localization. This was accompanied by upregulation of five HSPs by 1.8- to 2.9-fold: Hsp25, Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsc70, and Hsp90, the latter two remained elevated after 5 h of aerobic recovery. Kidney and liver showed little change in active HSF1 content during anoxia and recovery, but a significant increase in the nuclear localization of HSF1 during anoxia. This supported enhanced expression of three HSPs in kidney (Hsp40, Hsc70, and Hsp90) and four in liver (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsc70). Heart displayed a strong increase in active HSF1 during anoxia and recovery (6.6- to 6.8-fold higher than control) and increased nuclear localization but heart HSP levels did not rise.

In flies, the processing of optic flow is performed by motion sensitive tangential cells in the lobula plate. Amongst them, cells of the vertical system (VS cells) have receptive fields with similarities to optic flows generated during rotations around different body axes. Their output signals are further processed by pre-motor descending neurons. Here, we investigate the local motion preferences of two descending neurons called descending neurons of the ocellar and vertical system (DNOVS1 and DNOVS2). Using an LED arena subtending 240° × 95° of visual space, we mapped the receptive fields of DNOVS1 and DNOVS2 as well as those of their presynaptic elements, i.e. VS cells 1–10 and V2. The receptive field of DNOVS1 can be predicted in detail from the receptive fields of those VS cells that are most strongly coupled to the cell. The receptive field of DNOVS2 is a combination of V2 and VS cells receptive fields. Predicting the global motion preferences from the receptive field revealed a linear spatial integration in DNOVS1 and a superlinear spatial integration in DNOVS2. In addition, the superlinear integration of V2 output is necessary for DNOVS2 to differentiate between a roll rotation and a lift translation of the fly.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The importance of having an inbuilt “detect and protect” system is illustrated by the fact that most animals have dedicated sensory afferents which respond to noxious stimuli called nociceptors. Should injury occur there is often sensitization, whereby increased nociceptor sensitivity and/or plasticity of nociceptor-related neural circuits acts as a protection mechanism for the afflicted body part. Studying nociception and nociceptors in different model organisms has demonstrated that there are similarities from invertebrates right through to humans. The development of technology to genetically manipulate organisms, especially mice, has led to an understanding of some of the key molecular players in nociceptor function. This review will focus on what is known about nociceptors throughout the Animalia kingdom and what similarities exist across phyla; especially at the molecular level of ion channels.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It contains the extensively modulated central pattern generators that drive the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (food filtering) rhythms. Neuromodulators affect all stages of neuronal processing in this system, from membrane currents and synaptic transmission in network neurons to the properties of the effector muscles. The ease with which distinct neurons are identified and their activity is recorded in this system has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which neuromodulators affect their target cells and modulatory neuron function. Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulators are involved in homeostatic processes and that the modulatory system itself is under modulatory control, a fascinating topic whose surface has been barely scratched.

Although natural selection acts upon organismal traits such as performance (e.g., burst, sustained metabolic rates), from a mechanistic perspective, organismal performance results from the integrated functioning of different levels of biological organization. Hence, a better understanding of whole-animal performance must necessarily incorporate an explicit analysis of the integration between those different levels. Although this topic has been under intense scrutiny, overall there have been very few consistent patterns. Here, we explore the phenotypic integration between organ masses and the overall energy budget under routine capacities by statistically decomposing the covariance matrix (using path analysis and canonical correlation analysis) between organ masses and thermoregulatory burst and sustained metabolisms in cold acclimated individuals of Phyllotis darwini. Our results suggest that (a) central organs associated with the processing of food (cecum and liver), residuals (kidneys) and pumping of O2 (heart) are tightly integrated to sustained expenditure and between themselves; (b) with the exception of the heart, central energy supplying organs are weakly related to burst expenditures; (c) sustained and burst metabolisms refer to complete different strategies and (d) basal metabolic rate is not related to any of the physiological or morphological traits considered in this study. Overall, our results support the hypothesis of an economic phenotype: animals maintain their excess capacities to face those critical extreme events, but their physiology and internal morphology are tightly integrated to function under routine needs.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This variability is elicited by changes in photoperiod and often covaries with fluctuations in both energy reserves and reproductive state. It is unclear, however, whether changes in either variable alone drive seasonal changes in immunity. We investigated the relative contributions of reproduction and energy balance to changes in immune function. To accomplish this, we uncoupled seasonal changes in reproduction from those related to energy balance via daily injections of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). NMDA is a glutamatergic agonist that blocks short day-induced gonadal regression, while leaving short-day declines in body mass unaffected. In Experiment 1, we examined the effect of differing doses of NMDA on testosterone production as a proxy for NMDA effects on reproduction; a dose-dependent rise in testosterone was observed. In Experiment 2, animals were maintained on long or short days and received daily injections of NMDA. After 8 weeks, all animals underwent a humoral immune challenge. Short-day animals receiving daily injections of NMDA maintained long day-like gonads; however, contrary to our predictions, no trade-off between reproduction or energy balance and immune function was observed. Unexpectedly, NMDA treatment increased immunoglobulin levels in all groups, suggesting that NMDA may provide an immunomodulatory signal, presumably through actions on peripheral glutamate receptors. These results support a previous finding that NMDA blocks reproductive regression. In addition, these findings demonstrate a general immunoenhancing effect of NMDA that appears independent of changes in reproductive or energetic state of the animal.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hatched chicks that had spent the last 24 h of incubation in artificial severe hypoxia showed a rise in muscle (+50%) and heart (+69%) lipid peroxidation, an increased susceptibility of red blood cells to free radicals, a marked over-expression of avUCP mRNA (+105%) and a rise in mitochondrial ANT content (+54%).

We analyzed the approach and the precise contact of the antennal tips with the floral guide of artificial flowers which precedes landing and inspection. Both bumblebees and honeybees were able to make antennal contact with circular floral guides which were 2 mm in diameter; bumblebees performed better than honeybees and antennated also at floral guides smaller than 2 mm. In discrimination experiments with bumblebees, a minimum floral guide size of 2 mm was required for discrimination between artificial flowers with and without floral guides. With increasing experience bumblebees targeted close to the site of reward instead of making antennal contact with the floral guide, whereas honeybees did not alter their initial behaviour with growing experience.

We determined the features and responses of single hindbrain and midbrain auditory neurons to tone bursts and playbacks of conspecific sounds in the soniferous damselfish, Abudefduf abdominalis. Most auditory neurons were either silent or had slow irregular resting discharge rates <20 spikes s−1. Average best frequency for neurons to tone stimuli was ~130 Hz but ranged from 80 to 400 Hz with strong phase-locking. This low-frequency sensitivity matches the frequency band of natural sounds. Auditory neurons were also modulated by playbacks of conspecific sounds with thresholds similar to 100 Hz tones, but these thresholds were lower than that of tones at other test frequencies. Thresholds of neurons to natural sounds were lower in the midbrain than the hindbrain. This is the first study to compare response properties of auditory neurons to both simple tones and complex stimuli in the brain of a recently derived soniferous perciform that lacks accessory auditory structures. These data demonstrate that the auditory fish brain is most sensitive to the frequency and temporal components of natural pulsed sounds that provide important signals for conspecific communication.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Survival of rat slices was significantly poorer than for birds under all conditions. Results suggest that (1) duck cerebellar neurons are intrinsically more hypoxia-tolerant than chicken neurons; (2) avian neurons are more hypoxia-tolerant than rat neurons, and (3) the enhanced hypoxic tolerance of duck neurons largely depended on efficient anaerobiosis since it mainly manifested itself in chemical anoxia.

When the intraciliary Ca2+ concentration associated with plasma membrane depolarization increases, a reversal in the direction of ciliary beating occurs, and consequently the swimming direction changes. The ciliary reversal duration is correlated with the amount of Ca2+ influx. The present study demonstrates that the duration of continuous ciliary reversal (CCR), triggered by high external KCl concentrations, is longer in euplotin C-treated cells. Using selective Ca2+ channel blockers, we demonstrate that euplotin C modulates Ca2+ channels similar to the T- and L-types that occur in mammalian cells. Indeed, the increase of CCR duration significantly decreased when flunarizine and nimodipine-verapamil blockers were employed. Membrane fluidity measurements using a fluorescent dye, 6-lauroyl-2-dimethylaminonaphtalene (laurdan), indicated that membranes in euplotin C-treated cells are more tightly packed and ordered than membranes in control cells. Our data suggest that euplotin C enhances backward swimming in our unicellular model system by interacting with the ciliary Ca2+ channel functions through the reduction of cell membrane fluidity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

While this gene is expressed continuously in nondiapausing females reared under long-day conditions, it is strongly down-regulated 5–18 days after adult eclosion in females reared under the short-day conditions that induce diapause. The possibility that this shut-down in expression of rpS2 contributes to the arrest in ovarian development characteristic of diapause is bolstered by the diapause-like arrest in follicle growth observed when nondiapausing females are injected with dsrpS2. A control gene encoding another ribosomal protein, L19, is expressed equally in nondiapausing and diapausing females, and RNA interference directed against rpL19 did not arrest follicle growth, thus indicating that the response we observed in knocking down expression of rpS2 is not common to all ribosomal proteins. Diapause in C. pipiens is readily terminated with juvenile hormone (JH), and in this study we demonstrated that an exogenous application of JHIII can rescue the arrest in follicle growth caused by dsrpS2. Together, these results suggest that rpS2 plays a critical role in arresting the ovarian development associated with diapause in this mosquito.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In search of functional differences between the two cell types due to differences in stimulus transmission, we analyzed (1) the adaptation of responses to electrical stimulation, (2) the thresholds for mechanical stimulation and (3) the representation of male courtship vibrations using intracellular recording and staining techniques. Single- and multi-spiking receptor neurons were found among both cell types, which showed high-pass filter characteristics. Below 100-Hz threshold, tarsal deflections were between 1° and 10°. At higher frequencies, they decreased down to values as small as 0.05°, corresponding to 4.5-nm tarsal deflection in the most sensitive cases. Different slits in the organ and receptor cells with slow or fast adaptation did not differ in this regard. When stimulated with male courtship vibrations, both types of receptor cells again did not differ significantly regarding number of action potentials, latency and synchronization coefficients.

Space saving hydraulic leg extension enables leg segments, which consist almost soley of flexor muscles. As a result, the muscle cross sectional area is high despite slender legs. Considering these morphological features in context with the spider’s segmented C-shaped legs, these specifics might influence the spider’s muscle properties. Moreover, these properties have to be known for modeling of spider locomotion. Cupiennius salei (n = 5) were fixed in a metal frame allowing exclusive flexion of the tibia–metatarsus joint of the second leg (counted from anterior). Its flexing muscles were stimulated supramaximally using needle electrodes. Accounting for the joint geometry, the force–length and the force–velocity relationships were determined. The spider muscles produce 0.07 N cm maximum isometric moment (corresponding to 25 N/cm2 maximum stress) at 160° tibia–metatarsus joint angle. When overextended to the dorsal limit at approximately 200°, the maximum isometric moments decrease to 72%, and, when flexed to the ventral hinge stop at 85°, they drop to 11%. The force–velocity relation shows the typical hyperbolic shape. The mean maximum shortening velocity is 5.7 optimum muscle lengths per second and the mean curvature (a/Fiso) of the Hill-function is 0.34. The spider muscle’s properties which were determined are similar to those of other species acting as motors during locomotion (working range, curvature of Hill hyperbola, peak power at the preferred speeds), but they are relatively slow. In conjunction with the low mechanical advantage (muscle lever/load arm), the arrangement of three considerably actuated joints in series may nonetheless enable high locomotion velocities.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Torpor occurred only in the winter and was associated with lower normothermic Tb, during inter-bout arousal periods than in the summer. Chipmunks increased body mass before the initiation of torpor in winter, and steadily lost mass as the hibernation season progressed. Torpor expression was correlated to initial mass gain, with the individuals who showed the largest mass increase in the fall showing the highest degree of torpor. Acclimation to winter-like conditions produced a decline in normothermic MR at all ambient temperatures examined. The findings indicate that torpor expression is accompanied by a decrease in Tb and MR during normothermy, indicating that a conservation of energy metabolism occurs, not only in torpor, but also during the inter-bout arousal periods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Audiograms showed peak sensitivity between 8 and 24 kHz, with higher thresholds at lower and higher frequencies. In the second experiment, thresholds for gap detection in broadband and narrowband noise bursts were measured at several sensation levels. For broadband noise, gap thresholds were between 1 and 2 ms, except at very low sensation levels, where thresholds increased significantly. Gap thresholds also increased significantly for low pass-filtered noise bursts with a cutoff frequency below 18 kHz.

To investigate this question for the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, pattern envelopes were constructed by the addition of several sine waves and modified by systematic phase changes. The phonotactic response of female crickets towards such sinusoidal but also rectangular pulse patterns was quantified on a locomotion compensator. Envelope patterns that exhibited a modulation frequency of 25 Hz as the dominant frequency were attractive and although changes of phase modified the temporal pattern, the values of attractiveness remained unaffected. Removal of the 25-Hz component reduced the phonotactic scores. Patterns in which other frequency components exhibited a larger amplitude than the 25-Hz component were less attractive. However, the combination of an unattractive pulse period with the attractive modulation frequency of 25 Hz in a pattern revealed that such stimuli were unattractive despite the presence of the 25-Hz component. A comparison of the attractiveness of all patterns revealed that female crickets evaluated the duration of pulse period over a wide range of duty cycles. The combined evidence showed that pattern envelopes were processed in the time- and not in the spectral domain.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It was assumed that hair fields between the main segments of the body and between the proximal leg segments contribute to graviception which triggers a change of posture in response to substrate slopes. The sagittal kinematics of two ant species were investigated and compared on different slopes. Cataglyphis fortis, a North African desert ant, is well known for its extraordinary sense of orientation in texturally almost uniform habitats, while Formica pratensis, a common central-European species, primarily uses landmarks and pheromone traces for orientation. A comparison of these two species reveals differences in postural adaptations during inclined locomotion. Only minor slope-dependent angular adjustments were observed. The largest is a 25° head rotation for Cataglyphis, even if the slope is changed by 150°, suggesting dramatic changes in the field of vision. The trunk’s pitch adjustment towards the increasing slope is low in both species. On all slopes Cataglyphis achieves higher running speeds than Formica and displays greater slope-dependent variation in body height. This indicates different strategies for coping with changing slopes. These specific aspects have to be reflected in the ants’ respective mode of slope perception.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The evolution of such differences may be important in the process of speciation. Selection for signal detectability under different habitat conditions has been proposed as a mechanism leading to the evolution of signal diversity. We examined dewlap color in four closely related species of Anolis lizards that occupy habitats with different light conditions. Initially, we tested the hypothesis that lizards choose specific light conditions within each habitat in which to signal. We rejected this hypothesis for all four species. We next calculated the detectability of the dewlap color of all four species at display locations in each habitat. If selection for detectability under the different light conditions explained the divergence in signal design, the occupant of a given habitat was predicted to have the highest signal detectability in that habitat. However, the rank order of detectability of the four dewlap colors was nearly the same in all four habitats. We concluded that divergent selection for signal detectability does not, by itself, explain the evolution of dewlap color diversity. We hypothesize that the evolution of dewlap color diversity results from simultaneous selection for multiple functions of dewlap color.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, at a given mass, there remains a large amount of variation in BMR. While many researchers suggest that the overall scaling of BMR with body mass is due to physiological constraints, variation at a given body mass may provide clues as to how selection acts on BMR. Here, we examine this variation in BMR in a broad sample of mammals and we test the hypothesis that, across mammals, body composition explains differences in BMR at a given body mass. Variation in BMR is strongly correlated with variation in muscle mass, and both of these variables are correlated with latitude and ambient temperature. These results suggest that selection alters BMR in response to thermoregulatory pressures, and that selection uses muscle mass as a means to generate this variation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Saiphos equalis is an Australian scincid lizard with a reproductive mode that is uncommon for squamates because eggs are retained in the oviduct until late developmental stages, and the embryonic stage at oviposition varies geographically. We studied calcium mobilization by embryos in two populations with different oviductal egg retention patterns to test the hypothesis that the pattern of nutritional provision of calcium is independent of the embryonic stage at oviposition. Females from one population are viviparous and oviposit eggs containing fully formed embryos, whereas embryos in oviposited eggs of the second population are morphologically less mature, and these eggs hatch several days later. The reproductive mode of this population is denoted as prolonged oviductal egg retention. Yolk provided the highest proportion of calcium to hatchlings in both populations. Eggs of both populations were enclosed in calcified eggshells, but shells of the population with prolonged egg retention had twice the calcium content of the viviparous population and embryos recovered calcium from these eggshells. Placental transfer accounted for a substantial amount of calcium in hatchlings in both populations. Hatchling calcium concentration was higher in the population with prolonged egg retention because these embryos mobilized calcium from yolk, the eggshell and the placenta. This pattern of embryonic calcium provision in which both a calcified eggshell and placentotrophy contribute to embryonic nutrition is novel. The reproductive pattern of S. equalis illustrates that calcified eggshells are compatible with prolonged oviductal egg retention and that viviparity is not requisite to calcium placentotrophy.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here we investigate how the protein to carbohydrate ratio of diets affects the mass of the gastrointestinal tract in mice. We fed 6-week-old male mice one of five isocaloric diets differing only in protein to carbohydrate ratio (the “no-choice” treatments), while a further four treatment groups received nutritionally complementary food pairings from which they could self-select a diet (the “choice” treatments). After 32 days, we measured the resulting dry mass of stomachs, intestines, caeca and colons. In the no-choice treatments, the stomachs were heavier in the mice fed diets containing more protein and less carbohydrate, indicating that larger stomachs may be needed for efficient digestion of the protein-rich food. In contrast, intestines, caeca and colons were heavier when diets contained more carbohydrates and less protein. This response may function to increase the digestive rate of carbohydrates when the dietary content of this macronutrient increases, but it may also indicate a compensatory response to increase amino acid uptake from a protein-deficient food. Mice in the choice treatments self-selected a diet with a protein to carbohydrate ratio of 0.46, and had gut dimensions similar to the expectation derived from no-choice treatments for this diet composition.

We introduced several diets containing orcinol and a buffer (urinary alkalising agent) over a course of three experiments. A diet containing 2% orcinol (wet matter) caused possums to reduce their food intake immediately, but feeding returned to normal 1–2 days later. Even though possums excreted strongly acidic urine (pH 5.1) and had perturbed nitrogen metabolism, they maintained their food intake and body mass until the experiment terminated 9 days after the introduction of orcinol. Possums ate 52% less when the basal diet contained 4% orcinol. As expected, the acid loads caused a change in the composition of urinary nitrogen with possums excreting more ammonium than urea and a large amount of unidentified nitrogenous material. Supplementing the diet containing orcinol with buffer neutralised the metabolic acid load and partly restored normal nitrogen metabolism, but did not restore feeding. Also, animals eating orcinol excreted normal amounts of 3-methylhistidine, indicating no increase in muscle protein catabolism. This suggests that a limitation to the rate of detoxification or toxicosis, rather than acid loads, limits the ingestion of acid-inducing PSMs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We observed no significant spiking response changes in the predicted direction to any of the frequencies tested following exposure to HIS and we observed only two of the 24 predicted time-dependent changes to A1 firing. These results indicate that tympanal up-tuning does not result in a change to this moth’s auditory frequency sensitivity and we suggest either sensillar resonances or increases in thoracic muscle tension following exposure to HIS as alternative explanations.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The efficient osmoregulator, Callinectes sapidus, displayed an immediate increase in oxygen uptake when exposed to low salinity in isolation. In contrast, the weak osmoregulator, Cancer magister, showed no change in oxygen uptake upon acute exposure (<6 h), but slight increases in oxygen uptake tended to occur over longer time scales (12–24 h). These changes were likely attributable to an increase in avoidance activity after 6 h hyposaline exposure. Following feeding in 100% SW, oxygen uptake doubled for both species and remained elevated for 15 h. When postprandial crabs were exposed to low salinities, C. sapidus were able to sum the demands of osmoregulation and digestion. Thus, gastric processes continued unabated in low salinity. Conversely, postprandial C. magister prioritized responses to low salinity over those of digestion, resulting in a decrease in oxygen uptake when exposed to low salinity. This decrease in oxygen uptake corresponded to a reduction in the rate of contraction of the pyloric stomach and a subsequent doubling of gastric evacuation time.

We used the electro-olfactogram (EOG) technique to compare the relative response of the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) olfactory epithelium to 20 proteinogenic amino acids and determine the sensitivity for 6 amino acids. At micromolar concentrations, cysteine evoked the greatest EOG response which was approximately twice as large as that of alanine. The weakest response was obtained for proline followed by aspartic acid and isoleucine. The olfactory epithelium showed adaptation to sequential stimulation, and recovery was related to the inter-stimulus time period. Estimated EOG response thresholds were in the sub-nanomolar range for both alanine (9.2 × 10−11 M) and cysteine (8.4 × 10−10 M) and in the micromolar range for proline and serine. These thresholds from 10−10 to 10−6 M for the scalloped hammerhead shark are comparable or lower than those reported for other teleost and elasmobranch species.

Here, we compare the respiratory response to confinement stress, and behavioral responses to ecologically relevant challenges among sticklebacks from 11 different populations varying in predation pressure. We found that sticklebacks from high predation populations breathed faster in response to confinement stress and were, on an average, more behaviorally responsive to a pike behind glass compared with sticklebacks from low predation populations. These patterns differ from the results of studies on other species, highlighting the need for a conceptual framework to understand the proximate and ultimate factors shaping variable responses to stressors over developmental and evolutionary time. Moreover, physiological and behavioral responses were integrated with each other, both at the individual and population levels.

As such, the objective of the current study was to determine: (i) if the response of decreased protein synthesis is conserved across environmental stressors and (ii) if the response of metabolic depression is conserved across levels of cellular organization. This was accomplished through the measurement of in vivo protein synthesis rates in the whole tissue, cytosolic and mitochondrial protein pools (reflective of nuclear encoded proteins imported into mitochondria) of heart and gill in cunner exposed to either acute low temperature (8–4°C) or acute hypoxia (10% O2 saturation). In both heart and gill, rates of protein synthesis in the whole tissue and cytosolic protein pools were substantially depressed by 80% in response to acute hypothermia. In hypoxic heart, protein synthesis was significantly decreased by 50–60% in the whole tissue, cytosolic and mitochondrial pools; however, in gill there was no significant difference in rates of protein synthesis in any cellular fraction between normoxic and hypoxic groups. Most strikingly the rate of new protein accumulation in the mitochondrial fraction of gill did not change in response to either a decrease in temperature or hypoxia.

Total red muscle area was unaltered after 4 weeks of training. The mRNA expression of CS was unaffected in red muscle, while it was increased in white muscle after 1 week of training and remained elevated at 8 weeks of training, suggesting an increase in oxidative capacity of this fiber type. In contrast, PGC-1α mRNA was elevated in both muscles only after 1 week of training. In both muscles, an acute bout of exercise rapidly (within 0–2 h post-exercise) induced PGC-1α mRNA and a delayed (24 h) increase in CS mRNA post-exercise.

After having applied Finite Element (FE) analysis to simplified arrays of five straight slits (Hößl et al. J Comp Physiol A 193:445–459, 2007) we now present a computational study of the effects of more subtle natural variations in geometry, number and arrangement of slits on the slit face deformations. Our simulations show that even minor variations in these parameters can substantially influence a slit’s directional response. Using white-light interferometric measurements of the surface deformations of a lyriform organ, it is shown that planar FE models are capable of predicting the principal characteristics of the mechanical responses. The magnitudes of the measured and calculated slit face deformations are in good agreement. At threshold, they measure between 1.7 and 43 nm. In a lyriform organ and a closely positioned loose group of slits, the detectable range of loads increases to approximately 3.5 times the range of the lyriform organ alone. Stress concentration factors (up to ca. 29) found in the vicinity of the slits were evaluated from the models. They are mitigated due to local thickening of the exocuticle and the arrangement of the chitinous microfibers that prevents the formation of cracks under physiological loading conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Echolocating bats may have evolved specialized vocal strategies for echolocating in noise, but also seem to exhibit generic vertebrate responses such as the ubiquitous Lombard response. We wondered how bats balance generic and echolocation-specific vocal responses to noise. To address this question, we first characterized the vocal responses of flying free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) to broadband noises varying in amplitude. Secondly, we measured the bats’ responses to band-limited noises that varied in the extent of overlap with their echolocation pulse bandwidth. We hypothesized that the bats’ generic responses to noise would be graded proportionally with noise amplitude, total bandwidth and frequency content, and consequently that more selective responses to band-limited noise such as the jamming avoidance response could be explained by a linear decomposition of the response to broadband noise. Instead, the results showed that both the nature and the magnitude of the vocal responses varied with the acoustic structure of the outgoing pulse as well as non-linearly with noise parameters. We conclude that free-tailed bats utilize separate generic and specialized vocal responses to noise in a context-dependent fashion.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The independent effects of temperature and day length in the determination of dormancy have been examined only in one long-established laboratory line (Canton-S). In all other studies of natural or laboratory populations, dormancy has been assessed at either a single short day or a single moderately low temperature. Herein, we determine the relative roles of temperature, photoperiod, and their interaction in the control of ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster from two natural populations representing latitudinal extremes in eastern North America (Florida at 27°N and Maine at 44°N). In both natural populations, temperature is the main determinant of dormancy, alone explaining 67% of the total variation among replicate isofemale lines, whereas photoperiod has no significant effect. We conclude that ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster is a temperature-initiated syndrome of winter-tolerant traits that represents an adaptive phenotypic plasticity in temperate seasonal environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The effects of diet were assessed in freshwater (FW) following 104 days of diet manipulation, in response to 24-h seawater (SW) transfer at this time, and following an additional 35 days of SW acclimation. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity was not significantly affected by diet at any sampling time, and there were no consistent effects of diet on the expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase α1a isoform. As dietary CO increased, Na+/K+-ATPase α1b mRNA decreased in fish held in FW, with the 43CO and 54CO diet groups having significantly lower levels than fish fed the 0CO and 11CO diets. Twenty-four-hour SW challenge did not affect the expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase α1a isoform in any diet group, but this isoform was down-regulated in all diet groups following 35 days of SW acclimation. Na+/K+-ATPase α1b expression levels increased in response to 24-h SW transfer and SW acclimation only in fish fed the 54CO diet. The effects of the two extreme diets (0CO and 54CO) were also assessed at various time points during 104 days of rearing in FW. Na+/K+-ATPase α1b mRNA levels were greater in fish fed diet 0CO versus those fed diet 54CO at all times during the FW culture period.

All males showed elevated levels in winter and low levels in autumn. In neither season did testosterone correlate with fitness-related parameters. However, two different endocrinological phenotypes existed in spring and summer. Whilst some males lowered their testosterone to levels comparable to autumnal quiescence (Type 1), others maintained elevated levels comparable to those during winter (Type 2). In spring and summer high levels were correlated with lower body condition and increased parasite burden, and Type 2 males tended to suffer higher mortality rates than Type 1. No animals older than 6 years adopted phenotype 2, indicating that males either switch phenotypes with age or that Type 2 results in lower life expectancy, evidencing the costs of male reproduction in badgers.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Males respond to the female-produced sex pheromone released from a piezo nebulizer in a dose-dependent manner in a wind tunnel: <50% arrive at the source at 5–50 pg/min (underdosed), 80% arrive at 100 pg/min to 10 ng/min (optimal) and <20% arrive at 100 ng/min (overdosed).

In the leech, LTD is observed in a polysynaptic connection between touch mechanosensory neurons (T cells) and the S interneuron following low frequency stimulation. LTD elicited by 450 s low frequency stimulation was blocked by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists. However, LTD elicited by 900 s low frequency stimulation was insensitive to NMDA receptor antagonists and was instead dependent on cannabinoid signaling. This LTD was blocked by both a cannabinoid receptor antagonist and by inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase, which is necessary for the synthesis of the cannabinoid transmitter 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG). Bath application of 2-AG or the cannabinoid receptor agonist CP55 940 also induced LTD at this synapse. These results indicate that two forms of LTD coexist at the leech T-to-S polysynaptic pathway: one that is NMDA receptor-dependent and another that is cannabinoid-dependent and that activation of either form of LTD is dependent on the level of activity in this circuit.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

When feeding on prey at small azimuths (less than ± 40°), frogs aimed their heads toward the prey but did not aim their tongues relative to their heads. Frogs projected their tongues rapidly by transferring momentum from the lower jaw to the tongue. Storage and recovery of elastic energy by the mouth opening muscles amplified the velocities of mouth opening and tongue projection. This behavior can only occur when the lower jaw and tongue are aligned (i.e., within the range of motion of the neck). When feeding on prey at large azimuths (greater than ± 40°), frogs aimed both the head and tongue toward the prey and used a muscular hydrostatic mechanism to project the tongue. Hydrostatic elongation allows for frogs to capture prey at greater azimuthal locations. Because the tongue moves independently of the lower jaw, frogs can no longer take advantage of momentum transfer to amplify the speed of tongue projection. To feed on prey at different azimuthal locations, tomato frogs switch between alternative strategies to circumvent these biomechanical constraints.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This powerful method provides information about diets over an extended time period (e.g., 2–4 weeks), rather than just the most recent meal as with most traditional approaches. Using consumer FA signatures, along with a comprehensive database of diet FA signatures, and accounting for consumer FA metabolism, it is possible to estimate the proportions of diet items in the consumer’s diet using quantitative FA signature analysis (QFASA). However, before applying QFASA to free-ranging populations, ideally, controlled feeding studies are performed to determine FA deposition and turnover characteristics. We conducted feeding experiments to validate QFASA in captive spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) and Steller’s eiders (Polysticta stelleri) as a minimally invasive method for studying the diets of these threatened species. We determined FA deposition in eider adipose tissue relative to long-term diet, and developed calibration coefficients (CCs) to account for eider lipid metabolism. Using these CCs with subsequent diet trials, QFASA accurately indicated diet and diet switches. QFASA estimates also indicated that turnover of dietary FAs was not complete by 21 or 29 days, and confirmed that diets could be estimated over an extended period of >29 days. Thus, our understanding of diet can be backtracked to more than a month in captive feeding eiders. We conclude that applying QFASA techniques to eiders and other birds in the wild has the potential to provide valuable information about their diets at various life history stages.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Byssogenesis rates and absorption efficiency values were significantly reduced after spawning of individuals. However, the maintenance of individuals under sub-optimal conditions (lack of microalgae in the diet) for a week caused no effect on thread’s number. Surprisingly, the attachment force varied within a narrow range of values (1.7–1.9 N) with the exception of a significant drop in the experimental group spawned and kept unfed (1.0 N; P < 0.001), most likely due to a similar pattern of the thread’s thickness variability. Qualitative analysis concerned to the amino acid composition of the byssus highlighted a higher presence of the basic residues histidine and lysine in threads secreted by spawned individuals. The presence of both histidine and lysine residues in the byssal collagen is associated to the formation of cross-links and specifically histidine has a functionality with a pronounced effect on metal chelation to stabilise the integrity of the byssus. Results reported here evidence the necessity to integrate all components that eventually determines the attachment strength of the mussels to get more insight to the plasticity of such secretion. Morphology of the byssus (thickness) secreted under different endogenous conditions of mussels was the major parameter to explain variability in the attachment force. Moreover, aminoacidic composition as quality term of the byssus secreted may also contribute to understand the plasticity of this secretion and needs to be extended in further surveys.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Different methods of hormone measurement exist, potentially explaining variation in results across studies; methods should be cross-validated to ensure that they correlate. We directly compared faecal and plasma hormone measurements for the first time in a wild free-living species, the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Blood and faecal samples were simultaneously collected from individual penguins for comparison and assayed for testosterone and corticosterone (or their metabolites). Sex differences and variability within each measure, and correlation of values across measures were compared. For both hormones, plasma samples showed greater variation than faecal samples. Males had higher mean corticosterone concentrations than females, but the difference was only statistically significant in faecal samples. Plasma testosterone, but not faecal testosterone, was significantly higher in males than females. Correlation between sample types was poor overall, and weaker in females than in males, perhaps because measures from plasma represent hormones that are both free and bound to globulins, whereas measures from faeces represent only the free portion. Faecal samples also represent a cumulative measure of hormones over time, as opposed to a plasma ‘snapshot’ concentration. Our data indicate that faecal sampling appears more suitable for assessing baseline hormone concentrations, whilst plasma sampling may best define immediate responses to environmental events. Consequently, future studies should ensure that they select the most appropriate matrix and method of hormone measurement to answer their research questions.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

But the vocalizations are not the only sources of information. Aspects of each species vocal behaviors are likely to be communicatively rich as well. During vocal interactions, for example, the latency delay between the calls could communicate an important message to the signal receiver, such as an interest and willingness to socialize. Here we employed novel, interactive playback software to address this issue in the antiphonal calling behavior of common marmosets. In these experiments, we parametrically varied the latency delay of antiphonal call stimuli and measured its effects on subjects’ resultant vocal behavior. Results showed that marmosets produced successively fewer antiphonal call responses during test conditions with increasing latency delays. Moreover, although subjects produced significantly more antiphonal than spontaneous calls in conditions with antiphonal call timing delays up to 9 s, a longer delay resulted in a significant decline in calling. These data suggest that antiphonal call timing is a salient cue for maintaining antiphonal calling interactions and may be used by marmosets to determine whether a subsequent call is produced in response to or independently of their own.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Seemingly exclusive to heterothermic fishes is a markedly reduced temperature dependence of blood–oxygen (blood–O2) binding, or even a reversed temperature dependence where increasing temperature increases blood–O2 affinity. These unusual binding properties have been documented in whole blood and in haemoglobin (Hb) solutions, and they are hypothesised to prevent oxygen loss from arteries to veins within the vascular heat exchangers and/or to prevent excessive oxygen unloading to the warm tissues and ensure an adequate supply of oxygen to tissues positioned efferent to the heat exchangers. The temperature sensitivity of blood–O2 binding has not been characterised in an ectothermic scombrid (mackerels and bonitos), but the existence of the unusual binding properties in these fishes would have clear implications for their proposed association with regional heterothermy. Accordingly, the present study examined oxygenation of whole blood of the chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) at 10, 20 and 30°C and at 0.5, 1 and 2% CO2. Oxygen affinity was generally highest at 20°C for all levels of CO2. Temperature-independent binding was observed at low (0.5%) CO2, where the PO2 at 50% blood–O2 saturation (P50) was not statistically different at 10 and 30°C (2.58 vs. 2.78 kPa, respectively) with an apparent heat of oxygenation (∆H°) close to zero (−6 kJ mol−1). The most significant temperature-mediated difference occurred at high (2%) CO2, where the P50 at 10°C was twofold higher than that at 20°C with a corresponding ∆H° of +43 kJ mol−1. These results provide clear evidence of independent and reversed open-system temperature effects on blood oxygenation in S. japonicus, and it is therefore speculated that these unusual blood–O2 binding characteristics may have preceded the evolution of vascular heat exchangers and regional heterothermy in fishes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although pineal glands are present in the majority of vertebrate species, a discrete organ is reported to be absent in the Crocodilia. However, if the melatonin rhythm is crucial to the survival of the organism, it would be expected that the rhythm would be present in crocodiles. In the present study, we measured blood plasma melatonin over a 30-h period in aestivating Australian freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) in their natural habitat at the end of the dry season (November) and found no discernible melatonin rhythm. However, another group of captive-reared C. johnstoni, maintained under natural light and temperature cycles and sampled in the early dry season (June) showed a clear melatonin rhythm. These results suggest that there is either an extrapineal source of melatonin in this crocodile species or that there is melatonin producing tissue elsewhere which heretofore has not been discovered.

So far, there are no data reporting possible regulation of any MCT isoform in the adrenal gland. Pectin is a soluble dietary fiber that is known to exert a hypocholesterolemic effect and increases the short chain fatty acids production in the large intestine. This work aimed to study the effect of pectin feeding on the expression of MCTs (MCT1–MCT5, MCT7, and MCT8) and their cellular distribution in rat adrenal gland. Western blotting demonstrated significant increase in the expression levels of MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, MCT5, and MCT7 in pectin-fed rats in comparison with the controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed extended distribution and distinctive increase in the immunoreactivities of MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, MCT5, and MCT7 in the adrenal cortical zones, besides the increase in the immunoreactive intensity of MCT5 and MCT7 in the adrenal medulla of pectin-fed versus control rats. Interestingly, zona glomerulosa which did not show any reactivity for MCT1 or MCT2 in controls, exhibited marked immunopositivities for both MCT1 and MCT2 in pectin-fed rats. MCT3 and MCT8, however, did not show significant changes in their expression levels between pectin-fed and control rats. Our data is the first to describe the up regulation of various MCTs in rat adrenal gland under the influence of pectin feeding. This up regulation might be a compensatory response to the hypocholesterolemic effect of pectin in order to maximize the intracellular availability of acetate.

Usually hive tasks require little or no flying, whereas foraging involves flying for several hours a day and carrying heavy loads of nectar and pollen. Flight muscles are particularly plastic organs that can respond to use and disuse, and accordingly it would be expected that adjustments in flight muscle metabolism occur throughout a bee’s life. We thus investigated changes in lifetime flight metabolic rate and flight muscle biochemistry of differently aged hive bees and of foragers with varying foraging experience. Rapid increases in flight metabolic rates early in life coincided with a switch in troponin T isoforms and increases in flight muscle maximal activities (Vmax) of the enzymes citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. However, further increases in flight metabolic rate in experienced foragers occurred without additional changes in the in vitro Vmax of these flight muscle metabolic enzymes. Estimates of in vivo flux (v) compared to maximum flux of each enzyme in vitro (fractional velocity, v/Vmax) suggest that most enzymes operate at a higher fraction of Vmax in mature foragers compared to young hive bees. Our results indicate that honeybees develop most of their flight muscle metabolic machinery early in life. Any further increases in flight metabolism with age or foraging experience are most likely achieved by operating metabolic enzymes closer to their maximal flux capacity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Before their utilization carotenoids must be acquired through diet and mobilized for specific uses. The relationships between carotenoid-based coloration, circulating carotenoids and body condition have been well studied in adult birds, but little is known in nestlings. Here, we investigated variations in carotenoid-based coloration in a raptor nestling, the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus), both in captivity and in natural conditions, and within a vole (poor-carotenoid source and cyclic prey) specialist population. We studied these variations according to nestling age and sex, and possible limitations in carotenoid availability by comparing years of contrasted prey abundance and using carotenoid supplementation experiments. Captive nestlings, fed only with mice, were strongly carotenoid limited. Wild nestlings were also carotenoid limited, especially in a year of high vole abundance. Nestlings were in better condition but less colored during a peak vole abundance year than during a low vole abundance year, when harriers targeted more alternative preys (birds, insects). Thus, variation in vole abundance resulted in a de-coupling of body condition and carotenoid-based coloration in this population. This suggested that the positive relation between the body condition and carotenoid-based traits, typically found in adult birds, could be restricted to adults or nestlings of species that feed on carotenoid-rich food. Our results should stimulate more work on the functions and mechanisms of carotenoid-based traits in nestlings, which deserve more attention and most likely differ from those of adult birds.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False
