The premise behind the RLT is that a user's lower limb is constrained into a physiologically normal gait pattern, ideally generating symmetry across gait cycle parameters and kinematics. This pilot study investigated adaptations in the natural gait pattern of healthy adults when using the RLT compared to normal overground walking. Bilateral lower limb kinematic and electromyography data were collected while participants walked overground at a self-selected speed, followed by walking in the RLT. A series of 2-way analyses of variance examined between-limb and between-condition differences. Peak hip extension and knee flexion were reduced bilaterally when walking in the RLT. Left peak hip extension occurred earlier in the gait cycle when using the RLT, but later for the right limb. Peak hip flexion was significantly increased and occurred earlier for the constrained limb, while peak plantarflexion was significantly reduced. Peak knee flexion and plantarflexion in the right limb occurred later when using the RLT. Significant bilateral reductions in peak electromyography amplitude were evident when walking in the RLT, along with a significant shift in when peak muscle activity was occurring. These findings suggest that the RLT does impose a significant constraint, but generates asymmetries in lower limb kinematics and muscle activity patterns. The large interindividual variation suggests users may utilize differing motor strategies to adapt their gait pattern to the imposed constraint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

ACL reconstruction surgery neither necessarily ensures return to pre-injury activities nor alleviates risk of long-term degeneration. Here in this computational investigation of a lower-extremity hybrid model at heel strike (HS) of gait, we search for factors that influence the stability of the joint and hence the distinct performances between post-ACL injury copers and non-copers. Due to the very unstable state of the joint under the mean gait input data, joint rotations-moments, posterior tibial slope (PTS), and cocontraction were altered within the reported data in the literature and the effects on the joint stability (anterior tibial translation (ATT) and critical muscle stiffness coefficient (qcr)) were investigated. Results indicate that, in presence of both a small extension moment (0.1 or 0.2 Nm/kg) and a flexion rotation (∼5-8°), ACL-deficient (ACL-D) knee joint stability substantially improves to levels computed in the pre-injury intact joint. In addition, low cocontraction levels of 1-3% (in hamstrings and quads only and not in gastrocnemii) and reduced PTS (by 5°) further improve ACL-D joint stability. Therefore for a stable joint with ATT < 3 mm and qcr < 25 similar to those in the intact knee at HS, higher flexion angles (>5°) and a small extension moment (∼0.1-0.2 Nm/kg) (i.e., higher activity in hamstrings than quads) are required. A lower posterior tibial slope (by 5°) and a small minimum cocontraction level (1-3%) in hamstrings and quads (but not in gastrocnemii) are also beneficial. These results identify mechanisms likely in play at HS in gait of copers when compared to non-copers.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For the validation of numerical models of the thoracic spine, however, the coupled motions within the single spinal segments are of importance to achieve high model accuracy. In the present study, eight fresh frozen human thoracic spinal specimens (C7-L1, mean age 54 ± 6 years) including the intact rib cage were loaded with pure bending moments of 5 Nm in flexion/extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR) with and without a follower load of 400 N. During loading, the relative motions of each vertebra were monitored. Follower load decreased the overall ROM (T1-T12) significantly (p < 0.01) in all primary motion directions (extension: -46%, left LB: -72%, right LB: -72%, left AR: -26%, right AR: -26%) except flexion (-36%). Substantial coupled motion was found in lateral bending with ipsilateral axial rotation, which increased after a follower load was applied, leading to a dominant axial rotation during primary lateral bending, while all other coupled motions in the different motion directions were reduced under follower load. On the monosegmental level, the follower load especially reduced the ROM of the upper thoracic spine from T1-T2 to T4-T5 in all motion directions and the ROM of the lower thoracic spine from T9-T10 to T11-T12 in primary lateral bending. The facet joints, intervertebral disc morphologies, and the sagittal curvature presumably affect the thoracic spinal coupled motions depending on axial compressive preloading. Using these results, the validation of numerical models can be performed more accurately.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, little is known about how the brain mechanically responds to fluid impacts and how the mechanical pressures/strains of the brain correlate to subsequent brain damage for rodents during FPI. Hence, we developed a numerical approach to simulate FPI experiments on rats and characterize rat brain pressure/strain responses at a high resolution. A previous rat brain model was improved with a new hexahedral elements-based skull model and a new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) layer. We validated the numerical model against experimentally measured pressures from FPI. Our results indicated that brain tissues under FPI experienced high pressures, which were slightly lower (10-20%) than input saline pressure. Interestingly, FPI was a mixed focus- and diffuse-type injury model with highest strains (12%) being concentrated in the ipsilateral cortex under the fluid-impact site and diffuse strains (5-10%) being spread to the entire brain, which was different from controlled cortical impact in which high strains decreased gradually away from the impact site.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, it still has not been performed in terms of favorable prediction accuracy and systematic experimental validation. In this study, we presented a methodology to develop a subject-specific FE-MS model of a human right lower extremity including the interactions among the subject-specific MS model, the knee joint model with ligament bundles, and the deformable FE prosthesis model. In order to evaluate its accuracy, the FE-MS model was compared with a traditional hinge-constraint MS model and experimentally verified over a gait cycle. Both models achieved good temporal agreement between the predicted muscle force and the electromyography results, though the magnitude on models is different. A higher predicted accuracy, quantified by the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r2), was found in the FE-MS model (RMSE = 177.2 N, r2 = 0.90) when compared with the MS model (RMSE = 224.1 N, r2 = 0.81) on the total tibiofemoral contact force. The contact mechanics, including the contact area, pressure, and stress were synchronously simulated, and the maximum contact pressure, 22.06 MPa, occurred on the medial side of the tibial insert without exceeding the yield strength of the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, 24.79 MPa. The approach outlines an accurate knee joint biomechanics analysis and provides an effective method of applying individualized prosthesis design and verification in TKR.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although current literature have proposed models to predict the recovery foot placement, swing leg actuation is rarely taken into account. In this paper, we combine the capturability-based analysis with swing leg dynamics and seek to contribute to the following problem: for a biped system recovering balance from external perturbations, how to choose a step position and duration in minimizing swing actuation cost? We expand the linear inverted pendulum model with an actuated linear pendulum mounted on the pelvis, the addition of which is proposed to describe the swing leg dynamics. The closed-form expression of swing actuation with constraints is derived from the explicit formulations of the pelvis and swing foot motion. We calculate the optimal step position and duration to minimize swing cost under various perturbations. Results show that the optimal step duration keeps constant, while the optimal step position is linearly proportional to the magnitude of perturbations. Such findings match well with experimental data from ten subjects delivered with waist-perturbations. These current results demonstrate that our proposed model with swing dynamics suggests an effective alternative to predict recovery foot placement of biped systems following unexpected perturbations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Creation of a dynamic model, however, is complicated by the actions of multi-articular tendons and their complex interactions with other soft tissues in the hand. This study explores the creation of a musculoskeletal model, including the thumb and index finger, to explore the effects of muscle activation deficits. The OpenSim model utilizes physiological axes of rotation at all joints, passive joint torques, and appropriate moment arms. The model was validated through comparison with kinematic and kinetic experimental data. Simulated fingertip forces resulting from modeled musculotendon loading largely fell within one standard deviation of experimental ranges for most index finger and thumb muscles, although agreement in the sagittal plane was generally better than for the coronal plane. Input of experimentally obtained electromyography data produced the expected simulated finger and thumb motion. Use of the model to predict the effects of activation deficits on pinch force production revealed that the intrinsic muscles, especially first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and adductor pollicis (ADP), had a substantial impact on the resulting fingertip force. Reducing FDI activation, such as might occur following stroke, altered fingertip force direction by up to 83° for production of a dorsal fingertip force; reducing ADP activation reduced force production in the thumb by up to 62%. This validated model can provide a means for evaluating clinical interventions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Relative motion between the tray and bone can be measured in vitro, but the full micromotion contour map cannot typically be accessed experimentally. Finite element models have been employed to estimate the full micromotion map, but have not been directly validated over a range of loading conditions. The goal of this study was to develop and validate computational models for the prediction of tray-bone micromotion under simulated activities of daily living. Gait, stair descent and deep knee bend were experimentally evaluated on four samples of a cementless tibial tray implanted into proximal tibial Sawbones™ constructs. Measurements of the relative motion between the tray and the anterior cortical shell were collected with digital image correlation and used to validate a finite element model that replicated the experiment. Additionally, a probabilistic analysis was performed to account for experimental uncertainty and determine model sensitivity to alignment and frictional parameters. The finite element models were able to distinguish between activities and capture the experimental trends. Best-matching simulations from the probabilistic analysis matched measured displacement with an average root mean square (RMS) difference of 14.3 µm and Pearson-product correlation of 0.93, while the mean model presented an average RMS difference of 27.1 µm and a correlation of 0.8. Maximum deviations from average experimental measurements were 40.5 and 87.1 µm for the best-matching and average simulations, respectively.

Implementing an energy based approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations of the lipid tubules are obtained. Moreover, the final governing equations are solved analytically to achieve the wave frequency and phase velocity of propagated waves.

In this study, we investigated the morphological and elastic properties of the human fascia lata taken from four (anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior) sites on the thigh of 17 legs of 12 cadavers (6 males and 6 females, 75-92 years). The thickness of the fascia lata was determined with a caliper. The interwoven collagen fiber's directions were measured and classified into longitudinal, transverse, and diagonal in two opposing directions, relative to the thigh. Tensile strength test along the longitudinal and transverse directions was performed, and the stiffness, Young's modulus, and hysteresis were determined. Fascia lata at the lateral site (0.8 ± 0.2 mm) was significantly thicker compared to other sites (0.2-0.3 mm). Fiber's directions showed substantial variability among sites, and longitudinally directed fibers were higher in proportion (28-32%) than those in other directions (20-27%) at all sites except for the posterior site. The stiffness and Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction (20-283 N/mm; 71.6-275.9 MPa, highest at the lateral site) were significantly higher than in the transverse direction (3-16 N/mm; 3.2-41.9 MPa, lowest at the lateral site). At the medial site, the proportion of the transversely directed fibers was higher in females than males, with higher stiffness and Young's modulus thereof.

The biomechanics of birth positioning are not yet fully understood; therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a computational model that could determine pelvic kinematics under loading conditions resulting from an upright birthing position. A three-dimensional model of the pelvic region was created from MRI scans of a non-pregnant subject. Bones were designated rigid segments with sacroiliac and pubic symphysis joint motion constrained only by contact surfaces and ligaments modeled as non-linear spring elements. Actuating torques at the lumbosacral and hip joints were defined based on motion analyses of squatting. The model was validated by comparing simulation results with data from the literature and in vivo MRI data from three subjects in a kneel-squat position. Good agreement was found between clinical pelvimetry measurements from the squat simulation and MRI data. Differences between simulation predictions were within one standard deviation of mean MRI kneel-squat results for all clinical measurements except one: the predicted increase in bispinous diameter was approximately 1.5 standard deviations less than that of the mean MRI results and still well within physiologic limits according to data in the literature. This model can, therefore, be used to provide further insight into the biomechanics of certain upright birthing positions, such as squatting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although men are also affected, women over 65 are 6 times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men of the same age. This is largely due to accelerated bone remodeling after menopause; however, the peak bone mass attained during young adulthood also plays an important role in osteoporosis risk. Multiple studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphisms in peak bone mass, and additionally, the female skeleton is significantly altered during pregnancy/lactation. Although clinical studies suggest that a reproductive history does not increase the risk of developing postmenopausal osteoporosis, reproduction has been shown to induce long-lasting alterations in maternal bone structure and mechanics, and the effects of pregnancy and lactation on maternal peak bone quality are not well understood. This study compared the structural and mechanical properties of male, virgin female, and post-reproductive female rat bone at multiple skeletal sites and at three different ages. We found that virgin females had a larger quantity of trabecular bone with greater trabecular number and more plate-like morphology, and, relative to their body weight, had a greater cortical bone size and greater bone strength than males. Post-reproductive females had altered trabecular microarchitecture relative to virgins, which was highly similar to that of male rats, and showed similar cortical bone size and bone mechanics to virgin females. This suggests that, to compensate for future reproductive bone losses, females may start off with more trabecular bone than is mechanically necessary, which may explain the paradox that reproduction induces long-lasting changes in maternal bone without increasing postmenopausal fracture risk.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims to evaluate the long bone fatigue damage using the ultrasonic guided waves. Two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method was employed to simulate the ultrasonic guided wave propagation in the long bone under different elastic modulus. The experiment was conducted on a 3.8 mm-thick bovine bone plate. The phase velocities of two fundamental guided modes, A1 and S1, were measured by using the axial transmission technique. Simulation shows that the phase velocities of guided modes A1 and S1 decrease with the increasing of the fatigue damage. After 20,000 cycles of fatigue loading on the bone plate, the average phase velocities of A1 and S1 modes were 6.6% and 5.3% respectively, lower than those of the intact bone.

In this study, we investigate the influence of the adhesion from the tongue on the soft palate global response. This is achieved using a cohesive zone finite element approach. A traction-separation law is determined to describe the adhesion effect from the surface tension of the lining liquid between the soft palate and the tongue. According to pull-off experimental tests of human lining liquid from the oral surface of the soft palate, the corresponding cohesive properties, including the critical normal traction stress and the failure separation displacement, are obtained. The 3D patient-specific soft palate geometry is accounted for, based on one specific patient's computed tomography (CT) images. The calculation results show that influence of the adhesion from the tongue surface on the global response of the soft palate depends on the length ratio between the cohesive length and the soft palate length. When the length of the cohesive zone is smaller than half of the soft palate length, the adhesion's influence is negligible. When the adhesion length is larger than 70 percent of soft palate length, the adhesion force contributes to preventing the soft palate from collapsing towards to the pharynx wall, i.e. the closing pressure is more negative than in the no adhesion case. These results may provide useful information to the clinical treatment of OSA patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Geometric measures often utilize magnetic resonance imaging, which can be costly and impractical for many investigations. Estimating moment arm from tendon excursion measured with ultrasonography may provide a cost-effective alternative to geometric measures of moment arm, but how well such measures represent geometry-based moment arms remains in question. The purpose of this study was to determine whether moment arms from tendon excursion can serve as a surrogate for moment arms measured geometrically. Magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging were performed on 19 young male subjects to quantify plantarflexor moment arm based on geometric and tendon excursion paradigms, respectively. These measurements were weakly correlated that approached statistical significance (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.052), and moment arm from tendon excursion under-approximated geometric moment arm by nearly 40% (p < 0.001). This weak correlation between methods is at odds with a prior report (N = 9) of a strong correlation (R2 = 0.94) in a similar study. Therefore, we performed 92,378 regression analyses (19 choose 9) to determine if such a strong correlation existed in our study population. We found that certain sub-populations of the current study generated similarly strong coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.92), but 84% of all analyses revealed no correlation (p > 0.05).

The 3CC muscle fatigue model uses differential equations to predict the flow of muscle between three muscle states: Resting (MR), Active (MA), and Fatigued (MF). This model uses a feedback controller to match the active state to target loads and two joint-specific parameters: F, fatigue rate controlling flow from active to fatigued compartments) and R, the recovery rate controlling flow from the fatigued to the resting compartments. This model does well to predict intensity-endurance time curves for sustained isometric tasks. However, previous studies find when rest intervals are present that the model over predicts fatigue. Intermittent rest periods would allow for the occurrence of subsequent reactive vasodilation and post-contraction hyperemia. We hypothesize a modified 3CC-r fatigue model will improve predictions of force decay during intermittent contractions with the addition of a rest recovery parameter, r, to augment recovery during rest intervals, representing muscle re-perfusion. A meta-analysis compiling intermittent fatigue data from 63 publications reporting decline in peak torque (% torque decline) were used for comparison. The original model over-predicted fatigue development from 19 to 29% torque decline; the addition of a rest multiplier significantly improved fatigue estimates to 6-10% torque decline. We conclude the addition of a rest multiplier to the three-compartment controller fatigue model provides a physiologically consistent modification for tasks involving rest intervals, resulting in improved estimates of muscle fatigue.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the upper limb, elbow flexor FS is greater in supinated and neutral forearm orientations compared to pronated, with contributions of tendon mechanics remaining unknown in position-dependent FS. This study investigated whether distal biceps brachii (BB) tendon mechanics across supinated, neutral and pronated forearm orientations influence position-dependent FS of the elbow flexors. Eleven males (23 ± 3 years) performed submaximal isometric elbow flexion tasks at low (5, 10% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)) and high (25, 50, 75% MVC) force levels in supinated, neutral and pronated forearm orientations. Distal BB tendon elongation and CSA were recorded on ultrasound to calculate mechanics of tendon stress, strain and stiffness. Relationships between FS, calculated as coefficient of variation (CV) of force, and tendon mechanics were evaluated with multiple regressions. Supinated and neutral were ∼50% stronger and ∼60% steadier than pronated (p < 0.05). Tendon stress was ∼52% greater in supinated and neutral compared to pronated, tendon strain was ∼36% greater in neutral than pronated (p < 0.05), while tendon stiffness (267.4 ± 78.9 N/mm) did not differ across orientations (p > 0.05). At low forces, CV of force was predicted by MVC (r2: 0.52) in supinated, and MVC and stress in neutral and pronated (r2: 0.65-0.81). At high force levels, CV of force was predicted by MVC and stress in supinated (r2: 0.49), and MVC in neutral (r2: 0.53).

To perform comparative analysis of the role of scavenger receptor CD36 on endothelial vs. sub-endothelial elastic modulus (stiffness) in the aortas of young and aged mice.


APPROACHES AND RESULTS
Elastic moduli of endothelial and sub-endothelial layers of freshly isolated mouse aortas were quantified using atomic force microscopy. In young mice (4-6 months old), we found that while endothelial stiffness is markedly reduced in aortas of CD36-/-mice, as compared to WT controls, no difference between CD36-/- and WT aortas is observed in the stiffness of the sub-endothelial layer in denuded arteries. Additionally, inhibition of myosin phosphorylation also decreases the elastic modulus in the EC, but not the sub-EC layer in WT mice. Moreover, inhibiting CD36 mediated uptake of oxLDL in intact WT aortas abrogated oxLDL-induced endothelial stiffening. Further analysis of aged mice (22-25 months) revealed that aging resulted not only in significant stiffening of the denuded arteries, as was previously known, but also a comparable increase in the elastic modulus of the endothelial layer. Most significantly, this stiffening in the EC layer is dependent on CD36, whereas the denuded layer is not affected.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that the role CD36 in stiffening of cellular components of intact aortas is endothelial-specific and that genetic deficiency of CD36 protects against endothelial stiffening in aged mice. Moreover, these data suggest that endothelial stiffness in intact mouse aortas depends more on the expression of CD36 than on the stiffness of the sub-endothelial layer.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, existing methods require kinematic and kinetic measurements of human body segments and can be complicated. This paper investigates the use of neural network model (NN) and accelerometer to estimate vertical ground reaction force (VGRF). An experimental study was conducted to collect sufficient samples for training, validation and testing. The estimated results were compared with VGRF measured using an instrumented treadmill. The estimates yielded an average root mean square error of less than 0.017 of the body weight (BW) and a cross-correlation coefficient greater than 0.99.

Highly skilled golf players (n = 10) performed golf swings with a 6-iron and a driver. Joint kinetics were calculated using ground reaction forces and segment kinematics to determine net joint moments (NJMs) during the interval of interest within the downswing. Between club difference in NJMs and 3D support moments were compared across the group and within a player. Although player-specific multi-joint control strategies arose, players generally increased target leg ankle, knee, and hip NJMs when hitting with the driver while maintaining the relative contribution to the 3D support moment. Multi-joint control strategies used to control the target and rear legs were found to be different, yet the majority of the 3D support moment was produced by NJMs about an axis perpendicular to the leg planes. These results emphasize the importance of recognizing how an individual player coordinates multi-joint control from each leg, and highlights the need to design interventions that are player and leg specific to aid in improving player performance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Moreover, the AT moment arm changes continuously during walking, as it depends on both ankle joint rotation and triceps surae muscle loading (presumably due to bulging of the muscle belly). Here, we posit that aging negatively effects the architecturally complex AT moment arm during walking, which thereby contributes to well-documented reductions in ankle moment generation during push-off. We used motion capture-guided ultrasound imaging to quantify instantaneous variations in the AT moment arms of young (23.9 ± 4.3 years) and older (69.9 ± 2.6 years) adults during walking, their dependence on triceps surae muscle loading, and their association with ankle moment generation during push-off. Older adults walked with 11% smaller AT moment arms and 11% smaller peak ankle moments during push-off than young adults. Moreover, as hypothesized, these unfavourable changes were significantly and positively correlated (r2 = 0.38, p < 0.01). More surprisingly, aging attenuated load-dependent increases in the AT moment arm (i.e., those between heel-strike and push-off at the same ankle angle); only young adults exhibited a significant increase in their AT moment arm due to triceps surae muscle-loading. Age-associated reductions in triceps surae volume or activation, and thus muscle bulging during force generation, may compromise the mechanical advantage of the AT during the critical push-off phase of walking in older adults. Thus, strategies to restore and/or improve locomotor performance in our aging population should consider these functionally important changes in musculoskeletal behavior.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of two clinically relevant, charged antibiotics, vancomycin (positively charged) and oxacillin (negatively charged) in IVD. A one-dimensional steady state diffusion experiment was employed to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of the two antibiotics in bovine coccygeal annulus fibrosus (AF) tissue. The averaged apparent diffusion coefficient for vancomycin under 20% compressive strain was 7.94 ± 2.00 × 10-12 m2/s (n = 10), while that of oxacillin was 2.26 ± 0.68 × 10-10 m2/s (n = 10). A student's t-test showed that the diffusivity of vancomycin was significantly lower than that of oxacillin. This finding may be attributed to two factors: solute size and possible binding effects. Vancomycin is approximately 3 times larger in molecular weight than oxacillin, meaning that steric hindrance likely plays a role in the slower transport. Reversible binding between positive vancomycin and the negative ECM could also slow down the rate of diffusion. Therefore, more investigation is necessary to determine the specific relationship between net charge on antibiotic and diffusion coefficients in IVD. This study provides essential quantitative information regarding the transport rates of antibiotics in the IVD, which is critical in using computational modeling to design effective strategies to treat disc infection.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Musculoskeletal modeling allows insight into the interaction of muscle force and knee joint kinematics that cannot be measured in the laboratory. However, musculoskeletal models of the lower extremity commonly use simplified representations of the knee that may limit analyses of the interaction between muscle forces and joint kinematics. The goal of this research was to demonstrate how muscle forces alter knee kinematics and consequently muscle moment arms and joint torque in a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb that includes a deformable representation of the knee.


METHODS
Two musculoskeletal models of the lower limb including specimen-specific articular geometries and ligament deformability at the knee were built in a finite element framework and calibrated to match mean isometric torque data collected from 12 healthy subjects. Muscle moment arms were compared between simulations of passive knee flexion and maximum isometric knee extension and flexion. In addition, isometric torque results were compared with predictions using simplified knee models in which the deformability of the knee was removed and the kinematics at the joint were prescribed for all degrees of freedom.


RESULTS
Peak isometric torque estimated with a deformable knee representation occurred between 45° and 60° in extension, and 45° in flexion. The maximum isometric flexion torques generated by the models with deformable ligaments were 14.6% and 17.9% larger than those generated by the models with prescribed kinematics; by contrast, the maximum isometric extension torques generated by the models were similar. The change in hamstrings moment arms during isometric flexion was greater than that of the quadriceps during isometric extension (a mean RMS difference of 9.8 mm compared to 2.9 mm, respectively).


DISCUSSION
The large changes in the moment arms of the hamstrings, when activated in a model with deformable ligaments, resulted in changes to flexion torque. When simulating human motion, the inclusion of a deformable joint in a multi-scale musculoskeletal finite element model of the lower limb may preserve the realistic interaction of muscle force with knee kinematics and torque.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite its widespread use, wear continue to be one of major factors implicated in revision surgery. Sliding distance, cross-shear, and contact stress are the major factors influencing polyethylene wear. As previous studies have either relied on wear simulations, computational modeling, or in vitro measurements to quantify sliding distance and cross-shear, in vivo subject-specific sliding distance and cross-shear after bi-cruciate retaining (BCR) TKA has not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to quantify the 6°-of-freedom (6DOF) in vivo kinematics, sliding distance, and cross-shear in BCR TKA patients during gait. Twenty-nine unilateral BCR TKA patients performed level walking on a treadmill under dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) surveillance. Cumulative normalized sliding distances between the lateral and medial compartments did not change significantly (p > 0.05) during the gait cycle. Although the total normalized sliding distance was similar between the lateral and medial compartments, the cross-shear at the lateral compartment differed significantly from that at the medial compartment (p < 0.001). Significant differences in the relative length positions of the peak sliding distance and cross-shear were found between the lateral and medial bearing components. The flexion-extension motion of the reconstructed knee was more associated with the linear displacements (anterior-posterior, R2 = 0.6; lateral-medial, R2 = 0.8, proximal-distal, R2 = 0.7) than the angular displacement (varus-valgus, R2 = 0.18; internal-external rotation, R2 = 0.28). Despite some differences in peak sliding distance and cross-shear positons, our results suggest similar articular contact patterns between the lateral and medial compartments in BCR TKA patients during gait. The data could provide insights into understanding the potential wear patterns in BCR TKAs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We developed a novel method using brace deflection to estimate the mechanical effect of valgus braces and validated this model using strain gauge instrumentation. Three subjects performed static and walking trials, in which the moment applied by an instrumented brace was calculated using the deflection and strain methods. The deflection method predicted average brace moments of 8.7 Nm across static trials; mean error between the deflection model predictions and the gold-standard strain gauge measurements was 0.32 Nm. Mean brace moment predictions throughout gait ranged from 7.1 to 8.7 Nm using the deflection model. Maximum differences (MAE) over the gait cycle in mean and peak brace moments between methods were 1.50 Nm (0.96) and 0.60 Nm (0.42). Our proposed method enables quantification of brace abduction moments without the use of custom instrumentation. While the deflection-based method is similar to that implemented by Schmalz et al. (2010), the proposed method isolates abduction deflection from the 3 DOF angular changes that occur within the brace. Though the model should be viewed with more caution during swing (MAE = 1.16 Nm), it was shown that the accuracy is influenced by the uncertainty in angle measurement due to cluster spacing. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the deflection-based method developed can predict comparable brace moments to those of the previously established strain method.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, it remains unclear if force-enhancing mechanisms can contribute to increased performance during in vivo stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) of human locomotor muscles. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether RFE-related mechanisms contribute to enhanced force and power output during SSCs of the human plantar flexor muscles. Net ankle torques of fourteen participants were measured during and after pure isometric, pure stretch, pure shortening, and SSC contractions when the triceps surae muscles were electrically stimulated at a submaximal level that resulted in 30% of their maximum isometric torque. Dynamic contractions were performed over an amplitude of 15°, from 5° plantar flexion to 10° dorsiflexion, at a speed of 120° s-1. External ankle work during shortening was 11.6% greater during SSCs compared to pure shortening contractions (p = .003). Additionally, RFD after SSCs (8.6%) was reduced compared to RFD after pure shortening contractions (12.0%; p < .05). It is therefore concluded that RFE-related mechanisms contribute to increased performance following SSCs of human locomotor muscles. Since RFD after SSCs decreased although work during shortening was increased, we speculate that the relevant mechanism lies outside actin-myosin interaction. Finally, our data suggests that RFE might be relevant and beneficial for human locomotion whenever a muscle is stretched, but this needs to be confirmed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Allograft tendons must be lyophilized for preservation before transplantation, a process which can impact mechanical properties of the graft. Reconstituted graft properties that are similar to native tendon are desirable. Although tensile and compressive properties of tendons have been investigated, there is a paucity of information describing flexural properties of tendon, which can impact the gliding resistance. This study aims to design a testing method to quantify tendon flexural modulus, and investigate the effects of lyophilization/rehydration procedures on tendon flexibility. A total of 20 peroneus longus tendons (extrasynovial) and 20 flexor digitorum profundus tendons (intrasynovial) were collected. Ten of each tendon were processed with 5 freeze-thaw cycles followed by lyophilization and rehydration with saline solution (0.9%). Bend testing was conducted on tendons to quantify the flexural modulus with and without processing. As canine FDP tendons contain fibrous and fibrocartilaginous tissue regions, the flexural moduli were measured in both regions. Flexural modulus of rehydrated, lyophilized extrasynovial PL tendon was significantly lower than that of similarly processed intrasynovial FDP tendon (p < 0.001). Flexural moduli of both the fibrocartilaginous and non-fibrocartilaginous regions of intrasynovial tendon significantly increased after lyophilization (p < 0.001). The flexural modulus of the fibrocartilaginous region was significantly higher than that of the non-fibrocartilaginous region in intrasynovial tendon (p < 0.001). Lyophilization significantly increases the flexural modulus of extrasynovial and intrasynovial tendons, and flexural modulus differs significantly between these two tendon types.

3D freehand ultrasound enables the creation of volumetric data. The acquisition of morphological features, such as muscle volume, is influenced by the variations in force applied to the skin with the ultrasound probe. To minimise the deformations, a concave-shaped plastic mount combined with a custom-shaped gel pad was developed for the ultrasound head, named Portico. This study analyses to what extent the Portico reduces muscle deformation and corresponding errors in estimating muscle volume.


METHOD
Twenty medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles were assessed (10 from typically developing children; 10 from children with spastic cerebral palsy). Two repetitions were acquired in each of the following approaches: (1) with the lower leg submerged in a water tank as a non-deformed reference; (2) probe-on-skin (PoS) as the conventional approach and (3) the newly introduced Portico. PoS and Portico data were registered with respect to the ones corresponding in a water tank. An in-house software package (Py3DFreeHandUS) was used to process the data and MG volume was estimated using MeVisLab. The minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated.


RESULTS
With respect to the PoS approach, the Portico reduced muscle deformation by 46%. For both the typically developing and spastic cerebral palsy cohorts, lower MDCs were found when using the Portico.


DISCUSSION
Despite the improvements, the Portico did not yield statistically more reliable MG volume estimations than the traditional PoS approach. Further improvement can be attained by optimising the fit between the gel pad and the curvature of the limb, using a larger choice of Portico geometries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims at validating an algorithm based on kinematic data to estimate the energy cost of running with frequent 180°-CoDs. Twenty-six physically active male subjects (22.4 ± 3.2 years) participated in two sessions: (1) maximum oxygen uptake (V̇O2,max) and maximal aerobic speed (MAS) test; (2) 5-m continuous shuttle run (two 5-min trials at 50% and 75% MAS, 6-min recovery). In (2), full-body 3D-kinematics and V̇O2 were simultaneously recorded. Actual cost of shuttle running (Cmeas) was obtained from the aerobic, anaerobic alactic and lactic components. The proposed algorithm detects ""braking phases"", periods of mostly negative (eccentric) work occurring at concurrent knee flexion and ground contact, and estimates energy cost (Cest) considering negative mechanical work in braking phases, and positive elsewhere. At the speed of, respectively, 1.54 ± 0.17 and 1.90 ± 0.15 m s-1 (rate of perceived exertion: 9.1 ± 1.8 and 15.8 ± 1.9), Cmeas was 8.06 ± 0.49 and 9.04 ± 0.73 J kg-1 m-1.

Application of FL was accomplished by loading the specimens with bilateral cables passing through cable guides inserted into the vertebral bodies and attached to load controlled linear actuators. FL significantly increased neutral zone (NZ) stiffness and NZ width but resulted in no change in the range of motion (ROM) or elastic zone stiffness. C45 and C56 IDP measured in the neutral position were significantly increased with application of FL. The change in IDP with increasing flexion rotation was not significantly affected by the application of FL, whereas the change in IDP with increasing extension rotation was significantly reduced by the application of FL. Application of FL did not appear to affect the specimen's quantity of motion (ROM) but did affect the quality (the shape of the curve). Regarding IDP, the effects of adding FL compression approximates the effect of the patient going from supine to a seated position (FL compression increased the IDP in the neutral position).

Here, we investigate the spinal kinematic constraint by analyzing the head instantaneous center of rotation (HICOR) with respect to the torso in head/neck sagittal extension and coronal lateral flexion during mild loads applied to 10 subjects. We found the mean HICOR location was near the C5-C6 intervertebral joint in sagittal extension, and T2-T3 intervertebral joint in coronal lateral flexion. Using the impulse-momentum relationship normalized by subject mass and neck length, we developed a non-dimensional analytical ratio between output angular velocity and input linear impulse as a function of HICOR location. The ratio was 0.65 and 0.50 in sagittal extension and coronal lateral flexion respectively, implying 30% greater angular velocities in sagittal extension given an equivalent impulse. Scaling to subject physiology also predicts larger required impulses given greater subject mass and neck length to achieve equivalent angular velocities, which was observed experimentally. Furthermore, the HICOR has greater motion in sagittal extension than coronal lateral flexion, suggesting the head and spine can be represented with a single inverted pendulum in coronal lateral flexion, but requires a more complex representation in sagittal extension. The upper cervical spine has substantial compliance in sagittal extension, and may be responsible for the complex motion and greater extension angular velocities.

Exercise training is a natural mode of mechanical loading to make bone more robust. Exercise-induced adaptation of cortical bone along the femoral neck has been previously demonstrated. However, it is unknown whether this adaption modulates hip fracture behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of specific exercise loading history on fall-induced hip fracture behavior by estimating fracture load and location with proximal femur finite element (FE) models created from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 111 women with distinct exercise histories: 91 athletes (aged 24.7 ± 6.1 years, >8 years competitive career) and 20 women as controls (aged 23.7 ± 3.8 years). The athletes were divided into five groups based on typical loading patterns of their sports: high-impact (H-I: 9 triple-jumpers and 10 high jumpers), odd-impact (O-I: 9 soccer and 10 squash players), high-magnitude (H-M: 17 power-lifters), repetitive-impact (R-I: 18 endurance runners), and repetitive non-impact (R-NI: 18 swimmers). Compared to the controls, the H-I, O-I, and R-I groups had significantly higher (11-26%, p < 0.05) fracture loads. Also, the fracture location in the H-I and O-I groups was significantly more proximal (7-10%) compared to the controls.

Hence, we propose a finite element (FE) based optimization method to obtain accurate bone material parameters from three-point bending test. We tested 80 machined bovine cortical bone specimens at both longitudinal and transverse directions using three-point bending. We then adopted the beam theory and the FE-based optimization method combined with specimen-specific FE models to derive the material parameters of cortical bone. We compared data obtained using these two methods and further evaluated two groups of parameters with three-point bending simulations. Our data indicated that the FE models with material properties from the FE-based optimization method showed best agreements with experimental data for the entire force-displacement responses, including the post-yield region. Using the beam theory, the yield stresses derived from 0.0058% strain offset for the longitudinal specimen and 0.0052% strain offset for the transverse specimen are closer to those derived from the FE-based optimization method, compared to yield stresses calculated without strain offset. In brief, we conclude that the optimization FE method is more appropriate than the traditional beam theory in identifying the material parameters of cortical bone for improving prediction accuracy in three-point bending mode.

The active drag in front-crawl swimming with and without leg motion was evaluated using measured values of residual thrust (MRT method) and compared with the passive drag of the streamlined position (SP) for the same swimmers. Seven male competitive swimmers participated in this study, and the testing was conducted in a swimming flume. Each swimmer performed front-crawl under two conditions: using arms and legs (whole stroke: WS) and using arms only (arms-only stroke: AS). Active drag and passive drag were measured at swimming velocities of 1.1 and 1.3 m s-1 using load cells connected to the swimmer via wires. We calculated a drag coefficient to compare the resistances of the WS, AS and SP at each velocity. For both the WS and AS at both swimming velocities, active drag coefficient was found to be about 1.6-1.9 times larger than that in passive conditions. In contrast, although leg movement did not cause a difference in drag coefficient for front-crawl swimming, there was a large effect size (d = 1.43) at 1.3 m s-1.

An advantage of this methodology is that it allows analysis of compartmental breathing volumes, thoraco-abdominal patterns, percentage contribution of each compartment and the coordination between compartments. In the literature, mainly, two marker models are reported, a full marker model of 89 markers placed on the trunk and a reduced marker model with 32 markers. However, in practice, positioning and post-process a large number of markers on the trunk can be time-consuming. In this study, the full marker model was compared against the one that uses a reduced number of markers, in order to evaluate (i) their capability to obtain respiratory parameters (breath-by-breath tidal volumes) and thoracoabdominal motion pattern (compartmental percentage contributions, and coordination between compartments) during quiet breathing, and (ii) their response in different groups such as trained and untrained, male and female. Although tests revealed strong correlations of the tidal volume values in all the groups (R2 > 0.93), the reduced model underestimated the trunk volume compared with the 89 marker model. The highest underestimation was found in trained males (bias of 0.43 L). The three-way ANOVA test showed that the model did not influence the evaluation of compartmental contributions and the 32 marker model was adequate to distinguish thoracoabdominal breathing pattern in the studied groups. Our findings showed that the reduced marker model could be used to analyse the thoracoabdominal motion in both trained and untrained populations but performs poorly in estimating tidal volume.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The first step in the development of atherosclerosis involves leukocyte adhesion to the arterial endothelium. It is broadly accepted that blood flow, more specifically wall shear stress (WSS), plays an important role in leukocyte capture and subsequent development of an atherosclerotic plaque. What is less known is how instantaneous WSS, which can vary by up to 5 Pa over one cardiac cycle, influences leukocyte capture. In this paper we use direct numerical simulations (DNS), performed using an in-house code, to illustrate that leukocyte capture is different whether as a function of instantaneous or time-averaged blood flow. Specifically, a stenotic plaque is modeled using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver through fully three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the immersed boundary method. Pulsatile triphasic inflow is used to simulate the cardiac cycle. The CFD is coupled with an agent-based leukocyte capture model to assess the impact of instantaneous hemodynamics on stenosis growth. The computed wall shear stress agrees well with the results obtained with a commercial software, as well as with theoretical results in the healthy region of the artery. The analysis emphasizes the importance of the instantaneous flow conditions in evaluating the leukocyte rate of capture. That is, the capture rate computed from mean flow field is generally underpredicted compared to the actual rate of capture. Thus, in order to obtain a reliable estimate, the flow unsteadiness during a cardiac cycle should be taken into account.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

How humans regulate this variability from stride-to-stride can be critical to maintaining balance. One cannot infer what is ""controlled"" based on analyses of variability alone. Assessing control requires quantifying how deviations are corrected across consecutive movements. Here, we assessed walking and running, each at two speeds. We hypothesized differences in speed would drive changes in variability, while adopting different gaits would drive changes in how people regulated stepping. Ten healthy adults walked/ran on a treadmill under four conditions: walk or run at comfortable speed, and walk or run at their predicted walk-to-run transition speed. Time series of relevant stride parameters were analyzed to quantify variability and stride-to-stride error-correction dynamics within a Goal-Equivalent Manifold (GEM) framework. In all conditions, participants' stride-to-stride control respected a constant-speed GEM strategy. At each consecutively faster speed, variability tangent to the GEM increased (p ≤ 0.031), while variability perpendicular to the GEM decreased (p ≤ 0.044). There were no differences (p ≥ 0.999) between gaits at the transition speed. Differences in speed determined how stepping variability was structured, independent of gait, confirming our first hypothesis. For running versus walking, measures of GEM-relevant statistical persistence were significantly less (p ≤ 0.004), but showed minimal-to-no speed differences (0.069 ≤ p ≤ 0.718). When running, people corrected deviations both more quickly and more directly, each indicating tighter control. Thus, differences in gait determined how stride-to-stride fluctuations were regulated, independent of speed, confirming our second hypothesis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the neuromuscular patterns associated with these walking styles are not well known, a factor that may influence knee joint load itself. Our aim was to conduct a thorough examination of the neuromuscular patterns associated with toe-in and toe-out walking in people with knee osteoarthritis. Fifteen participants were instructed to walk in four different foot rotations: 10° toe-in, 0°, as well as 10° and 20° toe-out. Nine surface electrodes were placed over lower extremity muscles and a variety of muscle activation parameters were examined. Peak and average medial hamstrings muscle activation was increased (p = 0.001, p < 0.001) during toe-in walking compared to toe-out walking. As well, average lateral gastrocnemius muscle activation was higher (p = 0.001) during toe-in walking compared to 20° toe-out. Medial thigh muscle co-contraction was higher (p = 0.003) during toe-in walking compared to all other conditions, and medial to lateral gastrocnemius activation ratio was lower (p = 0.032) during toe-in walking.

It is important significance to investigate the biomechanical behavior of the medial, middle and lateral PF regions. To investigate the non-uniform macro/micro structures of the different PF regions, the uniaxial tensile test of PF strips were performed to assess the mechanical behavior of PF. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to visualize and measure the micro morphology of PF associated with collagen fibers. A three-dimensional foot finite element (FE) model was developed to quantify the tensile behavior of the internal PF. The elastic modulus of the lateral PF component (1560 MPa) was observed, followed by the medial (701 MPa), the central (1100 MPa) and the lateral (714 MPa) portions in the central component. Elongation of the central portion (0.192) was lower than the medial (0.223) and the lateral (0.227) portions. The corresponding SEM images showed that the fibers of the central portion were more densely packed and thicker compared to the ambilateral portions in the central component. While the FE model prediction also suggested that the greater elastic modulus of the central PF portion had lower strain (0.192) versus the ambilateral portions. Therefore, the lower elongation and greater elastic modulus at the central portion of PF would probably have a high risk of PF injury. The findings showed a relation between the mechanical tension and fibrous morphology of PF.

The implementation of ADLs varies between studies; whilst some make use of props and define a functional target, others use simplified tasks to simulate the movements in ADLs. Simulated tasks have been used as an attempt to reduce the large movement variability associated with the upper limb. However, it is not known whether simulated tasks replicate the movements required to complete ADLs or reduce movement variability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of simulated tasks in upper limb assessments in comparison to functional movements. Therefore answering the following questions: Do simulated tasks replicate the movements required of the upper limb to perform functional activities? Do simulated tasks reduce intra- and inter-subject movement variability? Fourteen participants were asked to perform five functional tasks (eat, wash, retrieve from shelf, comb and perineal care) using two approaches: a functional and a simulated approach. Joint rotations were measured using an optoelectronic system. Differences in movement and movement variability between functional and simulated tasks were evaluated for the thorax, shoulder, elbow/forearm and wrist rotations. Simulated tasks did not accurately replicate the movements required for ADLs and there were minimal differences in movement variability between the two approaches.

Joint surface interaction is characterized by joint contact mechanics and by relative joint surface position potentially characterized by distance mapping. While ankle contact mechanics was investigated, limited information is available on joint distance mapping and its changes during motion. The purpose of this study was to use image-based distance mapping to quantify this interaction at the ankle and subtalar joints during tri-planar rotations of the ankle complex. Five cadaveric legs were scanned using Computed Tomography and the images were processed to produce 3D bone models of the tibia, fibula, talus and calcaneus. Each leg was tested on a special linkage through which the ankle complex was loaded in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, inversion/eversion, and internal/external rotation and the resulting bone movements were recorded. Fiduciary bone markers data and 3D bone models were combined to generate color-coded distance maps for the ankle and subtalar joints. The results were processed focusing on the changes in surface-to-surface distance maps between the extremes of the range of motion and neutral. The results provided detailed insight into the three-dimensional highly coupled nature of these joints showing significant and unique changes in distance mapping from neutral to extremes of the range of motion.

Studies have shown that motor variability of individual joints increases when performing upper limb tasks to fatigue, while movement parameters related to the task goal remain constant. However, how the inter-limb coordination and its variability change during specific movement phases with fatigue is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of neck-shoulder fatigue on shoulder and elbow kinematic variabilities, shoulder-elbow coordination and its variability, and endpoint characteristics during different phases of a forward pointing movement. Nineteen healthy young adults continuously performed a repetitive pointing task until fatigue (Borg rating of 8/10). Changes in elbow-shoulder coordination through the movement were assessed using the continuous relative phase and statistical nonparametric mapping methods. At the end of the task, muscle fatigue was evidenced by significant increases in anterior deltoid (+13%) and biceps brachii (+30%) activity. Shoulder horizontal abduction, elbow flexion variability and shoulder-elbow coordination variability were increased with fatigue at different moments of the movement cycle (shoulder: during the first 17% and most of the second half movement, elbow: from 73% to 91%, coordination: almost the whole movement). However, movement timing errors and endpoint spatial variability were mostly preserved, even with fatigue. We showed that increased variability with fatigue is not only observed in the fatigued joint (shoulder), but also in the elbow and shoulder-elbow coordination, and may have a goal of preserving global task performance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Intramuscular pressure (IMP) is the fluid pressure generated within skeletal muscle and directly reflects individual muscle tension. The purpose of this study was to assess the development of force, IMP, and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle during ramped isometric contractions and evaluate electromechanical delay (EMD).


METHODS
Force, EMG, and IMP were simultaneously measured during ramped isometric contractions in eight young, healthy human subjects. The EMD between the onset of force and EMG activity (Δt-EMG force) and the onset of IMP and EMG activity (Δt EMG-IMP) were calculated.


RESULTS
A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between the mean force-EMG EMD (36 ± 31 ms) and the mean IMP-EMG EMD (3 ± 21 ms).

This dilation results from vessel weakening owing to remodeling, i.e. due to cystic degeneration of the Tunica media (Marfan), progression of atherosclerosis or presence of a bicuspid aortic valve. The growth rate of the aortic diameter varies from patient to patient and may progress until the aneurysm ultimately ruptures. The role of hemodynamics, i.e. blood flow patterns, and shear stresses that are supposed to intensify during aneurysm growth are not yet fully understood, but thought to play a key role in the enlargement process. The aim of this study is to characterize the aortic blood flow in a silicone model of a pathological aorta with ascending aneurysm, to analyze the differences in the blood flow pattern compared to a healthy aortic model, and to single out possible blood flow characteristics measurable using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could serve as indicators for aneurysm severity. MRI simulations were performed under physiological, pulsatile flow conditions using data obtained from optical three dimensional particle tracking measurements. In comparison to the healthy geometry, elevated turbulence intensity and pressure loss are measured in the diseased aorta, which we propose as a complimentary indicator for assessing the aneurysmal severity. Our results shed a light on the interplay between the blood flow dynamics and their contribution to the pathophysiology and possible role for future risk assessment of ascending aortic aneurysms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Proper regulation of whole-body angular momentum is necessary to prevent falls, particularly in the frontal plane where individuals are most unstable. However, the balance recovery mechanisms used by lower-limb amputees when recovering from a perturbation are not well-understood. This study sought to understand the balance recovery mechanisms used by lower-limb amputees in response to mediolateral foot perturbations by examining changes to frontal plane whole-body angular momentum and hip joint work. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of frontal plane dynamic balance and associated joint contributions required to maintain balance during gait. Nine amputees and 11 non-amputees participated in this study where an unexpected medial or lateral foot placement perturbation occurred immediately prior to heel strike on the residual, sound or non-amputee limbs. Lateral perturbations of all limbs resulted in a reduced range of whole-body angular momentum and increased positive frontal plane hip work in the first half of single limb support. Medial perturbations for all limbs resulted in increased range of whole-body angular momentum and decreased positive frontal plane hip work, also in the first half of single limb support. These results suggest that medial foot placement perturbations are particularly challenging and that hip strategies play an important role in balance recovery. Thus, rehabilitation interventions that focus on hip muscles that regulate mediolateral balance, particularly the hip abductors, and the use of prostheses with active ankle control, may reduce the risk of falls.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Runners may be able to decrease tibial stress fracture risk by adopting a running pattern that reduces biomechanical parameters associated with a history of tibial stress fracture. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that converting to a forefoot striking pattern or increasing cadence without focusing on changing foot strike type would reduce injury risk parameters in recreational runners. Running kinematics, ground reaction forces and tibial accelerations were recorded from seventeen healthy, habitual rearfoot striking runners while running in their natural running pattern and after two acute retraining conditions: (1) converting to forefoot striking without focusing on cadence and (2) increasing cadence without focusing on foot strike. We found that converting to forefoot striking decreased two risk factors for tibial stress fracture: average and peak loading rates. Increasing cadence decreased one risk factor: peak hip adduction angle. Our results demonstrate that acute adaptation to forefoot striking reduces different injury risk parameters than acute adaptation to increased cadence and suggest that both modifications may reduce the risk of tibial stress fractures.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is much less common to translate successful developments in human biomechanics and prosthetic research to veterinary medicine to treat animals with limb loss. Current standard of care in veterinary medicine is amputation of the whole limb if a distal segment cannot be salvaged. Bone-anchored transcutaneous prostheses, developed for people with limb loss, could be beneficial for veterinary practice. The aim of this study was to examined if and how cats utilize the limb with a bone-anchored passive transtibial prosthesis during level and slope walking. Four cats were implanted with a porous titanium implant into the right distal tibia. Ground reaction forces and full-body kinematics were recorded during level and slope (±50%) walking before and 4-6 months after implantation and prosthesis attachment. The duty factor of the prosthetic limb exceeded zero in all cats and slope conditions (p < 0.05) and was in the range of 45.0-60.6%. Thus, cats utilized the prosthetic leg for locomotion instead of walking on three legs. Ground reaction forces, power and work of the prosthetic limb were reduced compared to intact locomotion, whereas those of the contralateral hind- and forelimbs increased (p < 0.05). This asymmetry was likely caused by insufficient energy generation for propulsion by the prosthetic leg, as no signs of pain or discomfort were observed in the animals. We concluded that cats could utilize a unilateral bone-anchored transtibial prosthesis for quadrupedal level and slope locomotion.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this process, sensory-motor (SM) latencies and muscular deficits, even in healthy older adults, may cause falls. This condition is worse for people with chronic neuromuscular deficits (stroke survivors, patients with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease). One therapeutic approach is to recover or improve quiet UP by utilizing a balance board (BB) (a rotating surface with a tunable stiffness and time delay), where a patient attempts to maintain UP while task difficulty is manipulated. While BBs are commonly used, it is unclear how UP is maintained or how changes in system parameters such as SM latencies and BB time delay affect UP stability. To understand these questions, it is important that mathematical models be developed with enough degrees-of-freedom to capture the many responses evoked during the maintenance of UP on a BB. This paper presents an ankle-hip model of balance on a BB, which is used to study the combined effect of SM latencies and active muscular stiffness of the ankle and hip joints, and the BB stiffness and time delay on UP stability. The analysis predicts that people with proprioceptive, visual, vestibular loss, or increased SM latencies may show either leaning postures or larger body-sway. The results show that the BB time delay and the visual and vestibular feedback have the largest impact on UP stability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study focused on the development and evaluation of a mathematical model of the whole heart, including the effects of heart contractility varying with heart rate changes. This model was developed based on a paradigm and model presented by Ottesen and Densielsen, which was used to model ventricular contraction. A piece-wise function together with expressions for time-related parameters were constructed for modeling atrial contraction. Atrial and ventricular parts of the whole heart model were evaluated by comparing with models from literature, and then the whole heart model were assessed through coupling with a simple model of the systemic circulation system and the pulmonary circulation system. The results indicated that both atrial and ventricular parts of the whole heart model could reasonably reflect their contractility varying with heart rate changes, and the whole heart model could exhibit major features of human heart.

Four values of each index were computed for each trial using successively the four conditions as normative data repository. Mean values over all participants were statistically compared (paired t-tests, 95% confidence level). Indices values computed with normative at equivalent walking speed were not statistically different from reference values. Meanwhile, deviations appeared when the walking speed discrepancy between conditions and normative increased. These drifts related to walking speed mismatch have been quantified and fitting functions proposed. A correction was applied to indices. GGI was efficiently adjusted while GDI and GPS remain different from their reference values for C1 and C2. Gait indices must be interpreted cautiously in function of the normative data repository's walking speed used for computation. Furthermore, a coupled use of conventional and corrected gait indices could lead to a better comprehension of the contribution of impairments and walking speed on gait deviations and overall gait quality.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Epidemiological data indicate that thoracic-only side airbags (tSABs) are not as effective as laboratory testing has suggested, and one of the reasons for this may be the use of surrogate-specific injury assessment methods, which are not directly transferable between Anthropometric Test Devices (ATDs) and Post-Mortem Human Surrogates (PMHSs). This study examines the effect of the thorax deformation measurement location and method on the predicted performance of seatbelts and tSABs in a side impact using a Human Body Model (HBM). The HBM was integrated in a vehicle and subjected to a Moving Deformable Barrier (MDB) impact at 61 km/h, with four restraint configurations: belted and unbelted, with and without a tSAB. Occupant response was assessed through chest band (CB) deformation, and as a change in distance between markers on the ribs. Multiple measurement locations in the HBM enabled direct comparison between the methods. The CB method indicated a 35% increase of chest compression due to tSAB; the rib-deflection (RD) method was not sensitive to the tSAB. The RD method predicted a 20% reduction of chest compression due to the seatbelt, but the CB-measured change was negligible. This study highlights the importance of measurement method on the response outcome and demonstrates that different outcomes may be predicted using a HBM for the same impact scenario, depending on the measurement method.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

To assess longevity and mechanical strength of TAVs in comparison to surgical bioprosthetic valves, three-dimensional deformation analysis and strain measurement of the leaflets become an inevitable part of the evaluation. The goal of this study was to measure and compare leaflet displacement and strain of two commonly used TAVs in a side-by-side comparison with a commonly used SAV using a high-resolution digital image correlation (DIC) system. 26-mm Edwards SAPIEN 3, 26-mm Medtronic CoreValve, and 25-mm Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna surgical bioprosthesis were examined in a custom-made valve testing apparatus. A time-varying, spatially uniform pressure was applied to the leaflets at different loading rates. GOM ARAMIS® software was used to map leaflet displacement and strain fields during loading and unloading. High displacement regions were found to be at the leaflet belly region of the three bioprosthetic valves. In addition, the frame of the surgical bioprosthesis was found to be remarkably flexible, in contrary to CoreValve and SAPIEN 3 in which the stent was nearly rigid under a similar loading condition. The experimental DIC measurements can be used to characterize the anisotropic materiel behavior of the bioprosthetic heart valve leaflets and validate heart valve computational simulations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how gait speed influences the FVM when walking. Fourteen young healthy adults performed a series of overground walking trials at three different speeds: low, preferred and fast. FVM was measured during the stance phase of the dominant leg using a force platform embedded in a 10 m-long walkway. Transverse plane kinematic parameters of the foot and pelvis were measured using a motion capture system. Results showed a significant decrease in peak abduction FVM (i.e., resisting internal foot rotation) and an increase in peak adduction FVM (i.e., resisting external foot rotation), together with an increase in gait speed. Concomitantly, we observed a decrease in the foot progression angle and an increase in the peak pelvis rotation velocity in the transverse plane with an increase in gait speed. A significant positive correlation was found between the pelvis rotation velocity and the peak adduction moment, suggesting that pelvis rotation influences the magnitude of adduction FVM. Furthermore, we also found significant correlations between the peak adduction FVM and both the step length and frequency, indicating that the alterations in FVM may be ascribed to changes in these two key variables of gait speed. These speed-related changes in FVM should be considered when this parameter is used in gait assessment, particularly when used as an index for rehabilitation and injury prevention.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To counter-act its influence on the jump length, the International Ski Federation (FIS) has introduced a wind compensation approach. We applied three differently accurate computer models of the flight phase with wind (M1, M2, and M3) to study the jump length effects of various wind scenarios. The previously used model M1 is accurate for wind blowing in direction of the flight path, but inaccuracies are to be expected for wind directions deviating from the tangent to the flight path. M2 considers the change of airflow direction, but it does not consider the associated change in the angle of attack of the skis which additionally modifies drag and lift area time functions. M3 predicts the length effect for all wind directions within the plane of the flight trajectory without any mathematical simplification. Prediction errors of M3 are determined only by the quality of the input data: wind velocity, drag and lift area functions, take-off velocity, and weight. For comparing the three models, drag and lift area functions of an optimized reference jump were used. Results obtained with M2, which is much easier to handle than M3, did not deviate noticeably when compared to predictions of the reference model M3. Therefore, we suggest to use M2 in future applications. A comparison of M2 predictions with the FIS wind compensation system showed substantial discrepancies, for instance: in the first flight phase, tailwind can increase jump length, and headwind can decrease it; this is opposite of what had been anticipated before and is not considered in the current wind compensation system in ski jumping.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ensuring design performance of the implant requires in vitro testing of the implant. A considerable amount of time is required to produce components and evaluate them inside an experimental setting. Numerous adjustments in the design of an implant and testing each individual design can be time consuming and expensive. Our solution is to use the OpenSim simulation software to rapidly test multiple design configurations of implants. This study modeled a testing rig which characterized the motion and laxity of knee implants. Three different knee implant designs were used to test and validate the accuracy of the simulation: symmetrical, asymmetric, and anatomic. Kinematics were described as distances measured from the center of each femoral condyle to a plane intersecting the most posterior points of the tibial condyles between 0 and 135° of flexion with 15° increments. Excluding the initial flexion measurement (∼0°) results, the absolute differences between all experimental and simulation results (neutral path, anterior-posterior shear, internal-external torque) for the symmetric, asymmetric, and anatomical designs were 1.98 mm ± 1.15, 1.17 mm ± 0.89, and 1.24 mm ± 0.97, respectively. Considering all designs, the accuracy of the simulation across all tests was 1.46 mm ± 1.07.

A potential cause is that whilst the neck bends in the whiplash motion, the changes of spinal canal volume induce impulsive pressure transients in the venous blood outside the dura mater (DM) and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the DM. The fluids can dynamically interact with the DRG and DM, which are deformable. In this work, the interaction is investigated numerically using a strong-coupling partitioned method that synchronize the computations of the fluid and structure. It is found that the interaction includes two basic processes, i.e., the pulling and pressing processes. In the pulling process, the DRG is stretched towards the spinal canal, and the venous blood is driven into the canal via the foramen. This process results from negative pressure in the fluids. In contrast, the pressing process is caused by positive pressure that leads to compression of the DRG and the outflow of the venous blood from the canal. The largest pressure gradient is observed at the foramen, where the DRG is located at. The DRG is subject to prominent von Mises stress near its end, which is fixed without motions. The negative internal pressure is more efficient to deform the DRG than the positive internal pressure. This indicates that the most hazardous condition for the DRG is the pulling process.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Utilizing a finite element model of the shoulder constructed from a single subject, we have quantified skin stresses exerted by backpack straps and the strains at the subclavian artery (SCA). For this end, standard shape straps with stiffness of 0.5, 1.2, and 5 MPa, were compared to the effects of optimized straps; a double-layered (soft outer layer and reinforced internal supporting layer) and newly-designed anatomically-shaped strap. Compared to the standard 0.5 MPa strap, the 5 MPa strap resulted in 4-times lower SCA strains and 2-times lower Trapezius stresses. The double-layered strap resulted in 40% and 50% reduction in SCA strains and skin stresses, respectively, with respect to the softer strap. The newly-designed anatomical strap exerted 4-times lower SCA strains and 50% lower skin stresses compared to the standard strap. This demonstrates a substantial improvement to the load carriage ergonomics when using a composite anatomical strap.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While several studies describe kinematics of healthy and osteoarthritic knees using the accurate imaging and computer modelling now possible, no systematic review exists to synthesise these data.


METHOD
A systematic review extracted quantitative observational, quasi-experimental and experimental studies from PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science that examined motion of the bony or articular surfaces of the tibiofemoral joint during any functional activity. Studies using surface markers, animals, and in vitro studies were excluded.


RESULTS
352 studies were screened to include 23 studies. Dynamic kinematics were recorded for gait, step-up, kneeling, squat and lunge and quasi-static squat, knee flexion in side-lying or supine leg-press. Kinematics were described using a diverse range of measures including six degrees of freedom kinematics, contact patterns or the projection of the femoral condylar axis above the tibia. Meta-analysis of data was not possible since no three papers recorded the same activity with the same measures. Visual evaluation of data revealed that knees with osteoarthritis maintained a more adducted position and showed less posterior translation of the lateral femoral condylar axis than healthy knees. Variability in activities and in recording measures produced greater variation in kinematics, than did knee osteoarthritis.


CONCLUSION
Differences in kinematics between osteoarthritic and healthy knees were observed, however, these differences were more subtle than expected. The synthesis and progress of this research could be facilitated by a consensus on reference systems for axes and kinematic reporting.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study describes subject-specific computational modeling of flow-induced velopharyngeal narrowing in a female child with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with OSA and a non-OSA control. Anatomically accurate three-dimensional geometries of the upper airway and soft-palate were reconstructed for both subjects using magnetic resonance (MR) images. A fluid-structure interaction (FSI) shape registration analysis was performed using subject-specific values of flow rate to iteratively compute the biomechanical properties of the soft-palate. The optimized shear modulus for the control was 38 percent higher than the corresponding value for the OSA patient. The proposed computational FSI model was then employed for planning surgical treatment for the apneic subject. A virtual surgery comprising of a combined adenoidectomy, palatoplasty and genioglossus advancement was performed to estimate the resulting post-operative patterns of airflow and tissue displacement. Maximum flow velocity and velopharyngeal resistance decreased by 80 percent and 66 percent respectively following surgery. Post-operative flow-induced forces on the anterior and posterior faces of the soft-palate were equilibrated and the resulting magnitude of tissue displacement was 63 percent lower compared to the pre-operative case. Results from this pilot study indicate that FSI computational modeling can be employed to characterize the mechanical properties of pharyngeal tissue and evaluate the effectiveness of various upper airway surgeries prior to their application.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty-two healthy young adults (19-37 years old) were instructed to try not to step in response to 86 different force/time combinations of forward waist-pulls. The forces at which 50% of subjects stepped (F50) were identified for each tested perturbation durations. Results showed that F50 decreased hyperbolically when the perturbation's duration increased and converged toward a constant value (about 10%BW) for longer perturbations (over 1500 ms). The effect of perturbation duration was critical for the shortest perturbations (less than 1 s). In parallel, a simple function was proposed to estimate this stepping boundary. Considering the dynamics of a linear inverted pendulum + foot model and simple balance recovery reactions, we could express the maximum pulling force that can be withstood without stepping as a simple function of the perturbation duration. When used with values of the main model parameters determined experimentally, this function replicated adequately the experimental results. This study demonstrates for the first time that perturbation duration has a major influence on the outcomes of compliant perturbations such as force-controlled pulls. The stepping boundary corresponds to a constant perturbation force-duration product and is largely explained by only two parameters: the reaction time and the displacement of the center of pressure within the functional base of support. Future work should investigate pathological populations and additional parameters characterizing the perturbation time-profile such as the time derivative of the perturbation.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous work observed targeted training of TPC via isolated trunk control tasks may improve performance in other activities (e.g., walking). However, the nature of this relationship remains unknown. We therefore investigated the relationship between TPC, at both the global (i.e., response to finite perturbations) and local (i.e., resistance to continuous perturbations) levels, during walking and unstable sitting, both at varying levels of task demand. Thirteen individuals (11 Male, 2 Female) with no recent history (past 12 months) of illness, injury, or musculoskeletal disorders walked on a dual-belt treadmill at four speeds (-20%, -10%, +10%, and + 20% of self-selected walking speed) and completed an unstable sitting task at four levels of chair instability (100, 75, 60, and 45% of an individual's ""neutral"" stability as defined by the gravitational gradient). Three-dimensional trunk and pelvic kinematics were collected. Tri-planar Lyapunov exponents and sample entropy characterized local TPC. Global TPC was characterized by ranges of motion and, for seated trials, metrics derived from center-of-pressure time series (i.e., path length, 95% confidence ellipse area, mean velocity, and RMS position). No strong or significant correlations (-0.057 < ρ < 0.206) were observed between local TPC during walking and unstable sitting tasks. However, global TPC declined in both walking and unstable sitting as task demand increased, with a moderate inter-task relationship (0.336 < ρ < 0.544).

Large measurement errors occur, however, when the force plate is accelerated, or tilted relative to gravity. This prohibits the use of force plates in human perturbation studies with controlled surface movements, or in conditions where the foundation is moving or not sufficiently rigid. Here we present a linear model to predict the inertial and gravitational artifacts using accelerometer signals. The model is first calibrated with data collected from random movements of the unloaded system and then used to compensate for the errors in another trial. The method was tested experimentally on an instrumented force treadmill capable of dynamic mediolateral translation and sagittal pitch. The compensation was evaluated in five experimental conditions, including platform motions induced by actuators, by motor vibration, and by human ground reaction forces. In the test that included all sources of platform motion, the root-mean-square (RMS) errors were 39.0 N and 15.3 N m in force and moment, before compensation, and 1.6 N and 1.1 N m, after compensation.

It is important to understand both the scalp-skull and the scalp-helmet sliding in order to determine the head response due to an impact. However, experimental data on the sliding properties of the scalp is lacking. The aim of this work was to identify the sliding properties of the scalp using cadaver heads, in terms of scalp-skull and scalp-liner (internal liner of the helmet) friction and to compare these values with that of widely used artificial headforms (HIII and magnesium EN960). The effect of the hair, the direction of sliding, the speed of the test and the normal load were considered. The experiments revealed that the sliding behaviour of the scalp under impact loading is characterised by three main phases: (1) the low friction sliding of the scalp over the skull (scalp-skull friction), (2) the tensioning effect of the scalp and (3) the sliding of the liner fabric over the scalp (scalp-liner friction). Results showed that the scalp-skull coefficient of friction (COF) is very low (0.06 ± 0.048), whereas the scalp-liner COF is 0.29 ± 0.07. The scalp-liner COF is statistically different from the value of the HIII-liner (0.75 ± 0.06) and the magnesium EN960-liner (0.16 ± 0.026).

Physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy are thought to affect balance and injury risk, with increased numbers of falls being reported. A maternity support belt (MSB) has been suggested to stabilize the pelvis and to enhance balance. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of an MSB on postural stability in different trimesters of pregnancy.


METHODS
Postural stability was assessed in the first (T1, n = 30), second (T2, n = 30) and third trimester (T3, n = 30) of pregnancy and compared to non-pregnant controls (n = 30), using a portable force plate. Postural sway during quiescent standing with and without applying an MSB was characterized by analyzing path length, velocity, amplitudes and area. Subsequently, anterior and posterior limits of stability (LoS) were determined.


RESULTS
Postural sway during quiescent standing did not change with pregnancy. However, LoS performance was reduced already in T1, before body mass significantly increased. The MSB led to a small improvement in the LoS while slightly increasing postural sway in anterior-posterior direction and shifting the center of pressure posteriorly during quiescent standing.


CONCLUSION
While impairments in balance already occurred early in pregnancy before body mass significantly increased, they were subtle and only measurable in exacerbated conditions. This challenges the assumed necessity of balance enhancing interventions in pregnant women. Although the MSB significantly affected body posture, the magnitude of the LoS improvement using the MSB was very small. Thus, it remains debatable if the MSB is a meaningful tool to increase balance during pregnancy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Quantifying balance in a reliable and valid manner is essential to evaluating disease progression, aging complications, and injuries in clinical and research settings. Typically, researchers use force plates to track motion of the center of gravity during a variety of tasks. However, limiting factors such as cost, portability, and availability have hindered postural stability evaluation in these settings. This study compared the ""gold standard"" for assessing postural stability (i.e., the laboratory-grade force plate) to a more affordable and portable assessment tool (i.e., BTrackS balance plate) in healthy young adults. Correlations and Bland-Altman plots between the center of pressure outcome measures derived from these two instruments were produced. Based on the results of this study, the measures attained from the portable balance plate objectively quantified postural stability with high validity on both rigid and compliant surfaces, demonstrated by thirty-five out of thirty-eight observed postural stability metrics in both surface conditions with a correlation of 0.98 or greater. The low cost, portable system performed similarly to the lab-grade force plate indicating the potential for practitioners and researchers to use the BTrackS balance plate as an alternative to the more expensive force plate option for assessing postural stability, whether in the lab setting or in the field.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study was conducted to determine the finite helical axes parameters and the tibiofemoral translation vector in the knee joints of two surgically induced injury sheep models: anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament transection (ACL/MCL Tx) (n = 5) and lateral meniscectomy (n = 5). We hypothesized that morphological damage in the experimental joints would be correlated to alterations in these kinematic variables. There was no strong evidence that morphological damage to the joints 20 weeks post ACL/MCL transection or meniscectomy was correlated with alterations in the finite helical axes variables. Nevertheless, significant correlations were found between the morphological damage to the joints and the magnitude of the change in the translation vectors after ACL/MCL transection (significant correlations (p = 0.005) during stance and trends (p < 0.1) at all points analyzed during swing). It can be concluded that: (1) osteoarthritic-like morphological damage after ACL/MCL transection is more critically correlated to the absolute tibiofemoral translational change and (2) alterations in analyzed kinematic variables cannot solely define osteoarthritis risk after meniscal injuries. From a clinical perspective, our results suggest that the magnitude of the change in the translation vector, which is independent of the coordinate system and combines the effects of the three translational degrees of freedom, i.e. medial-lateral, anterior-posterior and inferior-superior, would be an osteoarthritis risk factor after ligament injury, and requires validation in humans.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, diagnosis of cervical-flexibility impairment requires physiological reference values, which vary widely among the population. Although there is a general understanding that the cervical range of motion (RoM) alters with age and sex, the consolidated details of these variations remain lacking. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the difference of cervical RoM in different age and sex populations. The quality-assessment tool for quantitative studies was applied to assess methodological quality. We identified 4,034 abstracts through a database search and 3 publications through a manual search. Thirty-four cross-sectional studies were selected for the systematic review and measuring technologies were identified. The difference in age descriptions was substantial and a strong discrepancy existed between the mobility measured by radiological and non-radiological devices. Therefore, only 11 non-radiological studies with similar age descriptions were selected for meta-analysis. Cervical RoMs varied considerably among the populations and generally decreased with age. However, this diminishment started earlier and ended later in males, and was not continuous across age in both sexes. Females normally displayed a greater RoM than males, except in lateral bending. In young subjects, the difference between males and females was not significant. For subjects in their 50s, males displayed a non-significantly greater RoM than females. The variability of cervical RoMs can be explained by different devices as well as age and sex. However, the age-dependent reduction is not continuous and differs between males and females. These findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of the incidence of age- and sex-dependent cervical disorders, and may have important implications for the long-term success of different clinical interventions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

An increased likelihood of developing obesity-related knee osteoarthritis may be associated with increased peak internal knee abduction moments (KAbM). Increases in step width (SW) may act to reduce this moment. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of increased SW on knee biomechanics during stair negotiation of healthy-weight and obese participants.


METHODS
Participants (24: 10 obese and 14 healthy-weight) used stairs and walked over level ground while walking at their preferred speed in two different SW conditions - preferred and wide (200% preferred). A 2 × 2 (group × condition) mixed model analysis of variance was performed to analyze differences between groups and conditions (p < 0.05).


RESULTS
Increased SW increased the loading-response peak knee extension moment during descent and level gait, decreased loading-response KAbMs, knee extension and abduction range of motion (ROM) during ascent, and knee adduction ROM during descent. Increased SW increased loading-response peak mediolateral ground reaction force (GRF), increased peak knee abduction angle during ascent, and decreased peak knee adduction angle during descent and level gait. Obese participants experienced disproportionate changes in loading-response mediolateral GRF, KAbM and peak adduction angle during level walking, and peak knee abduction angle and ROM during ascent.


CONCLUSION
Increased SW successfully decreased loading-response peak KAbM. Implications of this finding are that increased SW may decrease medial compartment knee joint loading, decreasing pain and reducing joint deterioration. Increased SW influenced obese and healthy-weight participants differently and should be investigated further.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The biceps brachii (BB: manipulated muscle) and the brachialis (BRA: resting adjacent muscle) were deemed suitable for this study because they are neighboring, yet have independent tendons that insert onto different bones. In order to manipulate the muscle length of BB only, the forearm was passively set at supination, neutral, and pronation positions. For thirteen healthy young adult men, the shear modulus of BB and BRA was measured with shear-wave elastography at proximal and distal muscle regions for each forearm position and with the elbow joint angle at either 100° or 160°. At both muscle regions and both elbow positions, BB shear modulus increased as the forearm was rotated from a supinated to pronated position. Conversely, BRA shear modulus decreased as function of forearm position. The effect of forearm position on shear modulus was most pronounced in the distal muscle region when the elbow was at 160°. The observed alteration of shear modulus of the resting adjacent muscle indicates that epimuscular myofascial force transmission is present in the human upper limb. Consistent with this assertion, we found that the effect of muscle length on shear modulus in both muscles was region-dependent. Our results also suggest that epimuscular myofascial force transmission may be facilitated at stretched muscle lengths.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Meanwhile, strain rates between 10 and 200/s have been observed in previous dynamic finite element models of the proximal femur loaded at realistic sideways fall speeds. This study aimed to quantify the effect of strain rate (ε̇) on modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate stress (σu), failure energy (Uf), and minimum stress (σm) of trabecular bone in order to improve the biofidelity of material properties used in dynamic simulations of sideways fall loading on the hip. Cylindrical cores of trabecular bone (D = 8 mm, Lgauge = 16 mm, n = 34) from bovine proximal tibiae and distal femurs were scanned in µCT (10 µm), quantifying apparent density (ρapp) and degree of anisotropy (DA), and subsequently impacted within a miniature drop tower. Force of impact was measured using a piezoelectric load cell (400 kHz), while displacement during compression was measured from high speed video (50,000 frames/s). Four groups, with similar density distributions, were loaded at different impact velocities (0.84, 1.33, 1.75, and 2.16 m/s) with constant kinetic energy (0.4 J) by adjusting the impact mass. The mean strain rates of each group were significantly different (p < 0.05) except for the two fastest impact speeds (p = 0.09). Non-linear regression models correlated strain rate, DA, and ρapp with ultimate stress (R2 = 0.76), elastic modulus (R2 = 0.63), failure energy (R2 = 0.38), and minimum stress (R2 = 0.57). These results indicate that previous estimates of σu could be under predicting the mechanical properties at strain rates above 10/s.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The device quantifies sample degradation by monitoring its deformation induced by a static gravity load. Initial instrument design and experimental protocol development focused on quantifying cartilage degeneration. Characterization of measurement errors, caused mainly by thermal transients and by translating the instrument sensor, demonstrated that HDD can quantify sample degradation with <6 μm precision and <10 μm temperature-induced errors. HDD capabilities were evaluated in a pilot study that monitored the degradation of fresh ex vivo human cartilage samples by collagenase solutions over three days. HDD could robustly resolve the effects of collagenase concentration as small as 0.5 mg/ml. Careful sample preparation resulted in measurements that did not suffer from donor-to-donor variation (coefficient of variance <70%). Due to its unique combination of sample throughput, measurement precision, temporal sampling and experimental versality, HDD provides a novel biomechanics-based experimental platform for quantifying the effects of proteins (cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, antibodies) or small molecules on the degradation of soft tissues or tissue engineering constructs. Thereby, HDD can complement established tools and in vitro models in important applications including drug screening and biomaterial development.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of plantarflexion resistance of an articulated AFO on ankle and knee joint power of the limb wearing the AFO in individuals post-stroke. Gait analysis was performed on 10 individuals with chronic stroke using a Vicon 3-dimensional motion capture system and a Bertec split-belt instrumented treadmill. They walked on the treadmill under 4 plantarflexion resistance levels (S1 < S2<S3 < S4) set on the AFO with resistance adjustable ankle joints. The ankle and knee joint power calculations were performed using Visual3D, and mean values were plotted across a gait cycle. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the peak ankle joint power generation according to the plantarflexion resistance of the AFO (P = 0.008). No significant differences were found in the knee joint power. Peak ankle joint power generation [Median (IQR: Interquartile range)] were S1: 0.0517 (0.0238-0.1071) W/kg, S2: 0.0342 (0.0132-0.0862) W/kg, S3: 0.0353 (0.0127-0.0821) W/kg, and S4: 0.0234 (0.0087-0.06764) W/kg. Reduction of the peak ankle joint power generation appeared to be related to reduction in the peak plantarflexion angular velocity at late stance due to increases in the plantarflexion resistance of the AFO. This study showed that peak ankle joint power generation was significantly, and somewhat systematically, affected by plantarflexion resistance of the AFO in individuals post-stroke.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

These values were then compared to the testing parameters recommended for measuring shoe-floor ACOF. Kinematic and kinetic data of thirty-nine subjects who experienced a slip incident were pooled from four similar human slipping studies for this secondary analysis. Vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), center of pressure (COP), shoe-floor angle, side-slip angle, sliding speed and contact time were quantified at slip start (SS) and at the time of peak sliding speed (PSS). Statistical comparisons were used to test if any discrepancies exist between the state of slipping foot and current ACOF testing parameters. The main findings were that the VGRF (26.7 %BW, 179.4 N), shoe-floor angle (22.1°) and contact time (0.02 s) at SS were significantly different from the recommended ACOF testing parameters. Instead, the testing parameters are mostly consistent with the state of the shoe at PSS.

The objective of this study was to characterize the local structural stiffness of the native aortic root, to create a baseline for understanding how different surgical interventions affect the dynamics of the aortic root. In this acute porcine study (N = 10), two dedicated force transducers were implanted to quantify the forces acting on both the annular plane and on the sinotubular junction (STJ). To assess the changes in geometry, eleven sonomicrometry crystals were implanted within the aortic root. The combination of force and length measurements yields the radial structural stiffness for each segment of the aortic root. The least compliant segment at the annular plane was the right-left interleaflet triangle with a stiffness modulus of 1.1 N mm-1 (SD0.4). At the sinotubular junction the same segment (right-left) was most compliant, compared with the two other segments, however not statistically significant different. The elastic energy storage was derived from the aortic root pressure volume relationship; the mean elastic energy storage was 826 µJ (SD529). In conclusion, the aortic root has been characterized in terms of both segmental forces, segmental change in length and elastic energy storage. This study is the first to assess the radial structural stiffness of different segments of the aortic root.

The aim of this study is to explain how severe tissue ingrowth and calcification (TIC) in a surgical aortic valve (SAV) can be one physical mechanism leading to anomalous ViV performance characteristic. The ViV hemodynamic performance was evaluated as a function of axial positioning -9.8, -6.2, 0, and +6 mm in SAVs with and without TIC. Effective orifice area (EOA) and PG were compared. Leaflet high-speed imaging and particle image velocimetry were performed to elucidate flutter and forward jet characteristics. ViV without TIC showed significantly lower PG and greater EOA (p < 0.01). EOA and PG improve with supra-annular deployment (p < 0.01) while for ViV with TIC, EOA and PG worsen as the deployment varies from -9.8 mm to 0 mm (p < 0.01) only to recover at + 6 mm (p < 0.01). Separated jet flow at the TIC site, and consequently induced stronger TAV leaflet fluttering highlight the dynamic compromising nature of TIC on jet width and performance reduction. We conclude that the inflow TIC greatly influence ViV performance due to dynamic effects that results in a real anomalous performance characteristic different than that seen in most ViV in vivo. Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate ViV outcomes in the presence of severe TIC in SAVs.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

An energy harvesting assault pack (EHAP) was developed to provide a power source to recharge batteries and reduce the quantity and load of extra batteries carried into the field. Little is known about the biomechanical implications of carrying a suspended-load energy harvesting system compared to the military standard assault pack (AP). Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the impact of pack type and load magnitude on spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters while walking at 1.34 m/s on an instrumented treadmill at decline, level, and incline grades. There was greater forward trunk lean while carrying the EHAP and the heavy load (decline: p < 0.001; level: p = 0.009; incline: p = 0.003). As load increased from light to heavy, double support stance time was longer (decline: p = 0.012; level: p < 0.001; incline: p < 0.001), strides were shorter (incline: p = 0.013), and knee flexion angle at heel strike was greater (decline: p = 0.033; level: p = 0.035; incline: p = 0.005). When carrying the EHAP, strides (decline: p = 0.007) and double support stance time (incline: p = 0.006) was longer, the knee was more flexed at heel strike (level: p = 0.014; incline: p < 0.001) and there was a smaller change in knee flexion during weight acceptance (decline: p = 0.0013; level: p = 0.007; incline: p = 0.0014).

To understand the biomechanical function of the ACL, previous studies have primarily reported the net change in tibial position in response to multiplanar torques, which generate knee instability. In contrast, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 13 consecutively tested cadaveric knees and found distinct motion patterns, defined as the motion of the tibia as it translates and rotates from its unloaded, initial position to its loaded, final position. Specifically, ACL-sectioned knees either subluxated anteriorly under valgus torque (VL-subluxating) (5 knees) or under a combination of valgus and internal rotational torques (VL/IR-subluxating) (8 knees), which were applied at 15 and 30° flexion using a robotic manipulator. The purpose of this study was to identify differences between these knees that could be driving the two distinct motion patterns. Therefore, we asked whether parameters of bony geometry and tibiofemoral laxity (known risk factors of non-contact ACL injury) as well as in situ ACL force, when it was intact, differentiate knees in these two groups. VL-subluxating knees exhibited greater sagittal slope of the lateral tibia by 3.6 ± 2.4° (p = 0.003); less change in anterior laxity after ACL-sectioning during a simulated Lachman test by 3.2 ± 3.2 mm (p = 0.006); and, at the peak applied valgus torque (no internal rotation torque), higher posteriorly directed, in situ ACL force by 13.4 ± 11.3 N and 12.0 ± 11.6 N at 15° and 30° of flexion, respectively (both p ≤ 0.03). These results may suggest that subgroups of knees depend more on their ACL to control lateral tibial subluxation in response to uniplanar valgus and multiplanar valgus and internal rotation torques as mediated by anterior laxity and bony morphology.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Sixteen healthy young and healthy older adults (eight men and eight women in each group) participated. Participants performed 90° step and spin turns to the right at a self-selected normal speed. Older adults turned with lower RCOF than the young adults during both step and spin turns. This was associated with reduced mediolateral (ML) RCOF component (RCOFML) for the older adults. Reduced RCOFML in older adults was associated with reductions in the ML component of the lean angle of the body during turning. This age-related gait changes during turning can be compensatory mechanisms that allowed older adults to turn while reducing the risk of slipping. Spin turns exhibited lower RCOF, resulting from significantly lower RCOFML, than step turns in young and older adults; thus, spin turning is a safer turning strategy for preventing lateral slips. This may suggest that, in older adults, slip prevention may take precedence over balance recovery after slips sustained during turning. These results illustrate a turning gait mechanism that helps prevent slips and falls, and how age affects this mechanism.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In order to determine shoulder kinematics during this movement, multibody kinematics optimization (MKO) can be recommended to limit the effect of the soft tissue artifact and to avoid joint dislocations or bone penetration in reconstructed kinematics. Classically, in golf biomechanics research, the shoulder is represented by a 3 degrees-of-freedom model representing the glenohumeral joint. More complex and physiological models are already provided in the scientific literature. Particularly, the model used in this study was a full body model and also described motions of clavicles and scapulae. This study aimed at quantifying the effect of utilizing a more complex and physiological shoulder model when studying the golf swing. Results obtained on 20 golfers showed that a more complex and physiologically-accurate model can more efficiently track experimental markers, which resulted in differences in joint kinematics. Hence, the model with 3 degrees-of-freedom between the humerus and the thorax may be inadequate when combined with MKO and a more physiological model would be beneficial.

Zoledronic acid is a long-lasting antiresorptive agent, which is known to reduce short-term periprosthetic bone loss. However, its effect on femoral stem stability is not well known. Forty-nine female patients with a mean age of 68 years (range, 51-85 years) scheduled to undergo cementless total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis were randomized in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to receive a single postoperative infusion of zoledronic acid or placebo. Patients were evaluated for up to four years postoperatively for femoral stem migration measured by radiostereometric analysis, bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, functional recovery, and patient-reported outcome scores. Implant survival was determined at nine years postoperatively. Zoledronic acid did not reduce the femoral stem migration that occurred predominantly during the settling period of the first 3-6 months. Subsequently, all femoral stems were radiographically osseointegrated. Zoledronic acid maintained periprosthetic BMD, while the expected loss of periprosthetic bone during the first 12 months was found in controls.

Commercially available rings vary in dimensions and material properties. Annuloplasty ring suture dehiscence from the native annulus is a catastrophic yet poorly understood phenomenon that has been reported across ring types. Recognizing that sutures typically dehisce from the structurally weaker posterior annulus, our group is conducting a multi-part study in search of ring design parameters that influence forces acting on posterior annular sutures in the beating heart. Herein, we report the effect of ring rigidity on suture forces. Measurements utilized custom force sensors, attached to annuloplasty rings and implanted in normal ovine subjects via standard surgical procedure. Tested rings included the semi-rigid Physio (Edwards Lifesciences) and rigid and flexible prototypes of matching geometry. While no significant differences due to ring stiffness existed for sutures in the anterior region, posterior forces were significantly reduced with use of the flexible ring (rigid: 1.95 ± 0.96 N, semi-rigid: 1.76 ± 1.19 N, flexible: 1.04 ± 0.63 N; p < 0.001). The ratio of anterior to posterior FC scaled positively with increasing flexibility (p < 0.001), and posterior forces took more time to reach their peak load when a flexible ring was used (p < 0.001). This suggests a more rigid ring enables more rapid/complete force equilibration around the suture network, transferring higher anterior forces to the weaker posterior tissue. For mitral annuloplasties requiring ring rigidity, we propose a ring design concept to potentially disrupt this force transfer and improve suture retention.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Finite element method had been used to investigate corrosion of MAS. However, related researches mostly described all elements suffered corrosion in view of one-dimensional corrosion. Multi-dimensional corrosions significantly influence mechanical integrity of MAS structures such as edges and corners. In this study, the effects of multi-dimensional corrosion were studied using experiment quantitatively, then a phenomenological corrosion model was developed to consider these effects. We implemented immersion test with magnesium alloy (AZ31B) cubes, which had different numbers of exposed surfaces to analyze differences of dimension. It was indicated that corrosion rates of cubes are almost proportional to their exposed-surface numbers, especially when pitting corrosions are not marked. The cubes also represented the hexahedron elements in simulation. In conclusion, corrosion rate of every element accelerates by increasing corrosion-surface numbers in multi-dimensional corrosion. The damage ratios among elements with the same size are proportional to the ratios of corrosion-surface numbers under uniform corrosion.

The objective of the study is to estimate active moments by muscles, passive moments by connective tissues and joint contact forces in the foot joints during walking. Joint kinematics and external forces of ten healthy subjects (all males, 24.7 ± 1.2 years) were acquired during walking. The data were entered into the five-segment musculoskeletal foot model to calculate muscle forces and joint contact forces of the foot joints using an inverse dynamics-based optimization. Joint reaction forces and active, passive and net moments of each joint were calculated from muscle and ligament forces. The maximum joint reaction forces were 8.72, 4.31, 2.65, and 3.41 body weight (BW) for the ankle, Chopart's, Lisfranc and metatarsophalangeal joints, respectively. Active and passive moments along with net moments were also obtained. The maximum net moments were 8.6, 8.4, 5.4 and 0.8%BW∙HT, respectively. While the trend of net moment was very similar between the four joints, the magnitudes and directions of the active and passive moments varied between joints. The active and passive moments during walking could reveal the roles of muscles and ligaments in each of the foot joints, which was not obvious in the net moment.

We find that the Lee-Sacks model is well-suited to reproduce the anisotropic stress-strain behavior of the cross-linked bovine pericardial tissues that are commonly used in BHVs. An automated procedure for parameter selection leads to an instance of the Lee-Sacks model that matches biaxial stress-strain data from the literature more closely, over a wider range of strains, than other soft tissue models.

Rate of torque development may provide further insight into the relationship between muscle function and gait following stroke. Aims of this study were to examine the test-retest reliability of hand-held dynamometry to measure isometric rate of torque development following stroke, to examine associations between strength and rate of torque development, and to compare the relationships of strength and rate of torque development to gait velocity. Sixty-three post-stroke adults participated (60 years, 34 male). Gait velocity was assessed using the fast-paced 10 m walk test. Isometric strength and rate of torque development of seven lower-limb muscle groups were assessed with hand-held dynamometry. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for reliability and Spearman's rho correlations were calculated for associations. Regression analyses using partial F-tests were used to compare strength and rate of torque development in their relationship with gait velocity. Good to excellent reliability was shown for strength and rate of torque development (0.82-0.97). Strong associations were found between strength and rate of torque development (0.71-0.94). Despite high correlations between strength and rate of torque development, rate of torque development failed to provide significant value to regression models that already contained strength. Assessment of isometric rate of torque development with hand-held dynamometry is reliable following stroke, however isometric strength demonstrated greater relationships with gait velocity.

Currently, the measurement of carpal tunnel pressure is invasive and therefore, a noninvasive technique is needed. We previously demonstrated that speed of wave propagation through a tendon in the carpal tunnel measured by ultrasound elastography could be used as an indicator of carpal tunnel pressure in a cadaveric model, in which a balloon had to be inserted into the carpal tunnel to adjust the carpal tunnel pressure. However, the method for adjusting the carpal tunnel pressure in the cadaveric model is not applicable for the in vivo model. The objective of this study was to utilize a different technique to adjust carpal tunnel pressure via pressing the palm and to validate it with ultrasound surface wave elastography in a human cadaveric model. The outcome was also compared with a previous balloon insertion technique. Results showed that wave speed of intra-carpal tunnel tendon and the ratio of wave speed of intra-and outer-carpal tunnel tendons increased linearly with carpal tunnel pressure. Moreover, wave speed of intra carpal tunnel tendon via both ways of altering carpal tunnel pressure showed similar results with high correlation. Therefore, it was concluded that the technique of pressing the palm can be used to adjust carpal tunnel pressure, and pressure changes can be detected via ultrasound surface wave elastography in an ex vivo model. Future studies will utilize this technique in vivo to validate the usefulness of ultrasound surface wave elastography for measuring carpal tunnel pressure.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this paper we provide the first quantification of the variation in in vivo viscoelastic properties of the intact distal birth canal in healthy nulliparous women using Fung's Quasilinear Viscoelastic Theory and a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of constant force birth canal dilation to 8 cm diameter in the first stage of labor in 26 nullipara. We hypothesized that no significant inter-individual variation would be found in the long time constant, τ2, which characterizes how long it takes the birth canal to be dilated by the fetal head. That hypothesis was rejected because τ2 values ranged 20-fold above and below the median value. These data were input to a biomechanical model to calculate how such variations affect the predicted length of the active second stage of labor as well as PVM tear risk. The results show there was a 100-fold change in the predicted length of active second stage for the shortest and longest τ2 values, with a noticeable increase for τ2 values over 1000 s. The correlation coefficent between predicted and observed second stage durations was 0.51. We conclude that τ2 is a strong theoretical contributor to the time a mother has to push in order to deliver a fetal head larger than her birth canal, and a weak predictor of PVM tear risk.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

These cells interact with each other directly when fibroblasts migrate to a region of the wound where they induce keratinocytes proliferation through double paracrine signalling. Since a response from both keratinocytes and fibroblasts dominates during the inflammatory and proliferative phases, the exact knowledge how these two types of cells interact with each other is crucial for deeper understanding of mechanisms involved in the wound healing process. The aim of this study was to quantify alterations in mechanical properties of cells, i.e. fibroblasts and keratinocytes, in conditions mimicking direct cellular interactions observed in wound healing. Single cell elasticity was measured using atomic force microscope. To verify the influence of keratinocyte neighbors on fibroblasts elasticity (and vice versa), the effect of cellular confluency was studied in parallel. Our results enabled us to distinguish cellular density-related effects from intercellular interactions occurring between fibroblasts and keratinocytes. While the presence of keratinocytes affects fibroblasts spreading capability and mechanical properties, the keratinocytes remain unaffected by the fibroblasts. These results highlight the importance of the cellular deformability in understanding of the role of biomechanics in double paracrine signalling as fibroblast-keratinocyte interaction can change the potential of the wound healing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While these responses have been connected to increased friction, the mechanisms behind this response remain unknown. Here, we combine a frictional bioreactor with confocal elastography and image-based cellular assays to establish the link between cartilage friction, microscale shear strain, and acute, adverse cellular responses. Our incorporation of cell-scale strain measurements reveals that elevated friction generates high shear strains localized near the tissue surface, and that these elevated strains are closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and cell death. Collectively, our data establish two pathways by which chondrocytes negatively respond to friction: an immediate necrotic response and a longer term pathway involving mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Specifically, in the surface region, where shear strains can exceed 0.07, cells are predisposed to acute death; however, below this surface region, cells exhibit a pathway consistent with apoptosis in a manner predicted by local shear strains. These data reveal a mechanism through which cellular damage in cartilage arises from compromised lubrication and show that in addition to boundary lubricants, there are opportunities upstream of apoptosis to preserve chondrocyte health in arthritis therapy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, most studies in the literature are limited to a few patients and results are hard to generalize. This study aims to provide a new framework to generate more generalized insights into LV blood flow as a function of changes in anatomy and wall motion. In this framework, we studied the four-dimensional blood flow in LV via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with a statistical shape model (SSM), built from segmented LV shapes of 150 subjects. We validated results in an in-vitro dynamic phantom via time-resolved optical particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements.

For sciatic nerve blocks, the optimal placement of the needle tip between its paraneural sheath and epineurial covering is challenging, even under ultrasound guidance, and frequently results in nerve puncture. We performed needle penetration tests on cadaveric isolated paraneural sheath (IPS), isolated nerve (IN), and the nerve with overlying paraneural sheath (NPS), and quantified puncture force requirement and fracture toughness of these specimens to assess their role in determining the clinical risk of nerve puncture. We found that puncture force (123 ± 17 mN) and fracture toughness (45.48 ± 9.72 J m-2) of IPS was significantly lower than those for NPS (1440 ± 161 mN and 1317.46 ± 212.45 Jm-2, respectively), suggesting that it is not possible to push the tip of the block needle through the paraneural sheath only, without pushing it into the nerve directly, when the sheath is lying directly over the nerve.

Community ambulation requires performance of steady-state level walking as well as tasks that require walking adaptability. Prior studies on balance control post-stroke have mainly focused on steady-state walking, but walking adaptability tasks have received little attention. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare dynamic balance requirements during common walking adaptability tasks post-stroke and in healthy adults and identify differences in underlying mechanisms used for maintaining dynamic balance. Kinematic data were collected from fifteen individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis during steady-state forward and backward walking, obstacle negotiation, and step-up tasks. In addition, data from ten healthy adults provided the basis for comparison. Dynamic balance was quantified using the peak-to-peak range of whole-body angular-momentum in each anatomical plane during the paretic, nonparetic and healthy control single-leg-stance phase of the gait cycle. To understand differences in some of the key underlying mechanisms for maintaining dynamic balance, foot placement and plantarflexor muscle activation were examined. Individuals post-stroke had significant dynamic balance deficits in the frontal plane across most tasks, particularly during the paretic single-leg-stance. Frontal plane balance deficits were associated with wider paretic foot placement, elevated body center-of-mass, and lower soleus activity. Further, the obstacle negotiation task imposed a higher balance requirement, particularly during the trailing leg single-stance. Thus, improving paretic foot placement and ankle plantarflexor activity, particularly during obstacle negotiation, may be important rehabilitation targets to enhance dynamic balance during post-stroke community ambulation.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Its study can help in identifying pathologies related to the vocal folds according to the values obtained through the different ways to measure it. This paper aims to propose a stochastic model, considering three control parameters, to generate jitter based on a deterministic one-mass model for the dynamics of the vocal folds and to identify parameters from the stochastic model taking into account real voice signals experimentally obtained. To solve the corresponding stochastic inverse problem, the cost function used is based on the distance between probability density functions of the random variables associated with the fundamental frequencies obtained by the experimental voices and the simulated ones, and also on the distance between features extracted from the voice signals, simulated and experimental, to calculate jitter. The results obtained show that the model proposed is valid and some samples of voices are synthesized considering the identified parameters for normal and pathological cases. The strategy adopted is also a novelty and mainly because a solution was obtained. In addition to the use of three parameters to construct the model of jitter, it is the discussion of a parameter related to the bandwidth of the power spectral density function of the stochastic process to measure the quality of the signal generated. A study about the influence of all the main parameters is also performed. The identification of the parameters of the model considering pathological cases is maybe of all novelties introduced by the paper the most interesting.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Consequently, accurate determination of effectiveness is important. When devices with advanced technology are used, it is possible that confirmation bias - the tendency for a user to actually experience what he or she expects to experience - will influence outcomes. This study assessed confirmation bias in 18 healthy young adults walking in knee braces. Participants wore two identical braces, but one was cosmetically modified and participants were told that it was a prototype computerized brace that could dynamically alter its stiffness. Before using the braces, the majority of users indicated a preference for the ""computerized"" brace. Actual walking showed no differences between the two braces. Following walking, users maintained preference for the ""computerized"" brace, indicating the presence of confirmation bias. These results underscore the importance of blinding when self-reported outcomes are used and the need to consider a placebo effect when comparing orthopedic devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here we show how treating the entire foot as a rigid body can lead to misunderstandings related to (biological and prosthetic) foot function, and distort our understanding of ankle and muscle-tendon dynamics. We overview various (unconventional) inverse dynamics methods for estimating foot power, partitioning ankle vs. foot contributions, and computing combined anklefoot power. We present two case study examples. The first exemplifies how modeling the foot as a single rigid-body segment causes us to overestimate (and overvalue) muscle-tendon power generated about the biological ankle (in this study by up to 77%), and to misestimate (and misinform on) foot contributions; corroborating findings from previous multi-segment foot modeling studies. The second case study involved an individual with transtibial amputation walking on 8 different prosthetic feet. The results exemplify how assuming a rigid foot can skew comparisons between biological and prosthetic limbs, and lead to incorrect conclusions when comparing different prostheses/interventions. Based on analytical derivations, empirical findings and prior literature we recommend against computing conventional ankle power (between shank-foot). Instead, we recommend using an alternative estimate of power generated about the ankle joint complex (between shank-calcaneus) in conjunction with an estimate of foot power (between calcaneus-ground); or using a combined anklefoot power calculation. We conclude that treating the entire foot as a rigid-body segment is often inappropriate and ill-advised.

Recent studies proposed an original saddle-shaped, skewed, truncated cone with laterally oriented apex, as tibiotalar contact surfaces for ankle prosthesis. The goal of this study was to compare in vitro this novel design with traditional cylindrical or medially centered conic geometries in terms of their ability to replicate the natural ankle joint mechanics. Ten lower limb cadaver specimens underwent a validated process of custom design for the replacement of the natural ankle joint. The process included medical imaging, 3D modeling and printing of implantable sets of artificial articular surfaces based on these three geometries. Kinematics and flexibility of the overall ankle complex, along with the separate ankle and subtalar joints, were measured under cyclic loading. In the neutral and in maximum plantarflexion positions, the range of motion under torques in the three anatomical planes of the three custom artificial surfaces was not significantly different from that of the natural surfaces. In maximum dorsiflexion the difference was significant for all three artificial surfaces at the ankle complex, and only for the cylindrical and medially centered conic geometries at the tibiotalar joint. Natural joint flexibility was restored by the artificial surfaces nearly in all positions. The present study provides experimental support for designing articular surfaces matching the specific morphology of the ankle to be replace, and lays the foundations of the overall process for designing and manufacturing patient-specific total ankle replacements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, this knowledge is not easily applicable in clinical scenarios due to the difficulty in measuring stress contours during complex tissue rearrangement procedures. Computational tools have been proposed as an alternative to address this need, but obtaining patient specific geometries with an affordable and flexible setup has remained a challenge. Here we present a methodology to determine the stress contours from a reconstructive procedure on a patient-specific finite element model based on multi-view stereo (MVS). MVS is a noninvasive technology that allows reconstruction of 3D geometries using a standard digital camera, making it ideal for the operating room. Finite element analysis can then be used on the patient-specific geometry to perform a virtual surgery and predict regions at risk of complications. We applied our approach to the case of a 7-year-old patient who was treated to correct a cranial contour deformity and resect two large areas of scalp scarring. The simulation showed several zones of high stress, particularly near the suture lines at the distal ends of the flaps. The patient did show delayed healing and partial flap tip necrosis at one of such predicted regions at the 30-day follow up visit.

Seven weightlifters performed two cleans at 85% of their competition maximum while ground reaction forces and 3-D motion data were recorded. An inverse dynamics procedure was used to calculate hip, knee, and ankle NJM. Vertical and horizontal barbell motion data were extracted and, along with barbell mass, used as inputs to a NN. The NN was then trained to model the association between the mass and kinematics of the barbell and the calculated NJM for six weightlifters, the data from the remaining weightlifter was then used to test the performance of the NN - this was repeated 7 times with a k-fold cross-validation procedure to assess the NN accuracy. Joint-specific predictions of NJM produced coefficients of determination (r2) that ranged from 0.79 to 0.95, and the percent difference between NN-predicted and inverse dynamics calculated peak NJM ranged between 5% and 16%. The NN was thus able to predict the spatiotemporal patterns and discrete peaks of the three NJM with reasonable accuracy, which suggests that it is feasible to predict lower extremity NJM from the mass and kinematics of the barbell. Future work is needed to determine whether combining a NN model with low cost technology (e.g., digital video and free digitising software) can also be used to predict NJM of weightlifters during field-testing situations, such as practice and competition, with comparable accuracy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This is achieved via weighted, time-dependent suppression of the proprioceptive signal. Though speculative, such dynamics are biologically plausible due to the presence of neuromodulators which have recently been experimentally implicated in the escape response, which includes an omega turn.

In healthy menisci, proteoglycan content is highest in the inner white zone and decreases towards the peripheral red zone. We hypothesized that loss of proteoglycans would reduce both osmotic swelling and compressive stiffness, spatially localized to the avascular white zone of the meniscus. This hypothesis was tested by targeted enzymatic digestion of proteoglycans using hyaluronidase in intact cervine medial menisci. Mechanics were quantified by creep indentation on the femoral surface. Osmotic swelling changes were assessed by measuring collagen fiber crimp period in the radial-axial plane in the lamellar layer along both the tibial and femoral contacting surfaces. All measurements were made in the inner, middle, and outer zones of the anterior, central, and posterior regions. Mechanical measurements showed variation in creep behavior with anatomical location, along with spatially uniform decreases in viscosity (average of 21%) and creep stiffness (average of 15%) with hyaluronidase treatment. Lamellar collagen crimp period was significantly decreased (average of 27%) by hyaluronidase, indicating a decrease in osmotic swelling, with the largest decreases seen in locations with the highest proteoglycan content.

Yet relationships between vGRF and RRI remain unclear - potentially because previous research has largely been constrained to collecting vGRFs in laboratory settings and ignoring relationships between RRI and stride number. In this preliminary proof-of-concept study, we addressed these constraints: Over a 60-day period, each time collegiate athletes (n = 9) ran they wore a hip-mounted activity monitor that collected accelerations throughout the entire run. Accelerations were used to estimate peak vGRF, number of strides, and weighted cumulative loading (sum of peak vGRFs weighted to the 9th power) across the entirety of each run. Runners also reported their post-training pain/fatigue and any RRI that prevented training.

Injured participants did, however, have significantly greater peak vGRFs (p = 0.01) and weighted cumulative loading per run (p < 0.01). Results from this small but extensively studied sample of elite runners demonstrate that loading profiles (load magnitude-number combinations) quantified with activity monitors can provide valuable information that may prove essential for: (1) testing hypotheses regarding overuse injury mechanisms, (2) developing injury-prediction models, and (3) designing and adjusting athlete- and loading-specific training programs and feedback.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Regulation of βcatenin in the cytoplasm has been well studied but βcatenin nuclear trafficking and function remains unclear. In a previous study we showed that, in mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), mechanical blockade of adipogenesis relied on inhibition of βcatenin destruction complex element GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) to increase nuclear βcatenin as well as the function of Linker of Cytoskeleton and Nucleoskeleton (LINC) complexes, suggesting that these two mechanisms may be linked. Here we show that shortly after inactivation of GSK3β due to either low intensity vibration (LIV), substrate strain or pharmacologic inhibition, βcatenin associates with the nucleoskeleton, defined as the insoluble nuclear fraction that provides structure to the integrated nuclear envelope, nuclear lamina and chromatin. Co-depleting LINC elements Sun-1 and Sun-2 interfered with both nucleoskeletal association and nuclear entry of βcatenin, resulting in decreased nuclear βcatenin levels. Our findings reveal that the insoluble structural nucleoskeleton actively participates in βcatenin dynamics. As the cytoskeleton transmits applied mechanical force to the nuclear surface to influence the nucleoskeleton and its LINC mediated interaction, our results suggest a pathway by which LINC mediated connectivity may play a role in signaling pathways that depend on nuclear access of βcatenin.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We used a hip impact simulator to determine how peak stresses at the femoral neck were affected by pelvis impact angle, hip abductor muscle force, and use of a wearable hip protector. We simulated falls from standing (2 m/s impact velocity) involving initial hip abductor muscle forces of 700 or 300 N. Trials were acquired for impact to the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter, and impact to the pelvis rotated 5°, 10° and 15° anteriorly (positive) or posteriorly (negative). Measures were acquired with and without a commercially available hip protector. During trials, we measured three-dimensional forces with a load cell at the femoral neck, and derived peak compressive and tensile stresses. Peak compressive stress increased 37% (5.91 versus 4.31 MPa; p < 0.0005) and peak tensile stress increased 209% (2.31 versus 0.75 MPa; p < 0.0005) when the pelvis impact angle changed from 15° anterior to -15° posterior. For lateral impacts, the peak tensile and compressive stresses averaged 73% and 8% lower, respectively, in the 700 N than 300 N muscle force condition, but the effect was reversed for anteriolateral or posteriolateral impacts. The attenuation in peak compressive stress from the hip protector was greatest for posteriolateral impacts (-15 to -5°; 36-41%), and least for anteriolateral (+15°; 10%).

We aimed to systematically address the effects of perturbation velocity on linearly estimated neuromechanical parameters. Using a single axis manipulator ramp and hold perturbations were applied to the wrist joint. Effects of perturbation velocity (0.5, 1 and 3 rad/s) were investigated at multiple background torque levels (0, 0.5 and 1 N·m). With increasing perturbation velocity, estimated joint stiffness remained constant, while damping and reflex gain decreased. This variation in model parameters is dependent on background torque levels, i.e. muscle contraction. These observations support the future development of nonlinear models that are capable of describing wrist joint behavior over a larger range of loading conditions, exceeding the restricted range of operation that is required for linearization.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Vocal fold vibration is driven by pressures on the vocal fold surface, which are determined by the shape of the glottis and the contact between vocal folds. Characterization of three-dimensional glottal shapes and contact patterns can lead to increased understanding of normal and abnormal physiology of the voice, as well as to development of improved vocal fold models, but a large inventory of shapes has not been directly studied previously. This study aimed to take an initial step toward characterizing vocal fold contact patterns systematically. Vocal fold motion and contact was modeled based on normal mode vibration, as it has been shown that vocal fold vibration can be almost entirely described by only the few lowest order vibrational modes. Symmetric and asymmetric combinations of the four lowest normal modes of vibration were superimposed on left and right vocal fold medial surfaces, for each of three prephonatory glottal configurations, according to a surface wave approach. Contact patterns were generated from the interaction of modal shapes at 16 normalized phases during the vibratory cycle. Eight major contact patterns were identified and characterized by the shape of the flow channel, with the following descriptors assigned: convergent, divergent, convergent-divergent, uniform, split, merged, island, and multichannel. Each of the contact patterns and its variation are described, and future work and applications are discussed.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nevertheless, users must consider system errors when evaluating their results. Most validation techniques for these systems are based on relative distance and displacement measurements. In contrast, our study aimed to analyse the absolute volume accuracy of optical motion capture systems by means of engineering surveying reference measurement of the marker coordinates (uncertainty: 0.75 mm). The method is exemplified on an 18 camera OptiTrack Flex13 motion capture system. The absolute accuracy was defined by the root mean square error (RMSE) between the coordinates measured by the camera system and by engineering surveying (micro-triangulation). The original RMSE of 1.82 mm due to scaling error was managed to be reduced to 0.77 mm while the correlation of errors to their distance from the origin reduced from 0.855 to 0.209. A simply feasible but less accurate absolute accuracy compensation method using tape measure on large distances was also tested, which resulted in similar scaling compensation compared to the surveying method or direct wand size compensation by a high precision 3D scanner. The presented validation methods can be less precise in some respects as compared to previous techniques, but they address an error type, which has not been and cannot be studied with the previous validation methods.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to understand the roles of carpal tunnel soft tissue mechanical properties and intratunnel pressure on the TCL tensile strain and carpal arch area (CAA) using finite element analysis (FEA). Manual segmentation of the thenar muscles, skin, fat, TCL, hamate bone, and trapezium bone in the transverse plane at distal carpal tunnel were obtained from B-mode ultrasound images of one cadaveric hand. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the dependence of TCL tensile strain and CAA on TCL elastic modulus (0.125-10 MPa volar-dorsally; 1.375-110 MPa transversely), skin-fat and thenar muscle initial shear modulus (1.6-160 kPa for skin-fat; 0.425-42.5 kPa for muscle), and intratunnel pressure (60-480 mmHg). Predictions of TCL tensile strain under different intratunnel pressures were validated with the experimental data obtained on the same cadaveric hand. Results showed that skin, fat and muscles had little effect on the TCL tensile strain and CAA changes. However, TCL tensile strain and CAA increased with decreased elastic modulus of TCL and increased intratunnel pressure. The TCL tensile strain and CAA increased linearly with increased pressure while increased exponentially with decreased elastic modulus of TCL. Softening the TCL by decreasing the elastic modulus may be an alternative clinical approach to carpal tunnel expansion to accommodate elevated intratunnel pressure and alleviate median nerve compression neuropathy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The exact cause of these wounds is unclear as little work has studied the interface between the prosthetic device and user. Our research objective was to develop a quantitative method for assessing displacement patterns of the gel liner during walking for patients with transtibial amputation. Using a reflective marker system and a custom clear socket, evaluations were conducted with a clear transparent test socket mounted over a plaster limb model and a deformable limb model. Distances between markers placed on the limb were measured with a digital caliper and then compared with data from the motion capture system. Additionally, the rigid plaster set-up was moved in the capture volume to simulate walking and evaluate if inter-marker distances changed in comparison to static data. Dynamic displacement trials were then collected to measure changes in inter-marker distance due to vertical elongation of the gel liner. Static and dynamic inter-marker distances within day and across days confirmed the ability to accurately capture displacements using this new approach. These results encourage this novel method to be applied to a sample of amputee patients during walking to assess displacements and the distribution of the liner deformation within the socket. The ability to capture changes in deformation of the gel liner will provide new data that will enable clinicians and researchers to improve design and fit of the prosthesis so the incidence of pressure ulcers can be reduced.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The causes of these differences in injury threshold are not known. In this study, we compared knee injury thresholds using a ""prone configuration"" and a ""supine configuration"" that differed with respect to hip, knee, and ankle flexion, and utilized different fixtures to stabilize the knee. Right limbs of female and male C57BL/6 mice were loaded using the prone configuration, while left limbs were loaded using the supine configuration. Mice underwent progressive loading from 2 to 20 N, or cyclic loading at 9 N or 14 N (n = 9-11/sex/loading method). Progressive loading with the prone configuration resulted in ACL rupture at an average of 10.2 ± 0.9 N for females and 11.4 ± 0.7 N for males. In contrast, progressive loading with the supine configuration resulted in ACL rupture in only 36% of female mice and 50% of male mice. Cyclic loading with the prone configuration resulted in ACL rupture after 15 ± 8 cycles for females and 24 ± 27 cycles for males at 9 N, and always during the first cycle for both sexes at 14 N. In contrast, cyclic loading with the supine configuration was able to complete 1,200 cycles at 9 N without injury for both sexes, and an average of 45 ± 41 cycles for females and 49 ± 25 cycles for males at 14 N before ACL rupture.

Thus, an appropriate non-Newtonian model is advisable; and we choose a Modified version of the rheological model of Phan-Thien and Tanner (MPTT). The different parameters of this model, derived from the rheology of polymers, allow characterization of the non-Newtonian nature of blood, taking into account the behavior of red blood cells in plasma. Using the MPTT model that we implemented in the open access software OpenFOAM, numerical simulations have been performed on blood flow in the thoracic aorta for a healthy patient. We started from a patient-specific model which was constructed from medical images. Exiting flow boundary conditions have been developped, based on a 3-element Windkessel model to approximate physiological conditions. The parameters of the Windkessel model were calibrated with in vivo measurements of flow rate and pressure. The influence of the selected viscosity of red blood cells on the flow and wall shear stress (WSS) was investigated. Results obtained from this model were compared to those of the Newtonian model, and to those of a generalized Newtonian model, as well as to in vivo dynamic data from 4D MRI during a cardiac cycle.

Nevertheless, clinical use of these models in paediatric applications is still limited for what concerns the estimation of muscle and joint contact forces. Aiming to improve the current state of the art, a methodology to generate highly personalized subject-specific musculoskeletal models of the lower limb based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was codified as a step-by-step procedure and applied to data from eight juvenile individuals. The generated musculoskeletal models were used to simulate 107 gait trials using stereophotogrammetric and force platform data as input. To ensure completeness of the modelling procedure, muscles' architecture needs to be estimated. Four methods to estimate muscles' maximum isometric force and two methods to estimate musculotendon parameters (optimal fiber length and tendon slack length) were assessed and compared, in order to quantify their influence on the models' output. Reported results represent the first comprehensive subject-specific model-based characterization of juvenile gait biomechanics, including profiles of joint kinematics and kinetics, muscle forces and joint contact forces.

In multiple linear regression models, foot fat content, height of the medial longitudinal arch and static hind foot angle were not associated with the magnitude of the knee adduction moment (R2 = 0.24, p = 0.060), knee adduction angular impulse (R2 = 0.21, p = 0.099) or 3D resultant knee moment (R2 = 0.23, p = 0.073) during gait. Furthermore, these foot structure parameters were not associated with the patients' biomechanical response to medial or lateral wedge footwear insoles (all p < 0.01).

Indentation and gliding resistance tests were performed on cadaveric specimens to verify the model. Results showed that after silicone gel injection into the tendon, a significant increase in thickness was found. In addition, no significant difference was found in the toe region compressive modulus of the tendon after injection. Moreover, maximum, drop of gliding resistance and work of extension were all found to be significantly larger as the severity of triggering increased.

Therefore, it seems relevant to evaluate the factors which dictate ECTS, namely the amount and velocity of shortening, since it is likely these factors will dictate Erun. Erun and triceps surae morphological and AT mechanical properties were obtained in 46 trained and elite male and female distance runners using ultrasonography and dynamometry. ECTS (J·stride-1) at the speed of lactate threshold (sLT) was estimated from AT force and crossbridge mechanics and energetics. To estimate the relative impact of these factors on ECTS, mean values for running speed, body mass, resting fascicle length (Lf), Achilles tendon stiffness and moment arm and maximum isometric plantarflexion torque were obtained. ECTS was calculated across a range (mean ± 1 sd) of values for each independent factor. Average sLT was 233 m·min-1. At this speed, ECTS was 255 J·stride-1. Estimated fascicle shortening velocity was 0.08 Vmax and the level of muscle activation was 84.7% of maximum isometric torque. Compared to the ECTS calculated from the lowest range of values obtained for each independent factor, higher AT stiffness was associated with a 39% reduction in ECTS, 81% reduction in fascicle shortening velocity and a 31% reduction in muscle activation. Longer AT moment arms and elevated body masses were associated with an increase in ECTS of 18% and 23%, respectively.

Absolute and relative reliability were assessed by measurement error and intra-class correlation coefficient. The SPM analysis revealed time dependent differences in the effect of speed.

Mechanical behaviour at low stretches is governed by fibril straightening, transitioning into load-bearing at recruitment stretch, resulting in a tissue stiffening effect. Previous investigations have suggested theoretical relationships between stress-stretch measurements and recruitment probability density function (PDF) but not derived these rigorously nor evaluated these experimentally. Other work has proposed image-based methods for measurement of recruitment but made use of arbitrary fibril critical straightness parameters. The aim of this work was to provide a sound theoretical basis for estimating recruitment PDF from stress-stretch measurements and to evaluate this relationship using image-based methods, clearly motivating the choice of fibril critical straightness parameter in rat tail tendon and porcine artery. Rigorous derivation showed that the recruitment PDF may be estimated from the second stretch derivative of the first Piola-Kirchoff tissue stress. Image-based fibril recruitment identified the fibril straightness parameter that maximised Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) with estimated PDFs. Using these critical straightness parameters the new method for estimating recruitment PDF showed a PCC with image-based measures of 0.915 and 0.933 for tendons and arteries respectively.

Ten healthy women performed isokinetic maximal internal/external concentric/eccentric shoulder rotation movements. The hand and elbow contact forces were measured using two six-axis force sensors. The main finding is that the contact forces at the hand were not purely tangential to the direction of the movement (effectiveness indexes from 0.26 ± 0.25 to 0.54 ± 0.20), such that the resulting shoulder torque computed from the two force sensors was three-dimensional.

Our findings highlighted the CPP hydropathy strongly correlated with penetration of water molecules in the lipid bilayer, thus supporting the hypothesis that the amount of water each CPP can route inside the membrane is modulated by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic character of the peptide.

Impact may occur during events ranging from trauma to surgical insertion of an OsteoChondral Graft (OCG) into an OsteoChondral Recipient site (OCR). To evaluate energy density as a mediator of cartilage damage, a specialized drop tower apparatus was used to impact adult bovine samples while measuring contact force, cartilage surface displacement, and OCG advancement. When a single impact was applied to an isolated (non-inserted) OCG, force and surface displacement each rose monotonically and then declined. In each of five sequential impacts of increasing magnitude, applied to insert an OCG into an OCR, force rose rapidly to an initial peak, with minimal OCG advancement, and then to a second prolonged peak, with distinctive oscillations. Energy delivered to cartilage was confirmed to be higher with larger drop height and mass, and found to be lower with an interposed cushion or OCG insertion into an OCR. For both single and multiple impacts, the total energy density delivered to the articular cartilage correlated to damage, quantified as total crack length. The corresponding fracture toughness of the articular cartilage was 12.0 mJ/mm2. Thus, the biomechanics of OCG insertion exhibits distinctive features compared to OCG impact without insertion, with energy delivery to the articular cartilage being a factor highly correlated with damage.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Specimens were subjected to three cycles of sub-failure loading (10-100 N, 1 mm/s) in each direction, before being failed in a randomly assigned direction (10 mm/s). Facet deflection, surface strains, stiffness, and failure load were measured. Linear mixed-effects models (α = 0.05; random effect of cadaver) accounted for variations in specimen geometry and bone density. Specimen-specific parameters were significantly associated with most outcome measures. Facet stiffness and failure load were significantly greater in the simulated flexion loading direction, and deflection and surface strains were higher in anterior shear at the non-destructive analysis point (47 N applied load). The sub-failure strains and stiffness responses differed between the upper and lower subaxial cervical regions. Failure occurred through the facet tip during anterior shear loading, while failure through the pedicles was most common in flexion.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

WSS acts as a link between blood flow dynamics and the biology of various cardiovascular diseases. WSS has been of great interest in a wide range of studies and has been the most popular measure to correlate blood flow to cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have emphasized different vectorial features of WSS. However, fixed points in the WSS vector field have not received much attention. A WSS fixed point is a point on the vessel wall where the WSS vector vanishes. In this article, WSS fixed points are classified and the aspects by which they could influence cardiovascular disease are reviewed. First, the connection between WSS fixed points and the flow topology away from the vessel wall is discussed. Second, the potential role of time-averaged WSS fixed points in biochemical mass transport is demonstrated using the recent concept of Lagrangian WSS structures. Finally, simple measures are proposed to quantify the exposure of the endothelial cells to WSS fixed points. Examples from various arterial flow applications are demonstrated.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Under some circumstances, dying cells actively contract and cause their neighbors to rearrange and maintain tissue integrity. Under other circumstances, dying cells leave behind gaps, which results in tissue separation. A better understanding of how the cellular scale features of cell death manifest on the population scale has implications ranging from morphogenesis to tumor response to treatment. However, the mechanistic relationship between cell death and population scale shrinkage is not well understood, and computational methods for studying these relationships are not well established. Here we propose a mechanically robust agent-based cell model designed to capture the implications of cell death on the population scale. In our agent-based model, algorithmic rules applied on the cellular level emerge on the population scale where their effects are quantified. To better quantify model uncertainty and parameter interactions, we implement a recently developed technique for conducting a variance-based sensitivity analysis on the stochastic model. From this analysis and subsequent investigation, we find that cellular scale shrinkage has the largest influence of all model parameters tested, and that by adjusting cellular scale shrinkage population shrinkage varies widely even across simulations which contain the same fraction of dying cells. We anticipate that the methods and results presented here are a starting point for significant future investigation toward quantifying the implications of different mechanisms of cell death on population and tissue scale behavior.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However little guidance is given by the ASTM standard on test configurations such as medial-lateral (M:L) loading distribution, flexion angle or restriction of secondary motions. Using a purpose built rig for a materials testing machine, four TKRs currently in widespread clinical use, including medial-pivot and symmetrical condyle types, were tested for anterior-posterior translational constraint. Compressive joint loads from 710 to 2000 N, and a range of medial-lateral (M:L) load distributions, from 70:30% to 30:70% M:L, were applied at different flexion angles with secondary motions unconstrained. It was found that TKA constraint was significantly less at 60 and 90° flexion than at 0°, whilst increasing the compressive joint load increased the force required to translate the tibia to limits of AP constraint at all flexion angles tested. Additionally when M:L load distribution was shifted medially, a coupled internal rotation was observed with anterior translation and external rotation with posterior translation.

Due to these problems, individual EMGs exhibit uncertainty in representing their corresponding muscle activations. To regulate this uncertainty, we proposed an EMG refinement, which refines EMGs with regulating the contribution redundancy of the signals from EMGs to approximating torques through EMG-driven torque estimation (EDTE) using the muscular skeletal forward dynamic model. To regulate this redundancy, we must consider the synergistic contribution redundancy of muscles, including ""unmeasured"" muscles, to approximating torques, which primarily causes redundancy of EDTE. To suppress this redundancy, we used the concept of muscle synergy, which is a key concept of analyzing the neurophysiological regulation of contribution redundancy of muscles to exerting torques. Based on this concept, we designed a muscle-synergy-based EDTE as a framework for EMG refinement, which regulates the abovementioned uncertainty of individual EMGs in consideration of unmeasured muscles. In achieving the proposed EMG refinement, the most considerable point is to suppress a large change such as overestimation attributed to enhancement of the contribution of particular muscles to estimating torques. Therefore it is reasonable to refine EMGs by minimizing the change in EMGs. To evaluate this model, we used a Bland-Altman plot, which quantitatively evaluates the proportional bias of refined signals to EMGs. Through this evaluation, we showed that the proposed EDTE minimizes the bias while approximating torques. Therefore this minimization optimally regulates the uncertainty of EMGs and thereby leads to optimal EMG refinement.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The effects of strain, anisotropy, and region on the hydraulic permeability in meniscus tissue have not been fully elucidated. Using a one-dimensional direct permeation test, we measured the hydraulic permeability within statically compressed porcine meniscus specimens, prepared such that the explants were in either the axial or circumferential direction of either the central or horn (axial direction only) region of the medial and lateral menisci. A constant flow was applied and the pressure difference was measured using pressure transducers. Specimens were tested under 10-20% compressive strain.

However, diverse findings have been reported in the literature. In the present study, high-resolution hemodynamic simulations were performed retrospectively on 35 aneurysms (10 ruptured & 25 unruptured) located at the internal carotid artery (ICA). Simulated hemodynamic parameters were statistically compared between the ruptured and unruptured aneurysms, with emphasis on examining the correlation of flow instability with the status of aneurysm rupture. Pronounced flow instability was detected in 20% (2 out of 10) of the ruptured aneurysms, whereas in 44% (11 out of 25) of the unruptured aneurysms. Statistically, the flow instability metric (quantified by the temporally and spatially averaged fluctuating kinetic energy over the aneurysm sac) did not differ significantly between the ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. In contrast, low wall shear stress area (LSA) and pressure loss coefficient (PLC) exhibited significant correlations with the status of aneurysm rupture. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the presence of flow instability may not correlate closely with the status of aneurysm rupture, at least for ICA aneurysms. On the other hand, the retrospective nature of the study and the small sample size may have to some extent compromised the reliability of the conclusion, and therefore large-scale prospective studies would be needed to further address the issue.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We sought to determine if common ultrasound-based estimates of AT length change were consistent with expectations for a passive elastic tendon acting in series with a muscle. We tested 8 healthy individuals during restricted joint calf contractions (high force, low displacement), ankle dorsi-/plantar-flexion (DF/PF) with the foot in the air (low force, high displacement), and heel raises (high force, high displacement). We experimentally estimated AT length change using two ultrasound methods, one based on muscle-tendon junction (MTJ) tracking and one based on muscle fascicle (MF) tracking. Estimates of AT length change were consistent with model expectations during restricted calf contractions, when the MTU underwent minimal length change. However, estimates of AT length changes were inconsistent with model expectations during the ankle DF/PF and heel raise tasks. Specifically, the AT was estimated to shorten substantially, often 10-20 mm, when the ankle plantarflexed beyond neutral position, despite loading conditions in which a passive, stiff spring would be expected to either lengthen (under increasing force) or maintain its length (under low force). These unexpected findings suggest the need for improvements in how we conceptually model and/or experimentally estimate MTU dynamics in vivo during motion analysis studies, particularly when the ankle plantarflexes beyond neutral.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study examined the concurrent validity of a IMS (Xsens MVN system) for measuring lower extremity and pelvis kinematics in comparison to a Vicon motion analysis system (MAS) during kicking. Thirty footballers from Australian football (n = 10), soccer (n = 10), rugby league and rugby union (n = 10) clubs completed 20 kicks across four conditions. Concurrent validity was assessed using a linear mixed-modelling approach, which allowed the partition of between and within-subject variance from the device measurement error. Results were expressed in raw and standardised units for assessments of differences in means and measurement error, and interpreted via non-clinical magnitude-based inferences. Trivial to small differences were found in linear velocities (foot and pelvis), angular velocities (knee, shank and thigh), sagittal joint (knee and hip) and segment angle (shank and pelvis) means (mean difference: 0.2-5.8%) between the IMS and MAS in Australian football, soccer and the rugby codes. Trivial to small measurement errors (from 0.1 to 5.8%) were found between the IMS and MAS in all kinematic parameters. The IMS demonstrated acceptable levels of concurrent validity compared to a MAS when measuring kicking biomechanics across the four football codes. Wearable IMS offers various benefits over MAS, such as, out-of-laboratory testing, larger measurement range and quick data output, to help improve the ecological validity of biomechanical testing and the timing of feedback. The results advocate the use of IMS to quantify biomechanics of high-velocity movements in sport-specific settings.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recently, small inertial sensors became available which allow for the registration of limb-position outside of the limited space of gait laboratories. The computation of gait parameters based on such recordings has been the subject of many scientific papers. We want to add to this knowledge by presenting a 4-segment leg model which is based on inverse kinematic and Kalman filtering of data from inertial sensors. To evaluate the model, data from four leg segments (shanks and thighs) were recorded synchronously with accelerometers and gyroscopes and a 3D motion capture system while subjects (n = 12) walked at three different velocities on a treadmill. Angular position of leg segments was computed from accelerometers and gyroscopes by Kalman filtering and compared to data from the motion capture system. The four-segment leg model takes the stance foot as a pivotal point and computes the position of the remaining segments as a kinematic chain (inverse kinematics). Second, we evaluated the contribution of pelvic movements to the model and evaluated a five segment model (shanks, thighs and pelvis) against ground-truth data from the motion capture system and the path of the treadmill.


RESULTS
We found the precision of the Kalman filtered angular position is in the range of 2-6° (RMS error). The 4-segment leg model computed stride length and length of gait path with a constant undershoot of 3% for slow and 7% for fast gait. The integration of a 5th segment (pelvis) into the model increased its precision. The advantages of this model and ideas for further improvements are discussed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unfortunately, clinical assessments of spine function do not objectively evaluate this important attribute, which reflects speed of trunk control. Speed of trunk control can be parsed into two components: (1) delay, the time it takes to initiate a movement, and (2) lag, the time it takes to execute a movement once initiated. The goal of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to assess delay and lag in trunk control using a simple tracking task. Ten healthy subjects performed four blocks of six trials of trunk tracking in the sagittal plane. Delay and lag were estimated by modeling trunk control for predictable and unpredictable (control mode) trunk movements in flexion and extension (control direction) at movement amplitudes of 2°, 4°, and 6° (control amplitude). The main effect of control mode, direction, and amplitude of movement were compared between trial blocks to assess secondary influencers (e.g., fatigue). Only control mode was consistent across trial blocks with predictable movements being faster than unpredictable for both delay and lag. Control direction and amplitude effects on delay and lag were consistent across the first two trial blocks and less consistent in later blocks. Given the heterogeneity in the presentation of back pain, clinical assessment of trunk control should include different control modes, directions, and amplitudes. To reduce testing time and the influence of fatigue, we recommend six trials to assess trunk control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The intraclass coefficient for most muscles and the Achilles tendon ranged from 0.53 to 0.99 for all parameters. The percentage standard error of the measurement for many parameters in most muscles and the Achilles tendon was less than 10%. Bland-Altman analysis showed a high agreement for all mechanical properties. No significant differences were observed in any muscle or Achilles tendon properties between days (all p > 0.05).

Nine tri-axial accelerometers were used to measure acceleration at the WBV platform, and the head, third lumbar vertebra, and bilateral hips, knees, and ankles. The results indicated that WBV amplitude, frequency, body postures and their interactions significantly influenced the vibration transmissibility and signal purity among people with chronic stroke. In all anatomical landmarks except the ankle, the transmissibility decreased with increased frequency, increased amplitude or increased knee flexion angle. The transmissibility was similar between the paretic and non-paretic side, except at the ankle during tip-toe standing. Less severe lower limb motor impairment was associated with greater transmissibility at the paretic ankle, knee and hip in certain WBV conditions.

Because of the biomechanical trade-off between speed and accuracy, athletes must balance these competing demands. Modelling the optimal compromise between speed and accuracy requires one to quantifyhow task speed affects the dispersion around a target, a level of experimental detail not previously addressed. Using soccer penalties as a system, we measured two-dimensional kicking error over a range of speeds, target heights, and kicking techniques. Twenty experienced soccer players executed a total of 8466 kicks at two targets (high and low). Players kicked with the side of their foot or the instep at ball speeds ranging from 40% to 100% of their maximum. The inaccuracy of kicks was measured in horizontal and vertical dimensions. For both horizontal and vertical inaccuracy, variance increased as a power function of speed, whose parameter values depended on the combination of kicking technique and target height. Kicking precision was greater when aiming at a low target compared to a high target. Side-foot kicks were more accurate than instep kicks. The centre of the dispersion of shots shifted as a function of speed.

Infrared (1300 nm) PSOCT was performed during uniaxial tensile loading of fresh scleral specimens of rabbits, cows, and humans from limbal, equatorial, and peripapillary regions. Specimens from 8 human eyes were obtained. Specimens were stretched to failure at 0.01 mm/s constant rate under physiological conditions of temperature and humidity while birefringence was computed every 117 ms from cross-sectional PSOCT. Birefringence modulus (BM) was defined as the rate of birefringence change with strain, and tensile modulus (TM) as the rate of stress change between 0 and 9% strain.

Actuators have been placed on the femur and pelvis, and on ""grounded"" locations external to the specimen, but the consequences of this placement for knee kinematics and kinetics are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine these effects using a validated computational musculoskeletal model. When the actuator was placed on the femur or pelvis, forces realistically increased with knee flexion, with quadriceps and patellofemoral contact forces exceeding 2000 N and 3000 N, respectively, at 100° flexion. When the actuator was grounded, however, forces were substantially reduced and did not monotonically increase with flexion. Articular joint contact forces were not strongly influenced by changing the location of the actuator from the femur to the pelvis, with small RMS differences in quadriceps forces (48.2 N), patellofemoral forces (83.6 N), and tibiofemoral forces (58.9 N) between these conditions. The location of the actuator did not substantially affect knee kinematics. The results of this study suggest that the quadriceps actuator of the Oxford Rig should be attached to either the femur or the pelvis when the goal is to make realistic estimates of quadriceps forces and articular contact forces within the knee joint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A nerve stimulation protocol during dynamic contractions of the quadriceps was developed that employed triplets of supramaximal pulses to assess suppressed eccentric activation. Subsequently the effects of a short training intervention, performed on a dynamometer, on eccentric strength output and neural inhibition were examined. Torque-angular velocity (T-ω) and experimental voluntary neural drive-angular velocity (%VA-ω; %VA, obtained via the interpolated twitch technique) datasets, were obtained from pre- and post-training testing sessions. Non-linear regression fits of a seven parameter torque function and of a 3rd degree polynomial were performed on the pre- and post-training T-ω and %VA-ω datasets respectively. T-test showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the overall torque output post-training for the group, with three out of the six subjects demonstrating a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the torque output across the range of angular velocities as shown by the extra-sum-of-squares F-test.

This study aimed to describe the existence of a directional bias in the translational and rotational errors of skin-mounted trackers using a 3D magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) protocol. 3D-MRI scans of the healthy right shoulders of 19 males were acquired in 12 arm positions. The relative transformation of the scapular configuration determined to be the measurement error, as recorded by the configuration of the small cuboid imitating a skin-mounted tracker relative to the actual scapular configuration measured by the voxel-based registration. These measurement errors were expressed with either positive or negative values to describe the bias. Overall translational errors in the lateral, anterior, and superior directions were 3.7 ± 8.4 mm, 9.5 ± 6.4 mm, and 6.2 ± 4.6 mm, respectively. Overall rotational errors in protraction, upward rotation, and posterior tilt were 7.8 ± 8.4°, 0.2 ± 7.4°, and - 4.0 ± 7.5°, respectively. The skin-mounted tracker displayed a high probability of displacement in antero-superior (93% and 91%) directions and rotates in a protracting manner (82%) relative to the position of the underlying bone with the gradual nature of its change. The existence of the directional bias with its gradual change suggests a statistical predictability in measurement errors, which can be used to predict accurate scapular translation and rotation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that in patients undergoing THA, inter-joint coordination (i) is different from control subjects before surgery, (ii) changes from pre-operative to post-operative, and (iii) remains different from control subjects after surgery. Seventy-eight subjects underwent gait analysis before and ∼1 year after primary unilateral THA. 109 control subjects were age, sex, and BMI matched to the THA group. We selected a representative trial at each subjects' self-selected walking speed from a motion analysis data repository. To assess kinematic coordination, we constructed sagittal plane hip-knee angle cyclograms, and calculated total, stance, and swing phase plot area (deg2). To assess kinetic coordination, we calculated the support moment (MS, %wt ∗ ht), the time-integral of support moment (MS impulse, %wt ∗ ht ∗ t), and the relative contribution of each joint to MS impulse (%Hip, %Knee, %Ankle). We used t-tests to compare groups. Total and swing-phase cyclogram area was smaller preoperatively, but improved to control values after THA. Swing-phase area was smaller than control values after THA. MS impulse was larger in THA subjects than controls both before and after surgery. While, the relative contribution of the hip to MS impulse was not different from control values, the contributions of the knee and ankle were smaller. Inter-joint coordination, as measured by hip-knee angle cyclograms and MS impulse, may be used to distinguish differences in gait mechanics between osteoarthritis and THA.

Little in vivo information is available on the impact of static neck flexion on cervical spinal tissue. The aim of this study was to assess changes in mechanical and neuromuscular behaviors to sustained neck flexion in healthy adults. Sixty healthy subjects aged 20-35 years participated in this study. The participants were exposed to static neck flexion at a fixed angle of full flexion for 10 min. Mechanical and neuromuscular responses of the cervical spine to sudden perturbations were measured pre- and post-exposure. Magnitude of load-relaxation during flexion exposure, stiffness, peak head angular velocity, and reflexive activities of cervical muscles were recorded. Effective neck stiffness decreased significantly, especially in female participants (P = 0.0001). The reflexive response of the cervical erector spinae muscles to head perturbation delayed significantly (P = 0.0001). Peak head angular velocity was significantly increased after exposure to neck flexion for 10 min, especially in female participants (P = 0.001). In the present study, static flexion resulted in changes in mechanical and neuromuscular behavior of the cervical spine, potentially leading to decreased stiffness of the cervical spine. The results confirm the importance of maintaining a correct head and neck position during work and improving the work environment to reduce the cervical spinal load and work-related neck pain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The ability to counteract perturbations is an indicator of neuromuscular function but if the response is insufficient the risk of falls will increase. However, it is unknown how load carriage affects older adults. Fourteen older adults (65 ± 6 years) attended a single visit during which they performed 4 min of walking in 3 conditions, unloaded, stable backpack load and unstable backpack load. During each walking trial, 3-dimensional kinematics of the lower limb and trunk movements and electromyographic activity of 6 lower limb muscles were recorded. The local dynamic stability (local divergence exponents), joint angle variability and spatio-temporal variability were determined along with muscle activation magnitudes. Medio-lateral dynamic stability was lower (p = 0.018) and step width (p = 0.019) and step width variability (p = 0.015) were greater in unstable load walking and step width variability was greater in stable load walking (p = 0.009) compared to unloaded walking. However, there was no effect on joint angle variability. Unstable load carriage increased activity of the Rectus Femoris (p = 0.001) and Soleus (p = 0.043) and stable load carriage increased Rectus Femoris activity (p = 0.006). These results suggest that loaded walking alters the gait of older adults and that unstable load carriage reduces dynamic stability compared to unloaded walking.

Kinematic measurements associated with skin-mounted markers are subject to soft tissue artifacts (STA), since the markers follow skin movement, thus generating errors when used to represent motions of underlying bone segments. We present a novel ultrasound tracking system that is capable of directly measuring tibial and femoral bone surfaces during dynamic motions, and subsequently measuring six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) tibiofemoral kinematics. The aim of this study is to quantitatively compare the accuracy of tibiofemoral kinematics estimated by the ultrasound tracking system and by a conventional skin-mounted marker based motion capture system in a cadaveric experimental scenario. Two typical tibiofemoral joint models (spherical and hinge models) were used to derive relevant kinematic outcomes. Intra-cortical bone pins equipped with optical markers were inserted in the tibial and femoral bones to serve as a reference to provide ground truth kinematics. The ultrasound tracking system resulted in lower kinematic errors than the skin-mounted markers (the ultrasound tracking system: maximum root-mean-square (RMS) error 3.44° for rotations and 4.88 mm for translations, skin-mounted markers with the spherical joint model: 6.32° and 6.26 mm, the hinge model: 6.38° and 6.52 mm). Our proposed ultrasound tracking system has the potential of measuring direct bone kinematics, thereby mitigating the influence and propagation of STA.

This paper leverages recent advances in dynamical systems theory to accurately estimate the stability of human motion without requiring perturbation. This approach relies on kinematic observations of a nominal Sit-to-Stand motion to construct an individual-specific dynamic model, input bounds, and feedback control that are then used to compute the set of perturbations from which the model can recover.

A primary resource for encapsulating this range of variability is the biofidelity response corridor or BRC. In the field of injury biomechanics, BRCs are often used for development and validation of both physical, such as anthropomorphic test devices, and computational models. For the purpose of generating corridors, post-mortem human surrogates were tested across a range of loading conditions relevant to under-body blast events. To sufficiently cover the wide range of input conditions, a relatively small number of tests were performed across a large spread of conditions. The high volume of required testing called for leveraging the capabilities of multiple impact test facilities, all with slight variations in test devices. A method for assessing similitude of responses between test devices was created as a metric for inclusion of a response in the resulting BRC. The goal of this method was to supply a statistically sound, objective method to assess the similitude of an individual response against a set of responses to ensure that the BRC created from the set was affected primarily by biological variability, not anomalies or differences stemming from test devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Due to patient variability, differences in apical wall thickness affects cannula insertion lengths, potentially promoting unfavourable intraventricular flow patterns which are thought to be correlated to the risk of thrombosis. This study aimed to present a 3D multiscale computational fluid dynamic model of the left ventricle (LV) developed using a commercial software, Ansys, and evaluate the risk of thrombosis with varying inflow cannula insertion lengths in a severely dilated LV. Based on a HeartWare HVAD inflow cannula, insertion lengths of 5, 19, 24 and 50 mm represented cases of apical hypertrophy, typical ranges of apical thicknesses and an experimental length, respectively. The risk of thrombosis was evaluated based on blood washout, residence time, instantaneous blood stagnation and a pulsatility index. By introducing fresh blood to displace pre-existing blood in the LV, after 5 cardiac cycles, 46.7%, 45.7%, 45.1% and 41.8% of pre-existing blood remained for insertion lengths of 5, 19, 24 and 50 mm, respectively. Compared to the 50 mm insertion, blood residence time was at least 9%, 7% and 6% higher with the 5, 19 and 24 mm insertion lengths, respectively. No instantaneous stagnation at the apex was observed directly after the E-wave. Pulsatility indices adjacent to the cannula increased with shorter insertion lengths. For the specific scenario studied, a longer insertion length, relative to LV size, may be advantageous to minimise thrombosis by increasing LV washout and reducing blood residence time.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Subjects performed a quasi-static lunge while micro-dose radiation bi-planar X-rays (EOS Imaging, Paris, France) were captured at roughly 0°, 20°, 45°, 60°, and 90° of tibiofemoral flexion. Joint translations and rotations were extracted from this experimental data through 2D-to-3D bone reconstructions, using an iterative closest point optimization technique, and employed during model calibration and validation. Subject-specific moving-axis and hinge models for comparisons were constructed in the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-extracted anatomical surfaces and compared against the experimental data. The tibiofemoral axis of the hinge model was defined between the epicondyles while the moving-axis model was defined based on two tibiofemoral flexion angles (0° and 90°) and the articulation modeled such that the tibiofemoral joint axis moved linearly between these two positions as a function of the tibiofemoral flexion. Outside this range, the joint axis was assumed to remain stationary. Overall, the secondary joint kinematics (ML: medial-lateral, AP: anterior-posterior, SI: superior-inferior, IE: internal-external, AA: adduction-abduction) were better approximated by the moving-axis model with mean differences and standard errors of (ML: -1.98 ± 0.37 mm, AP: 6.50 ± 0.82 mm, SI: 0.05 ± 0.20 mm, IE: 0.59 ± 0.36°, AA: 1.90 ± 0.79°) and higher coefficients of determination (R2) for each clinical measure.

The objective of this study was to determine and compare the reliability of the existing Kinect-based methods to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters in healthy and post-stroke adults. Forty-five healthy individuals and thirty-eight stroke survivors participated in this study. Participants walked five meters at a comfortable speed and their spatiotemporal gait parameters were estimated from the data retrieved by a Kinect v2, using the most common methods in the literature, and by visual inspection of the videotaped performance. Errors between both estimations were computed. For both healthy and post-stroke participants, highest accuracy was obtained when using the speed of the ankles to estimate gait speed (3.6-5.5 cm/s), stride length (2.5-5.5 cm), and stride time (about 45 ms), and when using the distance between the sacrum and the ankles and toes to estimate double support time (about 65 ms) and swing time (60-90 ms).

OBJECTIVES
determine role of age, disc area, and trabecular bone density on tolerances/risk curves under vertical loading from a controlled group of specimens. T12-S1 columns were obtained, pretest X-rays and CTs taken, load cells attached to both ends, impacts applied at S1-end using custom vertical accelerator device, and posttest X-ray, CT, and dissections done. BMD of L2-L4 vertebrae were obtained from QCT. Survival analysis-based Human Injury Probability Curves (HIPCs) were derived using proximal and distal forces. Age, area, and BMD were covariates. Forces were considered uncensored, representing the load carrying capacity. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to determine optimal distributions. The mean forces, ±95% confidence intervals, and Normalized Confidence Interval Size (NCIS) were computed. The Lognormal distribution was the optimal function for both forces. Age, area, and BMD were not significant (p > 0.05) covariates for distal forces, while only BMD was significant for proximal forces. The NCIS was the lowest for force-BMD covariate HIPC. The HIPCs for both genders at 35 and 45 years were based on population BMDs. These HIPCs serve as human tolerance criteria for automotive, military, and other applications.

In particular, unraveling the mechanisms of formation of the thin film of bolus coating the pharyngeal mucosa after the ingestion of liquid or semi-liquid food products is an important challenge, with implication in dysphagia treatment and sensory perceptions. The aim here is to propose an original experimental model of swallowing (i) to simulate the peristaltic motions driving the bolus from the oral cavity to the esophagus, (ii) to mimic and vary complex physiological variables of the pharyngeal mucosa (lubrication, deformability and velocity) and (iii) to measure the thickness and the composition of the coatings resulting from bolus flow. Three Newtonian glucose solutions were considered as model food boli, through sets of experiments covering different ranges of each physiological parameter mimicked. The properties of the coatings (thickness and dilution in saliva film) were shown to depend significantly on the physical properties of food products considered (viscosity and density), but also on physiological variables such as lubrication by saliva, velocity of the peristaltic wave, and to a lesser extent, the deformability of the pharyngeal mucosa.

For the study, thirteen elite cyclists (VO2max: 71.4 ± 8.0 ml·min-1·kg-1) performed, in a randomised order, three sets of exercises. Each set comprised 2 min of exercise, alternating every 30 s between seated and standing postures, using different slopes and intensity levels on a motorised treadmill. MC was calculated from the measurement of power output and speed, whereas EC was calculated from the measurement of oxygen consumption and speed. MC was significantly higher (+4.3%, p < 0.001) in standing position compared to seated position when all slopes and intensities were considered. However, EC was not significantly affected by the change in position. The standing position also induced a significant increase in rolling resistance power (p < 0.001), rolling resistance coefficient (p < 0.001) and lateral sways (p < 0.001). The significant increase in MC observed in standing position was due to a higher rolling resistance induced by bicycle sways and a shift forward of the centre of mass compared to seated position. This result should lead bicycle tire manufacturers to reduce the increase in rolling resistance between the two positions. Considering the relationship observed between the MC and bicycle sways, cyclists would be well advised to decrease the bicycle sways in order to reduce the MC of locomotion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite it having been used for several decades, the non-union rate remains high. A failed fusion is frequently attributed to an inadequate mechanical environment after instrumentation. Finite element (FE) models can provide insights into the mechanics of the fusion process. Previous fusion simulations using FE models showed that the geometries and material of the cage can greatly influence the fusion outcome. However, these studies used axisymmetric models which lacked realistic spinal geometries. Therefore, different modeling approaches were evaluated to understand the bone-formation process. Three FE models of the lumbar motion segment (L4-L5) were developed: 2D, Sym-3D and Nonsym-3D. The fusion process based on existing mechano-regulation algorithms using the FE simulations to evaluate the mechanical environment was then integrated into these models. In addition, the influence of different lordotic angles (5, 10 and 15°) was investigated. The volume of newly formed bone, the axial stiffness of the whole segment and bone distribution inside and surrounding the cage were evaluated. In contrast to the Nonsym-3D, the 2D and Sym-3D models predicted excessive bone formation prior to bridging (peak values with 36 and 9% higher than in equilibrium, respectively). The 3D models predicted a more uniform bone distribution compared to the 2D model.

This paper thus aims to examine this issue via the molecular structural mechanics (MSM) simulations. The transition of buckling responses was captured as the two-dimensional-linkers were replaced by the three-dimensional (3D) ones. Then, the effects of the radial orientation and the axial density of the 3D-linkers were examined, showing that more uniform distribution of the radial orientation leads to the higher critical load with 3D buckling modes, while the inhomogeneity of the axial density results in the localized buckling patterns. The results demonstrated the important role of the cross-linker in regulating MT stiffness, revealed the physics of the experimentally observed localized buckling and these results will pave the way to a new multi-component mechanics model for whole cells.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The not infrequent incidence of dissection at aortic diameters <5.5 cm, the current threshold guideline for surgical intervention (Nishimura et al., 2014), indicates an unmet need for improved evidence-based risk stratification metrics. Meeting this need requires a fundamental understanding of the structural mechanisms responsible for dissection evolution within the vessel wall. We present a structural model of the repeating lamellar structure of the aortic media comprised of elastic lamellae and collagen fiber networks, the primary load-bearing components of the vessel wall. This model was used to assess the role of these structural features in determining in-plane tissue strength, which governs dissection initiation from an intimal tear. Ascending aortic tissue specimens from three clinically-relevant patient populations were considered: non-aneurysmal aorta from patients with morphologically normal tricuspid aortic valve (CTRL), aneurysmal aorta from patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and aneurysmal aorta from patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Multiphoton imaging derived collagen fiber organization for each patient cohort was explicitly incorporated in our model. Model parameters were calibrated using experimentally-measured uniaxial tensile strength data in the circumferential direction for each cohort, while the model was validated by contrasting simulated tissue strength against experimentally-measured strength in the longitudinal direction. Orientation distribution, controlling the fraction of loaded collagen fibers at a given stretch, was identified as a key feature governing anisotropic tissue strength for all patient cohorts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Kinematics were recorded from 26 adult rats during walking at 8 m/min, 12 m/min and 16 m/min on two separate days. Stride length, stride time, contact time, swing time and hip, knee and ankle joint range of motion were extracted from 15 strides. The relative reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC(1,1)) and (ICC(3,1)). The absolute reliability was determined using measurement error (ME). Across walking speeds, the relative reliability ranged from fair to good (ICCs between 0.4 and 0.75). The ME was below 91 mm for strides lengths, below 55 ms for the temporal stride variables and below 6.4° for the joint angle range of motion. In general, the results indicated an acceptable day-to-day reliability of the gait pattern parameters observed in rats during treadmill walking.

Joint angles are commonly obtained via motion capture, tracking markers placed on anatomical landmarks. This method is associated with limitations including administrative burden, soft tissue artifacts, and intra- and inter-tester variability. An alternative method involves the tracking of rigid marker clusters affixed to body segments, calibrated relative to anatomical landmarks or known joint angles. The accuracy and reliability of applying this cluster method to the upper body has, however, not been comprehensively explored. Our objective was to compare three different upper body cluster models with an anatomical model, with respect to joint angles and reliability. Non-disabled participants performed two standardized functional upper limb tasks with anatomical and cluster markers applied concurrently. Joint angle curves obtained via the marker clusters with three different calibration methods were compared to those from an anatomical model, and between-session reliability was assessed for all models. The cluster models produced joint angle curves which were comparable to and highly correlated with those from the anatomical model, but exhibited notable offsets and differences in sensitivity for some degrees of freedom. Between-session reliability was comparable between all models, and good for most degrees of freedom. Overall, the cluster models produced reliable joint angles that, however, cannot be used interchangeably with anatomical model outputs to calculate kinematic metrics.

Significant relations were found between the parameters of the ramp-and-hold lip force task and target force level, including the peak rate of force change (dF/dtmax), peak force, and the criterion percentage of force within ±5% of target during the contraction hold phase. A significant performance advantage was found among these force variables for the thumb-index finger over the lower lip. The maximum voluntary compression force (MVCF) task revealed highly significant differences in force output between the thumb-index fingers and lower lip (∼4.47-4.70 times greater for the digits versus lower lip), a significant advantage of the right thumb-index finger over the non-dominant left thumb-index finger (12% and 25% right hand advantage for males and females, respectively), and a significant sex difference (∼1.65-1.73 times greater among males).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Cartilage failure may be further complicated by rate-dependent and depth-dependent properties, including the compliant surface layer. Existing blunt impact methods do not resolve local cartilage inhomogeneities and traditional fracture mechanics tests induce crack blunting and may violate underlying assumptions of linear elasticity. To address this knowledge gap, we developed and applied a method to indent cartilage explants with a sharp blade and initiate damage across a range of loading rates (strain rates 0.5%/s-500%/s), while recording local sample deformation and strain energy fields using confocal elastography. To investigate the importance of cartilage's compliant surface, we repeated the experiment for samples with the surface removed. Bulk data suggest a critical force at which the tissue cuts, but local strains reveals that the deformation the sample can sustain before reaching this force is significantly higher in the surface layer. Bulk and local results also showed significant rate dependence, such that samples were easier to cut at faster speeds. This result highlights the importance of rate for understanding cracks in cartilage and parallels recent studies of rate-dependent failure in hydrogels. Notably, local sample deformation fields were well fit by classical Hookean elasticity. Overall, this study illustrates how local and global measurements surrounding the initiation of damage in articular cartilage can be combined to reveal the importance of cartilage's zonal structure in protecting against failure across physiologically relevant loading rates.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The tackle height law is an area of controversy. However, little is known about the effects of repetitive inertial head loading in rugby. Furthermore, the magnitude and influencing factors for head kinematics are generally unknown. In this exploratory study, 45 multibody front-on shoulder tackles simulated with the MADYMO pedestrian model and 20 staged rugby tackles executed by professional rugby players in a marker-based 3D motion laboratory were used to assess the effect of tackle height on ball carrier head kinematics. The peak resultant head linear accelerations, angular accelerations and change in angular velocities were measured and examined. The results suggest that tackle height strongly affects the head kinematics experienced by the ball carrier. In particular, higher ball carrier head kinematic values were identified for upper trunk tackles compared to mid/lower trunk tackles in both the multibody simulations and the staged rugby tackles. Average ball carrier peak resultant head linear acceleration, angular acceleration and change in angular velocity values for upper trunk tackles were greater than for mid/lower trunk tackles by a factor of 1.5, 2.5 and 1.7, in the multibody simulations, respectively, and 1.8 (p = 0.102), 2.2 (p = 0.025) and 2.3 (p = 0.004), in the staged tackles, respectively.

For example, owing to the size and weight of low-frequency force transducers, most currently available wearable gait measurement systems provide only limited, if any, elements of ground reaction force (GRF) data. To obtain the most GRF information possible with a minimal use of sensors, we propose a GRF estimation method based on biomechanical knowledge of human walking. This includes the dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) during steady human gait resembling the oscillatory behaviors of a mass-spring system. Available measurement data were incorporated into a spring-loaded inverted pendulum with translating pivot. The spring stiffness and simulation parameters were tuned to match, as accurately as possible, the available data and oscillatory characteristics of walking. Our results showed that the model simulation estimated reasonably well the unmeasured GRF. Using the vertical GRF and CoP profile for gait speeds ranging from 0.93 to 1.89 m/s, the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF was estimated and resulted in an average correlation coefficient of R = 0.982 ± 0.009. Even when the ground contact timing and gait speed information were alone available, our method estimated GRFs resulting in R = 0.969 ± 0.022 for the A-P and R = 0.891 ± 0.101 for the vertical GRFs.

One promising alternative to traditional, or computationally intensive methods is the symbolic motion structure representation algorithm (SMSR), which identifies the basic spatial-temporal structure of joint angle data using string descriptors of temporal joint angle trajectories. This study attempted to use the SMSR to identify changes in upper extremity time series joint angle data during a repetitive goal directed task causing muscle fatigue. Twenty-eight participants (15 M, 13 F) performed a seated repetitive task until fatigued. Upper extremity joint angles were extracted from motion capture for representative task cycles. SMSRs, averages and ranges of several joint angles were compared at the start and end of the repetitive task to identify kinematic changes with fatigue. At the group level, significant increases in the range of all joint angle data existed with large between-subject variability that posed a challenge to the interpretation of these fatigue-related changes. However, changes in the SMSRs across participants effectively summarized the adoption of adaptive movement strategies. This establishes SMSR as a viable, logical, and sensitive method of fatigue identification via kinematic changes, with novel application and pragmatism for visual assessment of fatigue development.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This work quantitatively characterizes temporal-spatial reach in typically-developing (TD) and very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm toddlers, who are at increased risk of motor impairment. 47 children born VLBW (<1500 g birth-weight; ≤32 weeks gestation) and 22 TD children completed a reaching assessment at 18-22 months of age, adjusted for prematurity. Inertial sensors containing accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers were fixed to toddlers' wrists while they reached for a cube. Reach time, path length, velocity at contact, peak velocity magnitude and timing, acceleration at contact, and peak acceleration were derived from inertial-sensor and high-speed video data. Preterm children also received the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-3rd Edition (BSID-III). Compared to TD toddlers, preterm toddlers had significantly different reach path length, velocity at contact, peak velocity magnitude and timing, acceleration at contact, and peak acceleration. Among preterm toddlers, decreased reach time (rho = -.346, p = .018), decreased time to peak velocity (r = -.390, p = .007), and increased peak acceleration (r = .298, p = .044) correlated to higher BSID-III fine motor scores.

The formation of such abnormal deposits, which further weakens the tissue, suggests that resident tendon cells acquire an aberrant phenotype in response to fatigue damage and the resulting altered mechanical microenvironment. While fatigue loading produces clear changes in collagen organization and molecular denaturation, no data exist regarding the effect of fatigue on the local tissue mechanical properties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify changes in the local tissue stiffness of tendons after fatigue loading. We hypothesized that fatigue damage would reduce local tissue stiffness, particularly in areas with significant structural damage (e.g., collagen denaturation). We tested this hypothesis by identifying regions of local fatigue damage (i.e., collagen fiber kinking and molecular denaturation) via histologic imaging and by measuring the local tissue modulus within these regions via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Counter to our initial hypothesis, we found no change in the local tissue modulus as a consequence of fatigue loading, despite widespread fiber kinking and collagen denaturation. These data suggest that immediate changes in topography and tissue structure - but not local tissue mechanics - initiate the early changes in tendon cell phenotype as a consequence of fatigue loading that ultimately culminate in tendon degeneration.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The two-phase treatment relies on the production of a vascularized foreign-body membrane to support bone grafts over three times larger than the traditional maximum. Historically, the procedure has always utilized a bone cement spacer to evoke membrane production. However, membrane formation can easily be effected by implant surface properties such as material and topology. This study sought to determine if the membrane's mechanical or barrier properties are affected by changing the spacer material to titanium or roughening the surface finish. Ten-week-old, male Sprague Dawley rats were given an externally stabilized, 6 mm femur defect which was filled with a pre-made spacer of bone cement (PMMA) or titanium (TI) with a smooth (∼1 μm) or roughened (∼8 μm) finish. After 4 weeks of implantation, the membranes were harvested, and the matrix composition, tensile mechanics, shrinkage, and barrier function was assessed. Roughening the spacers resulted in significantly more compliant membranes. TI spacers created membranes that inhibited solute transport more. There were no differences between groups in collagen or elastin distribution. This suggests that different membrane characteristics can be created by altering the spacer surface properties.

Purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of the crutch setup on upper limbs biomechanics, including shoulder joint kinematics and kinetics parameters that will be evaluated to detect possible differences related to the crutch length. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to elbow flexed (EF) or elbow extended (EE) forearm crutch setup. Subjects were asked to walk on the laboratory path, instrumented with motion tracking system and force platforms. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, crutch ground reaction force (GRF) and crutch displacement (measured as the relative distance between the crutch position on the floor and the shoulder joint center), were evaluated. A three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical model was implemented to determine shoulder joint kinematics and kinetics during crutch walking. Results showed that the stride length significantly decreased, and base of support width increased for the EF group when compared to the EE group. Crutch forces and distance to the body significantly decreased in the EE group. Furthermore, shoulder joint moments in all planes of motion, vertical and lateral forces were significantly reduced in the EE group.

This study aimed to quantify shoulder muscle and joint force during assisted activities of daily living using a powered robotic upper limb exoskeleton (ArmeoPower, Hocoma). Six healthy male subjects performed abduction, flexion, horizontal flexion, reaching and nose touching activities. These tasks were repeated under two conditions: (i) the exoskeleton compensating only for its own weight, and (ii) the exoskeleton providing full upper limb gravity compensation (i.e., weightlessness). Muscle EMG, joint kinematics and joint torques were simultaneously recorded, and shoulder muscle and joint forces calculated using personalized musculoskeletal models of each subject's upper limb. The exoskeleton reduced peak joint torques, muscle forces and joint loading by up to 74.8% (0.113 Nm/kg), 88.8% (5.8%BW) and 68.4% (75.6%BW), respectively, with the degree of load attenuation strongly task dependent.

The present study showed that upper limb weight compensation using an assistive exoskeleton may increase glenohumeral joint stability, since deltoid muscle force, which is the primary contributor to superior glenohumeral joint shear, is attenuated; however, prominent exoskeleton interaction moments are required to position and control the upper limb in space, even under full gravity compensation conditions.

We present an observation-adjusted ROC (oaROC) which uses the survival-based IRC to estimate the AROC. We verified and evaluated this method using simulated datasets of different censoring statuses and sample sizes. For a dataset with 1000 left and right censored observations, the median AROC closely approached the oaROCTrue, or the oaROC calculated using an assumed ""true"" IRC, differing by a fraction of a percent, 0.1%. Using simulated datasets with various censoring, we found that oaROC converged onto oaROCTrue in all cases. For datasets with right and non-censored observations, AROC did not converge onto oaROCTrue. oaROC for datasets with only non-censored observations converged the fastest, and for a dataset with 10 observations, the median oaROC differed from oaROCTrue by 2.74% while the corresponding median AROC with left and right censored data differed from oaROCTrue by 9.74%. We also calculated the AROC and oaROC for a published side impact dataset, and differences between the two methods ranged between -24.08% and 24.55% depending on metric. Overall, when compared with AROC, we found oaROC performs equivalently for doubly censored data, better for non-censored data, and can accommodate more types of data than AROC.

Two groups (training vs. control) of healthy young participants were respectively exposed to a treadmill-based stance-slip perturbation training protocol and a placebo training protocol. Post training, both groups experienced an unexpected overground gait-slip. Our results indicated that 28.6% of individuals in the training group and 55.0% of controls fell when responding to the overground slip. In comparison with the control group, the training group exhibited better control over the compensatory step and dynamic stability at the instant immediately prior to recovery touchdown. The improved dynamic stability control in the training group likely resulted from the enhanced capability of harnessing the slip kinematics of the base of support. Dynamic stability did not display any significant group-associated difference at slipping foot touchdown and recovery foot liftoff. This implies that a stance-slip perturbation training protocol with eight slips may not provide enough and very task-specific incentive to the Central Nervous System to form the capability of sufficiently modifying regular gait pattern after an unexpected gait slip. However, given its ease of use, stance-perturbation could be a practical option to train individuals in clinical settings as a simple push or pull could exert a perturbation to a standing individual. The findings from this study provide information for developing future studies based on large-scale samples.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It entails complex interactions between adjacent cells and between cells-extracellular matrices. Most studies measure the migration patterns and force propagation by placing cells on flat, patterned substrates. The cooperative behavior resulting from cell-cell interactions is not well understood. We have developed a multi-channel microfluidic device that has junctional protein E-cadherin coated onto the sidewalls of the channels that enables the cells' lateral interactions with their neighbors to be studied. Our study reveals that epithelial cells rely on lateral E-cadherin-based adhesions to maintain the cohesion of the group. Cells move faster in narrower channels, but the average velocity along the channels is reduced in E-cadherin coated channels versus non-adhesive channels. We have directly measured the forces in the cross-linking protein, alpha-actinin, using FRET sensors during cell migration, and found that higher tension exists at the cell edges adjacent to the walls coated with E-cadherin, the implication being E-cadherin transmits the shear forces but does not provide a driving force for this migration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Potentially, such models could be used to aid the clinical decision-making process for percutaneous valve selection; however, their adoption in clinical practice is still limited to individual cases. To be fully informative, they should include patient-specific data on both anatomy and mechanics of the implantation site. In this work, fourteen patient-specific computational models for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with balloon-expandable Sapien XT devices were retrospectively developed to tune the material parameters of the implantation site mechanical model for the average TAVR population. Pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) images were post-processed to create the 3D patient-specific anatomy of the implantation site. Balloon valvuloplasty and device deployment were simulated with finite element (FE) analysis. Valve leaflets and aortic root were modelled as linear elastic materials, while calcification as elastoplastic. Material properties were initially selected from literature; then, a statistical analysis was designed to investigate the effect of each implantation site material parameter on the implanted stent diameter and thus identify the combination of material parameters for TAVR patients. These numerical models were validated against clinical data. The comparison between stent diameters measured from post-procedural fluoroscopy images and final computational results showed a mean difference of 2.5 ± 3.9%. Moreover, the numerical model detected the presence of paravalvular leakage (PVL) in 79% of cases, as assessed by post-TAVR echocardiographic examination. The final aim was to increase accuracy and reliability of such computational tools for prospective clinical applications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, no method for assessing segmental excursion of the lower limb during single limb stance (SLS) with wearable technology has been described in the literature nor has its clinical meaning been explored. This study introduces a clinically friendly measure to quantify lower limb segmental excursion during SLS with inertial measurement units (IMUs) which called the region of limb stability (ROLS). The purpose of this study was to determine the concurrent validity of an IMU-based system versus an optical motion capture system and to determine the effects of knee injury on the ROLS value. Excursion areas of five healthy adults were calculated with the IMU-based system and data were compared with an optical motion capture system. There were high correlations (0.82-0.93) and no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the tested parameters between the optical- and IMU-based systems. The IMU-based method was also implemented in five Division I athletes with knee injuries to determine changes in ROLS due to the injury. The ROLS Symmetry Index value offered a higher sensitivity and specificity to assess the presence of knee impairment than the sacral IMU. Quantified lower limb segmental excursion via IMUs can make better and more precise return-to-sport decisions that would decrease the risk of re-injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In football kicking, conflicting and non-significant results have existed between reducing ankle plantarflexion during foot-ball contact with impact efficiency, making it unclear as to its importance as a coaching instruction. The aims of this study were to first validate a mechanical kicking machine with a non-rigid ankle, and secondly compare a rigid to a non-rigid ankle during the impact phase of football kicking. Measures of foot-ball contact for ten trials per ankle configuration were calculated from data recorded at 4000 Hz and compared. The non-rigid ankle was characterised by initial dorsiflexion followed by plantarflexion for the remainder of impact, and based on similarities to punt and instep kicking, was considered valid. Impact efficiency (foot-to-ball speed ratio) was greater for the rigid ankle (rigid = 1.16 ± 0.02; non-rigid = 1.10 ± 0.01; p < 0.001). The rigid ankle was characterised by significantly greater effective mass and significantly less energy losses. Increasing rigidity allowed a greater portion of mass from the shank to be used during the collision. As the ankle remained in plantarflexion at impact end, stored elastic energy was not converted to ball velocity and was considered lost. Increasing rigidity is beneficial for increasing impact efficiency, and therefore ball velocity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Their functioning, either as a paddle or a sieve, depends on the leakiness, or amount of fluid that passes through the gaps between the appendages. Balanus glandula is the most common species of barnacle distributed along the Pacific coast of North America. It shows a strong phenotypic response to water flow velocity. Individuals from exposed, high flow sites have short and robust cirral filters, whereas those from sheltered, low velocity sites have long, spindly appendages. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of these two ecophenotypes were done using a finite volume method. Leakiness was determined by simulating flow velocity fields at increasing Reynolds numbers, results that have been unattainable at higher velocities by observation. CFD also allowed us to characterize flow in hard to see regions of the feeding legs (rami). Laser-illumination experiments were performed at low to medium flow velocities in a flume tank and corroborated results from CFD. Barnacle filters from a sheltered site become completely leaky at Re=2.24(0.16m/s), well above the maximum habitat velocity, suggesting that this ecophenotype is not mechanically optimized for feeding. Barnacles from exposed environments become fully leaky within the range of habitat velocities Re=3.50(0.18m/s). Our CFD results revealed that the drag force on exposed barnacles feeding appendages are the same as the sheltered barnacles feeding appendages despite their shape difference and spacing ratio.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous investigators have used custom-built biplane fluoroscopes designed specifically for kinematic applications, which are available at few institutions and require FDA approval prior to clinical use. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of an off-the-shelf clinical biplane fluoroscope for kinematic applications by validating model-based tracking for measurement of glenohumeral motion using an unmodified clinical system. Biplane images of each shoulder of a cadaver torso were acquired at various joint positions and during simulated movements along anatomical planes of motion. The pose of each humerus and scapula was determined using model-based tracking and compared to a bead-based gold standard. Error due to a temporal-offset between corresponding biplane images, characteristic of clinical biplane systems, was determined by comparison of measured and known relative position of 2 bead clusters of a phantom that was imaged while moved throughout the fluoroscopy image volume. Model-based tracking had global kinematic mean absolute errors of 0.27 mm and 0.29° (static), and 0.22-0.32 mm and 0.12-0.45° (dynamic). Glenohumeral mean absolute errors were 0.39 mm and 0.45° (static), and 0.36-0.42 mm and 0.41-0.48° (dynamic). The temporal-offset was predicted to add errors of 0.06-0.85 mm and 0.05-0.28° for cadaveric trials for the speeds examined.

The objective of this study was to develop a method of tracking internal and surface deformation of in vivo rat spinal cord during compression using radiography. Since neural tissue is radio-translucent, radio-opaque markers were injected into the spinal cord. Two tantalum beads (260 µm) were injected into the cord (dorsal and ventral) at C5 of nine anesthetized rats. Four beads were glued to the lateral surface of the cord, caudal and cranial to the injection site. A compression plate was displaced 0.5 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm into the spinal cord and lateral X-ray images were taken before, during, and after each compression for measuring bead displacements. Potential bead migration was monitored for by comparing displacements of the internal and glued surface beads. Dorsal beads moved significantly more than ventral beads with a range in averages of 0.57-0.71 mm and 0.31-0.35 mm respectively. Bead displacements during 0.5 mm compressions were significantly lower than 2 mm and 3 mm compressions. There was no statistically significant migration of the internal beads. The results indicate the merit of this technique for measuring in vivo spinal cord deformation. The pattern of bead displacements illustrates the complex internal and surface deformations of the spinal cord during transverse compression. This information is needed for validating physical and finite element spinal cord surrogates and to define relationships between loading parameters, internal cord deformation, and biological and functional outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The integration of this functionality into implant surfaces could mitigate excessive fibrotic responses to many biomedical devices. By changing the profiles of the AC magnetic field, the amplitude, duration, and period of the applied vibrations was altered to understand the effect of each parameter on cell behavior. Results indicate fibroblast adhesion depends on the magnitude and total number of applied vibrations, and reductions in proliferative activity, cell spreading, and the expression of myofibroblastic markers occur in response to the vibrations induced by the ME materials.

Tongue as a combination of various muscles is surrounded by the mucous membrane and is a complicated architecture to study. As a first step before the quantitative mechanical characterization of human tongue tissues, the passive biomechanical properties in the superior longitudinal muscle (SLM) and the mucous tissues of a bovine tongue have been measured. Since the rate of loading has a sizeable contribution to the resultant stress of soft tissues, the rate dependent behavior of tongue tissues has been investigated via uniaxial tension tests (UTTs). A method to determine the mechanical properties of transversely isotropic tissues using UTTs and inverse finite element (FE) method has been proposed. Assuming the strain energy as a general nonlinear relationship with respect to the stretch and the rate of stretch, two visco-hyperelastic constitutive laws (CLs) have been proposed for isotropic and transversely isotropic soft tissues to model their stress-stretch behavior. Both of them have been implemented in ABAQUS explicit through coding a user-defined material subroutine called VUMAT and the experimental stress-stretch points have been well tracked by the results of FE analyses. It has been demonstrated that the proposed laws make a good description of the viscous nature of tongue tissues. Reliability of the proposed models has been compared with similar nonlinear visco-hyperelastic CLs.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims to examine the validity of time series kinematical data as measured by the Kinect v2 on a flatland for gait assessment. In this study, 51 healthy subjects walked on a flatland while kinematic data were extracted concurrently using the Kinect and Vicon systems. The kinematic outcomes comprised the hip and knee joint angles. Parallel translation of Kinect data obtained throughout the gait cycle was performed to minimize the differences between the Kinect and Vicon data. The ensemble curves of the hip and knee joint angles were compared to investigate whether the Kinect sensor can consistently and accurately assess lower extremity joint motion throughout the gait cycle. Relative consistency was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Joint angles measured by the Kinect v2 followed the trend of the trajectories made by the Vicon data in both the hip and knee joints in the sagittal plane. The trajectories of the hip and knee joint angles in the frontal plane differed between the Kinect and Vicon data. We observed moderate to high correlation coefficients of 20%-60% of the gait cycle, and the largest difference between Kinect and Vicon data was 4.2°.

However, there is little understanding of how various lower limb configurations influence the ability to maintain force. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the influence of joint angle on various lower-limb constant force contractions. Nineteen adults performed knee extension, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion isometric force contractions to 11 target forces, ranging from 2 to 95% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) at 2 angles. Force variability was quantified with mean force, standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation of force output. Non-linearities in force output were quantified with approximate entropy. Curve fitting analyses were performed on each set of data from each individual across contractions to further examine whether joint angle interacts with global functions of lower-limb force variability. Joint angle had significant effects on the model parameters used to describe the force-variability function for each muscle contraction (p < 0.05). Regularities in force output were more explained by force level in smaller angle conditions relative to the larger angle conditions (p < 0.05).

Encouraging or coaching recreational runners to increase their running speed to derive these health benefits might be more effective if their joint level kinematic and kinetic strategy was understood. The aim of this investigation was to compare the peak sagittal plane motions, moments, and powers of the hip, knee and ankle at 85%, 100%, 115% and 130% of self-selected running speed. Overground running data were collected in 12 recreational runners (6 women, 6 men) with a full body marker set using a 12-camera Vicon MX system with an AMTI force plate.

The present study investigated the effects of tracking landmark position and tibial point of resistive force application during leg extensions in a dynamometer. Nineteen adults performed isometric contractions with a proximal and distal dynamometer shank pad position. Knee joint moments were calculated employing an inverse dynamics approach. Tendon elongation was measured using the patellar apex and either the tibial tuberosity (T) or plateau (P) as tracking landmark. Using P for tracking introduced a bias towards greater values of tendon elongation at all force levels from 100 N to maximum tendon force (TFmax; p < 0.05). The differences between landmarks considering maximum tendon strain were greater at the proximal shank pad position (p < 0.05). Tendon stiffness was lower for P compared with T, but only in intervals up to 50% of TFmax (p < 0.05). The agreement between T and P for stiffness calculated between 50% and TFmax was acceptable with the distal, but poor with the proximal pad position. We demonstrated that using the tibia plateau and not the insertion as tracking landmark clearly affects the assessment of the force-elongation curve of the patellar tendon. However, using a distal point of resistive force application and calculating tendon stiffness between 50% and TFmax seems to yield an acceptable agreement between landmarks.

However, to date there is no way of tracking balance through center of mass motion because no method is available to identify of the body center of mass throughout pregnancy. We compared methods for determining segment masses and torso center of mass location. The availability of a method for tracking these changes during pregnancy will make determining balance changes through center of mass motion an option for future pregnancy balance research. Thirty pregnant women from eight weeks gestation until birth were recruited for monthly anthropometric measurements, motion capture analysis of body segment locations, and force plate analysis of center of pressure during quiet standing and supine laying. From these measurements, we were able to compare regression, volume measurement, and weighted sum methods to calculate body center of mass throughout pregnancy. We found that mass changes around the trunk were most prevalent as expected, but mass changes throughout the body (especially the thighs) were also seen. Our findings also suggest that a series of anthropometric measurements first suggested by Pavol et al.

However, many studies have used systems based on multiple sensors or have only focused on estimating SL for walking. Here we test the concurrent validity of a single foot-mounted, 9-degree of freedom IMU to estimate SL for running. We employed a running-specific, Kalman filter based zero-velocity update (ZUPT) algorithm to calculate individual SL vectors with the IMU and compared the results to SLs that were simultaneously recorded by a 6-camera 3D motion capture system. The results showed that the analytical procedures were able to successfully identify all strides that were recorded by the camera system and that excellent levels of absolute agreement (ICC(3,1) = 0.955) existed between the two methods.

Moreover, on the way to the oviduct, a change in sperm motility called hyperactivation may occur. In the present study, we focused on the motion characteristics of hyperactivated bovine sperm and investigated the effect of the surrounding fluid on motility. We prepared two kinds of polyacrylamide with high-viscosity non-Newtonian fluid properties, similar to the actual cervical and oviductal mucus. Using semen from Japanese cattle, we evaluated curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), and average path velocity (VAP). Additionally, we estimated linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), and wobble (WOB) as sperm motility parameters for several surrounding fluids. We successfully induced hyperactivation of bovine sperm in high-viscosity non-Newtonian fluid. Hyperactivation resulted in an increase in VCL and a decrease in VSL. In the high-viscosity non-Newtonian fluid, the hyperactivated sperm moved in a zig-zag pattern with regularity, different from the movement observed in a diluted solution. The increase in WOB in the non-Newtonian fluid suggests that hyperactivated sperm efficiently progress along the groove that exists on the oviductal mucus wall.

The first step to prevent falls is to devise reliable methods to identify individuals at high fall risk. The purpose of the current study was to assess alterations in local postural muscle and central sensory balance control mechanisms due to low-frequency externally applied vibration among elders at high fall risk, in comparison with healthy controls, as a potential tool for assessing fall risk. Three groups of participants were recruited: healthy young (n = 10; age = 23 ± 2 years), healthy elders (n = 10; age = 73 ± 3 years), and elders at high fall risk (n = 10; age = 84 ± 9 years).

When vibratory stimulation was applied, changes in local-control performance manifested significant differences among the groups (p < 0.01). On average between conditions, we observed 97% and 92% less change among high fall risk participants when compared to healthy young and older adults, respectively. On the other hand, vibration-induced changes in the central-control performance were not significant between groups (p ≥ 0.19). Results suggest that local-control deficits are responsible for balance behavior alterations among elders at high fall risk and healthy individuals. This observation may be attributable to deterioration of short-latency reflexive loop in elders at high fall risk.

This study aims to extend the understanding of pediatric spine biomechanics, where there is a paucity of studies available. A newly developed and continuously scalable FE model was validated and scaled to 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 10-, 14- and 18-year-old using a non-linear scaling technique, accounting for local topological changes. The oldest and youngest ages were also scaled using homogeneous geometric scaling. To study the effect of pediatric spinal growth on head kinematics and intervertebral disc strain, the models were exerted to 3.5 g acceleration pulse at the T1 vertebra to simulate frontal, rear and side impacts. It was shown that the head rotation increases with age, but is over predicted when geometrically scaling down from 18- to 1.5-year-old and under predicted when geometrically scaling up from 1.5- to 18-year-old.

In the frontal impact, no clear age dependence could be seen, suggesting a large contribution from changed facet joint angles, and lower levels of strain, suggesting a lower risk of injury.

The discs play an important mechanical role in the spine, yet the relationship between disc function and back pain is poorly defined. The objective of this work was to develop a technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional modeling to measure in vivo disc deformations. Using this method, we found that disc geometry was measurable with precision less than the in-plane dimensions of a voxel (≈100 µm, 10% of the MRI pixel size). Furthermore, there was excellent agreement between mean disc height, disc perimeter, disc volume and regional disc height measurements for multiple trials from an individual rater (standard deviation <3.1% across all measurements) and between mean height, perimeter, and volume measurements made by two independent raters (error <1.5% across all measurements). We then used this measurement system to track diurnal deformations in the L5-S1 disc in a young, healthy population (n = 8; age 24.1 ± 3.3 yrs; 2 M/6F). We measured decreases in the mean disc height (-8%) and volume (-9%) with no changes in perimeter over an eight-hour workday. We found that the largest height losses occurred in the posterior (-13%) and posterior-lateral (-14%) regions adjacent to the outer annulus fibrosus. Diurnal annulus fibrosus (AF) strains induced by posterior and posterior-lateral height loss may increase the risk for posterior disc herniation or posterior AF tears. These preliminary findings lay a foundation for determining how deviations from normal deformations may contribute to back pain.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Due to its simplicity, however, the current form of the SLIP model is limited at providing any further information about multi-segmental lower limbs that generate oscillatory CoM behaviors and their corresponding ground reaction forces. Considering that the dynamics of the CoM are simply achieved by mass-spring mechanics, we wondered whether any of the multi-joint motions could be demonstrated by simple mechanics. In this study, we expand a SLIP model of human locomotion with an off-centered curvy foot connected to the leg by a springy segment that emulates the asymmetric kinematics and kinetics of the ankle joint. The passive dynamics of the proposed expansion of the SLIP model demonstrated the empirical data of ground reaction forces, center of mass trajectories, ankle joint kinematics and corresponding ankle joint torque at various gait speeds. From the mechanically simulated trajectories of the ankle joint and CoM, the motion of lower-limb segments, such as thigh and shank angles, could be estimated from inverse kinematics. The estimation of lower limb kinematics showed a qualitative match with empirical data of walking at various speeds. The representability of passive compliant mechanics for the kinetics of the CoM and ankle joint and lower limb joint kinematics implies that the coordination of multi-joint lower limbs during gait can be understood with a mechanical framework.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The balanced competition between fluid exudation and recovery under load is thus critical to the mechanical and biological functions of the tissue. We recently discovered that sliding alone can induce rapid solute transport into buried cartilage contact areas via a phenomenon termed tribological rehydration. In this study, we use in situ confocal microscopy measurements to track the spatiotemporal propagation of a small neutral solute into the buried contact area to clarify the fluid mechanics underlying the tribological rehydration phenomenon. Sliding experiments were interrupted by periodic static loading to enable scanning of the entire contact area. Spatiotemporal patterns of solute transport combined with tribological data suggested pressure driven flow through the extracellular matrix from the contact periphery rather than into the surface via a fluid film. Interestingly, these testing interruptions also revealed dynamic, repeatable and history-independent fluid loss and recovery processes consistent with those observed in vivo. Unlike the migrating contact area, which preserves hydration by moving faster than interstitial fluid can flow, our results demonstrate that the stationary contact area can maintain and actively recover hydration through a dynamic competition between load-induced exudation and sliding-induced recovery. The results demonstrate that sliding contributes to the recovery of fluid and solutes by cartilage within the contact area while clarifying the means by which it occurs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) are the most common pathologies, which can be associated with changes in the mechanical properties of the supportive structures in the female pelvic cavity. PFD have been studied through different methods, from experimental tensile tests using tissues from fresh female cadavers or tissues collected at the time of a transvaginal hysterectomy procedure, or by applying imaging techniques. In this work, an inverse finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to understand the passive and active behavior of the pubovisceralis muscle (PVM) during Valsalva maneuver and muscle active contraction, respectively. Individual numerical models of women without pathology, with stress UI (SUI) and POP were built based on magnetic resonance images, including the PVM and surrounding structures. The passive and active material parameters obtained for a transversely isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model were estimated for the three groups. The values for the material constants were significantly higher for the women with POP when compared with the other two groups. The PVM of women with POP showed the highest stiffness. Additionally, the influence of these parameters was analyzed by evaluating their stress-strain, and force-displacements responses. The force produced by the PVM in women with POP was 47% and 82% higher when compared to women without pathology and with SUI, respectively.

Stride-based segmentation relies on identifying gait events, a step avoided by using window-based segmentation. For each segment, discrete points can be extracted from the accelerometer signal, or advanced features can be computed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how different segmentation and feature extraction methods influence the accuracy and computational load of classifying running conditions. Forty-four runners ran at their preferred speed and 25% faster than preferred while an accelerometer at the lower back recorded 3D accelerations. Computational load was determined as the accelerometer signal was segmented into single and five strides, and corresponding small and large windows, with discrete points extracted from the single stride segments and advanced features computed from all four segment types. Each feature set was used to classify speed conditions and classification accuracy was recorded. Computational load and classification accuracy were compared across all feature sets using a repeated-measures MANOVA, with follow-up t-tests to compare feature type (discrete vs. advanced), segmentation method (stride- vs. window-based), and segment size (small vs. large), using a Bonferroni-adjusted α = 0.003. The five-stride (97.49 (±4.57)%) and large-window advanced (97.23 (±5.51)%) feature sets produced the greatest classification accuracy, but the large-window advanced feature set had a lower computational load (0.0041 (±0.0002)s) than the stride-based feature sets.

However, current techniques to realistically simulate muscle response when significant amounts of intentional coactivation is required are inadequate. This would include stiffening the neck or spine through muscle coactivation in preparation for perturbations or impacts. Muscle coactivation has been modeled previously in the neck and spine using optimization techniques that seek to maximize the joint stiffness by maximizing total muscle activation or muscle force. These approaches have not sought to replicate human response, but rather to explore the possible effects of active muscle. Coactivation remains a challenging feature to include in musculoskeletal models, and may be improved by extracting optimization objective functions from experimental data. However, the components of such an objective function must be known before fitting to experimental data. This study explores the effect of components in several objective functions, in order to recommend components to be used for fitting to experimental data. Four novel approaches to modeling coactivation through optimization techniques are presented, two of which produce greater levels of stiffness than previous techniques. Simulations were performed using OpenSim and MATLAB cooperatively. Results show that maximizing the moment generated by a particular muscle appears analogous to maximizing joint stiffness. The approach of optimizing for maximum moment generated by individual muscles may be a good candidate for developing objective functions that accurately simulate muscle coactivation in complex joints.

While often unanticipated and lethal, its incidence is low making mechanistic examination difficult through clinical investigation alone. Thus, throughout the technological advancement of these devices, experimental models have been indispensable in furthering our understanding of device safety and efficacy. As we refine model systems to gain deeper insight into adverse events, it is equally important that we continue to refine our measurement methods. We used digital signal processing in an established flow loop model to investigate local flow effects due to geometric stent features and ultimately its relationship to thrombus formation. A new metric of clot distribution on each microCT slice termed normalized clot ratio was defined to quantify this distribution. Three under expanded coronary bare-metal stents were run in a flow loop model to induce clotting. Samples were then scanned in a MicroCT machine and digital signal processing methods applied to analyze geometric stent conformation and spatial clot formation. Results indicated that geometric stent features play a significant role in clotting patterns, specifically at a frequency of 0.6225 Hz corresponding to a geometric distance of 1.606 mm. The magnitude-squared coherence between geometric features and clot distribution was greater than 0.4 in all samples. In stents with poor wall apposition, ranging from 0.27 mm to 0.64 mm maximum malapposition (model of real-world heterogeneity), clots were found to have formed in between stent struts rather than directly adjacent to struts.

Visual analog scale (VAS) pain, the hospital for special surgery knee score (HSS), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle (measured in the frontal plane), and flexion/extension range of motion of the knee were assessed before and up to 6 months after surgery. Patients were evaluated for gait parameters and overall peak knee adduction moment (KAM). Patient-specific finite element knee models were developed to investigate changes in load in response to fibulectomy.

However, both evaluating their mechanical demands on the musculoskeletal system and designing protocols to provide progressive loading are difficult tasks. This study reports for the first time shoulder joint kinetics and dynamics during underwater forward arm elevation performed at speeds ranging from 22.5 to 90°/s. Net joint moments projected onto anatomical axes of rotation, joint power, and joint work were calculated in 18 participants through a novel approach coupling numerical fluid flow simulations and inverse dynamics. Joint dynamics was revealed from the 3D angle between the joint moment and angular velocity vectors, identifying three main functions-propulsion, stabilization, and resistance. Speeds <30°/s necessitated little to no power at all, whereas peaks about 0.20 W⋅kg-1 were seen at 90°/s. As speed increased, peak moments were up to 61 × higher at 90 than at 22.5°/s, (1.82 ± 0.12%BW⋅AL vs 0.03 ± 0.01%BW⋅AL, P < 0.038). This was done at the expense of a substantial decrease in the joint moment contribution to joint stability though, which goes against the intuition that greater stabilization is required to protect the shoulder from increasing loads. Slow arm elevations (<30°/s) are advantageous for joint mobility gain at low mechanical solicitation, whereas the intensity at 90°/s is high enough to stimulate muscular endurance improvements. Simple predictive equations of shoulder mechanical loading are provided.

Changes in foot clearance in people with PD are likely to be associated with temporal-spatial characteristics of gait such as walking slowly which evokes alterations in the temporal-spatial control of stepping patterns. Enhancing our understanding of the temporal-spatial determinants of foot clearance may inform the design of falls prevention therapies. Thirty-six people with PD and 38 age-matched controls completed four intermittent walks under two conditions: self-selected and fast gait velocity. Temporal-spatial characteristics of gait and foot (heel and toe) clearance outcomes were obtained using an instrumented walkway and 3D motion capture, respectively.

Tricuspid valve reconstruction using a small intestinal submucosal porcine extracellular matrix (ECM) tube graft is hypothesized to be durable for six months and show signs of recellularization and growth potential. The purpose was to histologically and biomechanically test ECM valves before and after six months of implantation in pigs for comparison with native valves.


METHODS
Ten 60 kg pigs were included, which survived tricuspid valve tube graft insertion. Anterior and septal tricuspid leaflets were explanted from all animals surviving more than one month and examined histologically (n = 9). Endothelialization, collagen content, mineralization, neovascularization, burst strength and tensile strength were determined for native valves (n = 5), ECM before implantation (n = 5), and ECM after six months (n = 5).


RESULTS
Collagen density was significantly larger in ECM at implantation (baseline) compared to native leaflet tissue (0.3 ± 0.02 mg/mm3 vs. 0.1 ± 0.03 mg/mm3, p < .0001), but collagen density decreased and reached native leaflet collagen content, six months after ECM implantation (native vs. ECM valve at six months: 0.1 ± 0.03 mg/mm3 vs. 0.2 ± 0.05 mg/mm3, p = .8). Histologically, ECM valves showed endothelialization, host cell infiltration and structural collagen organization together with elastin generation after six months, indicating tissue remodeling and -engineering together with gradual development of a close-to-native leaflet structure without foreign body response.

Approximately 348,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed annually in the United States and the incisional hernia recurrence rate is approximately 20% as a result of suture and mesh device failure. Device failure is related to changes at the suture/tissue interface that leads to acute or chronic suture pull-through and surgical failure. To better manage mechanical tension, we propose a modified mesh design with extensions and demonstrate its mechanical superiority.


METHODS
Comparative uniaxial static tensile testing was conducted on polypropylene suture and a modified mesh. Subsequently, a standard of care (SOC) mesh and modified mesh were evaluated using a tensometer in an acute hernia bench-top model.


RESULTS
Modified mesh breaking strength, extension knot breaking strength, extension disruption, and extension anchoring were superior to suture (p < .05). Modified mesh ultimate tensile strength of anchoring was superior to SOC mesh (p < .05). Various stitch patterns and modifications in device design significantly improved device tension-free performance far beyond clinically relevant benchmarks (p < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Testing demonstrates that the modified mesh outperforms SOC mesh and suture in all tested failure modes. SOC hernia mesh tears through tissue at stress levels below maximum physiologic stress, whereas, the modified hernia mesh is up to 200% stronger than SOC mesh at resisting suture tearing through tissue and maintains anchoring at stresses far beyond clinically relevant benchmarks.

Anatomical measures are used to assess the progression of pathologies related to low back pain and to screen patients for surgical treatment options. To describe anatomical norms and pathological differences for the population, statistical shape modeling, which uses full three-dimensional representations of bone morphology and relative alignment, can capture intersubject variability and enable comparative evaluations of subject to population. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive set of three-dimensional statistical models to characterize anatomical variability in the lumbar spine, by specifically describing the shape of individual vertebrae, and shape and alignment of the entire lumbar spine (L1-S1), with a focus on the L4-L5 and L5-S1 functional spinal units (FSU). Using CT scans for a cohort of 52 patients, lumbar spine geometries were registered to a template to establish correspondence and a principal component analysis identified the primary modes of variation. Scaling was the most prevalent mode of variation for all models. Subsequent modes of the statistical shape models of the individual bones characterized shape variation within the processes. Subsequent modes of variation for the FSU and entire spine models described alignment changes associated with disc height and lordosis. Quantification of anatomical variation in the spine with statistical models can inform implant design and sizing, assist clinicians in diagnosing pathologies, screen patients for treatment options, and support pre-operative planning.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To improve work place safety, it is necessary to assess musculoskeletal and biomechanical risk exposures associated with these tasks. Such an assessment has been mainly conducted using surface marker-based methods, which is time consuming and tedious. During the past decade, computer vision based pose estimation techniques have gained an increasing interest and may be a viable alternative for surface marker-based human movement analysis. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a computer vision based marker-less motion capture method to assess 3D joint kinematics of lifting tasks. Twelve subjects performing three types of symmetrical lifting tasks were filmed from two views using optical cameras. The joints kinematics were calculated by the proposed computer vision based motion capture method as well as a surface marker-based motion capture method. The joint kinematics estimated from the computer vision based method were practically comparable to the joint kinematics obtained by the surface marker-based method. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between the joint angles estimated by the computer vision based method and these obtained by the surface marker-based method was 2.31 ± 4.00°. One potential application of the proposed computer vision based marker-less method is to noninvasively assess 3D joint kinematics of industrial tasks such as lifting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The study relies on clinician indications to define kinematic features, that describe five motor tasks (i.e., the lateral tilt of the trunk, lifting of the arms, trunk rotation, pelvis rotation, squatting) usually adopted in the rehabilitation program for axial disorders. These features are extracted by the Kinect v2 skeleton tracking system and elaborated to return disaggregated scores, representing a measure of subjects performance. A bell-shaped function is used to rank the patient performances and to provide the scores. The proposed rehabilitation tool has been tested on 28 healthy subjects and on 29 patients suffering from different neurological and orthopedic diseases. The reliability of the study has been performed through a cross-sectional controlled design methodology, comparing algorithm scores with respect to blinded judgment provided by clinicians through filling a specific questionnaire. The use of task-specific features and the comparison between the clinical evaluation and the score provided by the instrumental approach constitute the novelty of the study.

Controlling the concentration of cells at a given position across the width of a channel is an important aspect in the design of microfluidic devices. Despite its biomedical importance, the collective spreading of red blood cells (RBCs) in a microchannel has not yet been fully clarified. In this study, we experimentally investigated the collective spreading of RBCs in a straight microchannel, and found that RBCs initially distributed in one side of the microchannel spread to the spanwise direction during downstream flow. Spreading increased considerably as the hematocrit increased, though the flow rate had a small effect. We proposed a scaling argument to show that this spreading phenomenon was diffusive and mainly induced by cell-cell interactions. The dispersion coefficient was approximately proportional to the flow rate and the hematocrit. These results are useful in understanding collective behaviors of RBCs in a microchannel and in microcirculation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Eighteen healthy men performed a drop jump under barefoot and shod conditions. Vertical ground reaction force (GRF) was measured on a force plate during the contact phase of a drop jump, and GRF valuables were calculated for each condition. The angles of the knee and ankle joints, and the foot strike angle (the angle between the plantar surface of the foot and the ground during ground contact) as well as the electromyography of 7 muscles were measured. The shod condition showed a significant larger first peak GRF, longer time to first peak GRF from the initial ground contact and lower initial loading rate than the barefoot condition. The shod condition showed a significant larger ankle joint angle at initial ground contact, smaller knee joint angle between the second peak GRF and take-off as well as smaller foot strike angle at both initial ground contact and take-off than the barefoot condition. There were significant correlations between relative differences in ankle joint at the initial ground contact and relative differences in the initial loading rate. The muscle activity of all muscles during foot ground contact did not differ between two conditions; however, in the shod condition, muscle activation of 150 ms before foot ground contact was significantly higher in the rectus femoris, whereas it was lower in the biceps femoris and tibialis anterior muscles than the barefoot condition.

In this study, an analytical model is developed for a single-rooted natural tooth allowing the ASIST to estimate the stiffness characteristics of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The geometry and inertia parameters of the tooth model are presented in two ways: (1) using full CT scans of the individual tooth and (2) using an approximate geometry model with estimates of only the tooth length and diameter. The developed system is evaluated with clinical data for patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.

Strain and strain rate dependencies are often modelled using a hyperelastic model and a discrete (standard linear solid) or continuous spectrum (quasi-linear) viscoelastic model, respectively. However, these models are unable to properly capture the materials characteristics because hyperelastic models are unsuited for time-dependent events, whereas the common viscoelastic models are insufficient for the nonlinear and finite strain viscoelastic tissue responses. The convolution integral based models can demonstrate a finite viscoelastic response; however, their derivations are not consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. The aim of this work was to develop a three-dimensional finite hyper-viscoelastic model for soft tissues using a thermodynamically consistent approach. In addition, a nonlinear function, dependent on strain and strain rate, was adopted to capture the nonlinear variation of viscosity during a loading process. To demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of this approach, the model was used to recreate the experimental results performed on different types of soft tissues.

This study used 24 porcine thoracic motion segments to characterize the mechanical response of intact (N = 8), degenerated (Trypsin-denatured, N = 8), and repaired (Genepin-treated, N = 8) IVDs subject to impact loading. A meta-model analysis of poroelastic finite element simulations was used in combination with ex-vivo creep and impact tests to extract the material properties. Forward analyses using updated specimen-specific FE models were performed to evaluate the effect of impact duration. The maximum axial stress in the IVDs, Von-Mises stress in the endplates, and intradiscal pore pressure (IDP) were calculated, under a 400 N preload, subject to a sequence of impact loads for 10 impact durations (10-100 ms). The results were in good agreement with both creep and impact experiments (error < 10%). A significant difference was found in the maximum axial stress between the intact and degenerated disc groups. The IDP was also significantly lower in the degenerated disc group. The Von Mises stress in the adjacent endplates significantly increased with degeneration. It is concluded that the disc time-dependent response significantly changes with disc degeneration. Cross-linker Genipin has the potential to recover the hydraulic permeability and can potentially change the time dependent response, particularly in the IDP.

These tests consist in a subjective evaluation of gait performed by healthcare professionals, most of the time shortly after the first fall occurrence. We propose to complement this one-time, subjective evaluation, by a more quantitative analysis of the gait pattern using a Microsoft Kinect. To evaluate the potential of the Kinect sensor for such a quantitative gait analysis, we benchmarked its performance against that of a gold-standard motion capture system, namely the OptiTrack. The ""Kinect"" analysis relied on a home-made algorithm specifically developed for this sensor, whereas the OptiTrack analysis relied on the ""built-in"" OptiTrack algorithm. We measured different gait parameters as step length, step duration, cadence, and gait speed in twenty-five subjects, and compared the results respectively provided by the Kinect and OptiTrack systems. These comparisons were performed using Bland-Altman plot (95% bias and limits of agreement), percentage error, Spearman's correlation coefficient, concordance correlation coefficient and intra-class correlation. The agreement between the measurements made with the two motion capture systems was very high, demonstrating that associated with the right algorithm, the Kinect is a very reliable and valuable tool to analyze gait. Importantly, the measured spatio-temporal parameters varied significantly between age groups, step length and gait speed proving the most effective discriminating parameters. Kinect-monitoring and quantitative gait pattern analysis could therefore be routinely used to complete subjective clinical evaluation in order to improve fall risk assessment during rehabilitation.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a specimen fixture system for spine biomechanical testing that uses components of clinically available spinal fixation hardware and determine whether the new system provides sufficient rigidity for spine biomechanical testing. Custom testing blocks were mounted into a robotic testing system and the angular deflection of the upper fixture was measured indirectly using linear variable differential transformers. The fixture system had an overall stiffness 37.0, 16.7 and 13.3 times greater than a typical human functional spine unit for the flexion/extension, axial rotation and lateral bending directions respectively - sufficient rigidity for biomechanical testing. Fixture motion when mounted to a lumbar spine specimen revealed average motion of 0.6, 0.6, and 1.5° in each direction.

The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Two types of flow paths distributing blood to the array of membranes were evaluated: parallel and serpentine. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to guide the development of the blood flow paths. Pressure data from animal tests were used to obtain pulsatile flow conditions imposed in the transient simulations. A key consideration for stable operation in vivo is limiting platelet stress accumulation to avoid platelet activation and thrombus formation. Platelet stress exposure was evaluated by CFD particle tracking methods through the devices to provide distributions of platelet stress accumulation. The distributions of stress accumulation over the duration of a platelet lifetime for each device revealed that stress accumulation for the serpentine flow path exceeded levels expected to cause platelet activation while the accumulated stress for the parallel flow path was below expected activation levels.,True,Journal of biomechanics,False

ANOVA indicated significant group differences and a significant interaction between group and days for relative nucleus pulposus area and for multifidus mass normalized to body mass. No significant effects were observed for whole IVD area. At 14 days post-op, the IVD lesion group had a significantly smaller relative nucleus pulposus area than control and multifidus resection groups. Nucleus pulposus size did not differ from control at 7 and 28 days. At 7 days post-intervention, normalized multifidus mass was significantly lower (20%) in the IVD lesion group.

The aim of this paper is to determine the best procedure for body pose reconstruction and inverse dynamics of speed skating, and to what extend this choice influences the estimation of joint power. The results show that an eight body segment model together with a global optimization method with revolute joint in the knee and in the lumbosacral joint, while keeping the other joints spherical, would be the most realistic model to use for the inverse kinematics in speed skating. To determine joint power, this method should be combined with a least-square error method for the inverse dynamics. Reporting on the BPR technique and the inverse dynamic method is crucial to enable comparison between studies. Our data showed an underestimation of up to 74% in mean joint power when no optimization procedure was applied for BPR and an underestimation of up to 31% in mean joint power when a bottom-up inverse dynamics method was chosen instead of a least square error approach. Although these results are aimed at speed skating, reporting on the BPR procedure and the inverse dynamics method, together with setting a golden standard should be common practice in all human movement research to allow comparison between studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous comparison studies suggest that low compared to high capacity old adults exhibit larger magnitudes of this plasticity, however the precise relationship between capacity and plasticity magnitude remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between physical capacity and biomechanical plasticity magnitude during level and incline walking. Data were collected for 32 old adults walking over level and inclined (+10°) surfaces at self-selected, comfortable speeds. Physical capacity was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey Physical Component (SF-36 PC) and biomechanical plasticity was quantified by ratios of hip extensor to ankle plantarfexor peak torques, angular impulses, peak positive powers, and positive work (larger ratios indicate larger magnitudes of plasticity). SF-36 PC scores correlated positively with all four biomechanical plasticity ratios during level walking and three of the four ratios during incline walking. Some of the biomechanical plasticity ratios correlated positively with comfortable walking speeds and stride frequencies, indicating better walking performance with larger magnitudes of plasticity. Additionally, all four biomechanical plasticity ratios were larger during incline compared to level walking, suggesting the need for larger magnitudes of plasticity during the more difficult task.

These specimens are typically excluded from impact studies with the assumption that the fractures will alter the thoracic response to loading. We previously used the Global Human Body Models Consortium 50th percentile whole-body finite element model (GHBMC M50-O) to demonstrate that up to three lateral or bilateral PERFs do not meaningfully influence the response of the GHBMC thorax to lateral loading. This current study used the GHBMC M50-O to explore the influence of PERFs on thorax response in frontal and oblique loading. Up to six PERFs were simulated on the anterior or lateral rib regions, and the model was subjected to frontal or oblique cylindrical impactor, frontal seatbelt, or frontal seatbelt + airbag loading. Changes in thorax force-compression responses due to PERFs were generally minor, with the greatest alterations seen in models with six PERFs on one side of the ribcage. The observed changes, however, were small relative to mid-size male corridors for the loading conditions simulated.

This increased prevalence may be partially explained by altered low back biomechanics during movement. The purpose of this study was to compare trunk kinematics and L4-L5 lumbar loads in people with and without a transtibial amputation during sit-to-stand. Motion capture, ground reaction force and electromyographic data were collected from eight people with a unilateral transtibial amputation and eight people without an amputation during five self-paced sit-to-stand motions. A musculoskeletal model of the torso, lumbar spine, pelvis, lower limbs, and 294 muscles was used in a static optimization framework to quantify L4-L5 loads, low back muscle forces, and trunk kinematics. Participants with an amputation had greater peak and average L4-L5 loading in compression compared to control participants, with peak loading occurring shortly after liftoff from the chair. At the instant of peak loading, participants with an amputation had significantly greater segmental trunk lateral bending and trunk-pelvis axial rotation toward the intact side, and significantly greater segmental trunk axial rotation toward the prosthetic side compared to control participants. Participants with an amputation also had greater peak frontal plane and transverse plane segmental trunk angular velocity. The postural differences observed in people with a transtibial amputation were consistent with their ground reaction force asymmetry. The cumulative effects of the altered movement strategy used by people with an amputation may result in an increased risk for low back pain development over time.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

FE studies of the hip often assume there is no significant loss of fluid pressurization in the articular cartilage during simulated activities and approximate the material as incompressible and elastic. This study examined the conditions under which interstitial fluid load support remains sustained during physiological motions, as well as the role of the labrum in maintaining fluid load support and the effect of its presence on the solid phase of the surrounding cartilage. We found that dynamic motions of gait and squatting maintained consistent fluid load support between cycles, while static single-leg stance experienced slight fluid depressurization with significant reduction of solid phase stress and strain. Presence of the labrum did not significantly influence fluid load support within the articular cartilage, but prevented deformation at the cartilage edge, leading to lower stress and strain conditions in the cartilage. A morphologically accurate representation of collagen fibril orientation through the thickness of the articular cartilage was not necessary to predict fluid load support. However, comparison with simplified fibril reinforcement underscored the physiological importance. The results of this study demonstrate that an elastic incompressible material approximation is reasonable for modeling a limited number of cyclic motions of gait and squatting without significant loss of accuracy, but is not appropriate for static motions or numerous repeated motions. Additionally, effects seen from removal of the labrum motivate evaluation of labral reattachment strategies in the context of labral repair.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Characterizing the mechanical properties of breast cancer tissue is important for diagnosis and uncovering the mechanobiology mechanism. Although most of the studies were based on human cancer tissue, an animal model is still describable for preclinical analysis. Using a custom-build indentation device, we measured the viscoelastic properties of breast cancer tissue from 4T1 and SKBR3 cell lines. A total of 7 samples were tested for each cancer tissue using a mouse model. We observed that a viscoelastic model with 2-term Prony series could best describe the ramp and stress relaxation of the tissue. For long-term responses, the SKBR3 tissues were stiffer in the strain levels of 4-10%, while no significant differences were found for the instantaneous elastic modulus. We also found tissues from both cell lines appeared to be strain-independent for the instantaneous elastic modulus and for the long-term elastic modulus in the strain level of 4-10%. In addition, by inspecting the cellular morphological structure of the two tissues, we found that SKBR3 tissues had a larger volume ratio of nuclei and a smaller volume ratio of extracellular matrix (ECM). Compared with prior cellular mechanics studies, our results indicated that ECM could contribute to the stiffening the tissue-level behavior. The viscoelastic characterization of the breast cancer tissue contributed to the scarce animal model data and provided support for the linear viscoelastic model used for in vivo elastography studies. Results also supplied helpful information for modeling of the breast cancer tissue in the tissue and cellular levels.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study quantified how body borne load impacts knee biomechanics for participants who do and do not present varus thrust (range of knee adduction motion exhibited from heel strike to mid-stance (0-51%)) during over-ground running. Eighteen (9 varus thrust and 9 control) military personnel had knee biomechanics recorded when running with three load conditions (light, ∼6 kg, medium, 15% BW, and heavy, 30% BW). Subject-based means for knee biomechanics were calculated and submitted to a RM ANOVA to test the main effects and possible interactions between load and varus thrust group. The varus thrust group exhibited greater varus thrust (p = .001) and peak stance (PS, 0-100%) knee adduction (p = .009) posture compared to the control group with the light load, but not for the medium (p = .741 and p = .825) or heavy loads (p = .142 and p = .429).

The trunk sensor is used to describe humeral and scapular kinematics with respect to the trunk. There are two common trunk sensor placements, the sternum or third thoracic vertebrae (T3). It is currently unclear if placement of the trunk sensor affects kinematics, making it difficult to compare data across studies. The purpose of this study was to compare two trunk sensor placements (T3 and sternum) on trunk and scapular kinematics during arm elevation. An electromagnetic tracking system was used to collect kinematic data during five consecutive repetitions of ascending and descending arm elevation in the sagittal plane. The results indicate that trunk sensor placement had no significant effect on trunk kinematics or scapular upward/downward rotation and internal/external rotation. Scapular anterior/posterior tilt was significantly greater when the trunk sensor was on the sternum compared to the T3 vertebrae during ascending 30°-120°: mean difference = -3.51° (95%CI: -5.61, -1.40), and descending 120°-30°: mean difference = -3.27° (95%CI: -6.07, -0.48).

A Sawbones shoulder phantom was fitted with a RTSA implant set and 13 tantalum markers. The model was fixed to a manual micrometer, providing controlled movements though fifteen known increments in translation and twelve increments in rotation (0.02-5.00 mm and 0.1-6.0°), along each translation and rotation axis. Movement between the glenoid and humerus was assessed using beads vs. beads (B/B), model vs. beads (M/B), and model vs. model (M/M) measurement methods in a model-based RSA environment.

In this study, micro finite element (µFE) models were used to assess the specific influence of screw design and the relative contribution of local bone density to fixation mechanics. These were created from micro computer tomography (µCT) scans of vertebras implanted with two types of pedicle screws, including a full region-or-interest of 10 mm radius around each screw, as well as submodels for the pedicle and inner trabecular bone of the vertebral body. The local bone volume fraction (BV/TV) calculated from the µCT scans around different regions of the screw (pedicle, inner trabecular region of the vertebral body) were then related to the predicted stiffness in simulated pull-out tests as well as to the experimental pull-out and torsional fixation properties mechanically measured on the corresponding specimens. Results show that predicted stiffness correlated excellently with experimental pull-out strength (R2 > 0.92, p < .043), better than regional BV/TV alone (R2 = 0.79, p = .003). They also show that correlations between fixation properties and BV/TV were increased when accounting only for the pedicle zone (R2 = 0.66-0.94, p ≤  .032), but with weaker correlations for torsional loads (R2 < 0.10).

Forward dynamics-based optimisations mainly track joint kinematics or torques, combined with a least-excitation criterion. Tracking marker trajectories and/or electromyography (EMG) has rarely been proposed. Our objective was to determine the best tracking objective-function to accurately predict the upper-limb muscle forces. A musculoskeletal model was created and EMG was simulated to obtain a reference movement - a shoulder abduction. A Gaussian noise (mean = 0; standard deviation = 15%) was added to the simulated EMG. Another noise - corresponding to the actual soft tissue artefacts (STA) of experimental shoulder abduction movements - was added to the trajectories of the markers placed on the model. Muscle forces were estimated from these noisy data, using forward dynamics assisted by six non-linear least-squared objective-functions. These functions involved the tracking of marker trajectories, joint angles or torques, with and without EMG-tracking. All six approaches used the same musculoskeletal model and were solved using a direct multiple shooting algorithm. Finally, the predicted joint angles, muscle forces and activations were compared to the reference values, using root-mean-square errors (RMSe) and biases. The force RMSe of the approach tracking both marker trajectories and EMG (18.45 ± 12.60 N) was almost five times lower than the one of the approach tracking only joint angles (82.37 ± 66.26 N) or torques (85.10 ± 116.40 N). Therefore, using EMG as a complementary tracking-data in forward dynamics seems to be promising for the estimation of muscle forces.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Variability in joint kinematics is necessary for adaptability and response to everyday perturbations; however, intrinsic neuromotor changes secondary to stroke often cause abnormal movement patterns. How these abnormal movement patterns relate to joint kinematic variability and its influence on post-stroke walking impairments is not well understood.


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the movement variability at the individual joint level in the paretic and non-paretic limbs of individuals post-stroke.


METHODS
Seven individuals with hemiparesis post-stroke walked on a treadmill for two minutes at their self-selected speed and the average speed of the six-minute walk test while kinematics were recorded using motion-capture. Variability in hip, knee, and ankle flexion/extension angles during walking were quantified with the Lyapunov exponent (LyE). Interlimb differences were evaluated.


RESULTS
The paretic side LyE was higher than the non-paretic side at both self-selected speed (Hip: 50%; Knee: 74%), and the average speed of the 6-min walk test (Hip: 15%; Knee: 93%).


CONCLUSION
Differences in joint kinematic variability between limbs of persons post-stroke supports further study of the source of non-paretic limb deviations as well as the clinical implications of joint kinematic variability in persons post-stroke. The development of bilaterally-targeted post-stroke gait interventions to address variability in both limbs may promote improved outcomes.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Among all possible recovery options, three main strategies are often considered for human balance control, being the ankle, hip, and foot placement strategies. All can be addressed when balance is threatened during walking, but their relative importance remains uncertain. We have previously shown that healthy human subjects did not significantly adjust their foot placement relative to the body's center of mass (COM) in the first recovery step following anteroposterior pelvis perturbations, as compared to unperturbed walking. An ankle strategy could have contributed to the recovery instead. Here the goal is to further elucidate balance strategy preferences by investigating the stepping and hip strategies following these anteroposterior perturbations, but with an ankle strategy made ineffective. This was achieved by physically blocking each ankle and minimizing the support area of each foot through a pair of modified ankle-foot orthoses. These ""pin-shoes"" enabled stilt-like walking and ensured that foot placement adjustment was the only way to modulate the center of pressure location, comparable to ""footless"" inverted pendulum models of walking. Despite the pin-shoes, subjects did not additionally address a hip strategy compared to normal walking, but relied on foot placement adjustments instead. The observed foot placement adjustments were furthermore in line with concepts derived from a linear inverted pendulum model of walking. These results suggest low hip strategy priority when a foot placement strategy is available, while the latter can be predicted with concepts derived from a simple walking model.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As in vivo forces are difficult to measure directly, modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate these forces. Validation of model estimates is critical to gain confidence in modeling results across populations of interest, such as people with lower-limb amputation. Motion capture, ground reaction force and electromyographic data were collected from ten participants without an amputation (five male/five female) and five participants with a unilateral transtibial amputation (four male/one female) during trunk-pelvis range of motion trials in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. A musculoskeletal model with a detailed lumbar spine and the legs including 294 muscles was used to predict L4-L5 loading and muscle activations using static optimization. Model estimates of L4-L5 intervertebral joint loading were compared to measured intradiscal pressures from the literature and muscle activations were compared to electromyographic signals. Model loading estimates were only significantly different from experimental measurements during trunk extension for males without an amputation and for people with an amputation, which may suggest a greater portion of L4-L5 axial load transfer through the facet joints, as facet loads are not captured by intradiscal pressure transducers. Pressure estimates between the model and previous work were not significantly different for flexion, lateral bending or axial rotation.

While several computational hemodynamic models of the pulmonary vasculature have been developed to understand PAH, they are lacking in some aspects, such as the vessel wall deformation and its lack of calibration against measurements in humans. Here, we describe a computational modeling framework that addresses these limitations. Specifically, computational models describing the coupling of hemodynamics and vessel wall mechanics in the pulmonary vasculature of a PAH patient and a normal subject were developed. Model parameters, consisting of linearized stiffness E of the large vessels and Windkessel parameters for each outflow branch, were calibrated against in vivo measurements of pressure, flow and vessel wall deformation obtained, respectively, from right-heart catheterization, phase-contrast and cine magnetic resonance images. Calibrated stiffness E of the proximal PA was 2.0 and 0.5 MPa for the PAH and normal models, respectively. Calibrated total compliance CT and resistance RT of the distal vessels were, respectively, 0.32 ml/mmHg and 11.3 mmHg∗min/l for the PAH model, and 2.93 ml/mmHg and 2.6 mmHg∗min/l for the normal model. These results were consistent with previous findings that the pulmonary vasculature is stiffer with more constricted distal vessels in PAH patients. Individual effects on PA pressure due to remodeling of the distal and proximal compartments of the pulmonary vasculature were also investigated in a sensitivity analysis. The analysis suggests that the remodeling of distal vasculature contributes more to the increase in PA pressure than the remodeling of proximal vasculature.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous computational models developed to study rotator cuff tears have not modeled tissue damage and tear propagation. The objective of this study was to predict tear propagation for various combinations of tear size and location using an experimentally validated finite element model of supraspinatus tendon. It was hypothesized that larger rotator cuff tears propagate at lower loads than smaller tears, and that posterior tears require higher loads to propagate than anterior tears. Using a previously validated computational model of supraspinatus tendon, tears of size 0.5-1.5 cm were introduced to the tendon geometry in the anterior, middle, and posterior tendon thirds. Cohesive elements were assigned subject-specific failure properties and used to model tissue damage and tear propagation. A displacement of 5 mm was applied to the medial tendon edge to induce tear propagation. Model outputs included critical load required to propagate the tear, and principal stress and maximum principal strain at the anterior and posterior tear tips. For all tear sizes, posterior tears required the highest loads to propagate (247-567 N). Anterior tears generally required the least load to propagate (171-280 N). Stress and strain were larger on the articular side (maximum 33.9% articular strain vs 27.8% bursal strain).

However, it is presently unclear whether this control strategy is retained when walking at the slower speeds preferred by many clinical populations. We investigated whether the typical stabilization strategy is influenced by walking speed. Twelve young, neurologically intact participants walked on a treadmill at a range of prescribed speeds (0.2-1.2 m/s). The mediolateral stabilization strategy was quantified as the proportion of step width variance predicted by the mechanical state of the pelvis throughout a step (calculated as R2 magnitude from a multiple linear regression). Our ability to accurately predict the upcoming step width increased over the course of a step. The strength of the relationship between step width and pelvis mechanics at the start of a step was reduced at slower speeds. However, these speed-dependent differences largely disappeared by the end of a step, other than at the slowest walking speed (0.2 m/s). These results suggest that mechanics-dependent adjustments in step width are a consistent component of healthy gait across speeds and contexts. However, slower walking speeds may ease this control by allowing mediolateral repositioning of the swing leg to occur later in a step, thus encouraging slower walking among clinical populations with limited sensorimotor control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Interpersonal coordination did not change from the first to the second set of the match, showing that tennis players maintain their displacement characteristics and strategy, independently of proficiency level.

However, the influence of high-intensity perturbations on training efficiency is unclear within this context. Sixteen participants (29±2yrs; 175±8cm; 69±13kg) were prepared with a 12-lead bilateral trunk EMG. Warm-up on a dynamometer was followed by maximum voluntary isometric trunk (flex/ext) contraction (MVC). Next, participants performed four conditions for a one-legged stance with hip abduction on a stable surface (HA) repeated randomly on an unstable surface (HAP), on a stable surface with perturbation (HA+P), and on an unstable surface with perturbation (HAP+P). Afterwards, bird dog (BD) was performed under the same conditions (BD, BDP, BD+P, BDP+P). A foam pad under the foot (HA) or the knee (BD) was used as an unstable surface. Exercises were conducted on a moveable platform. Perturbations (ACC 50m/sec2;100ms duration;10rep.) were randomly applied in the anterior-posterior direction. The root mean square (RMS) normalized to MVC (%) was calculated (whole movement cycle). Muscles were grouped into ventral right and left (VR;VL), and dorsal right and left (DR;DL). Ventral-Dorsal and right-left ratios were calculated (two way repeated-measures ANOVA;α=0.05). Amplitudes of all muscle groups in bird dog were higher compared to hip abduction (p≤0.0001; Range: BD: 14±3% (BD;VR) to 53±4%; HA: 7±2% (HA;VR) to 16±4% (HA;DR)). EMG-RMS showed significant differences (p<0.001) between conditions and muscle groups per exercise. Interaction effects were only significant for HA (p=0.02). No significant differences were present in EMG ratios (p>0.05). Additional high-intensity perturbations during core-specific sensorimotor exercises lead to increased neuromuscular activity and therefore higher exercise intensities. However, the beneficial effects on trunk function remain unclear. Nevertheless, BD is more suitable to address trunk muscles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigated whether the failure of these models to account for different types of motor units contributes to this apparent weakness; if so, muscle-driven simulations may rely on excessively high muscle excitations to generate a given force. We ran a series of forward simulations that reproduced measured ankle mechanics during cycling at five cadences ranging from 60 to 140 RPM. We generated both ""nominal"" simulations, in which an abstract ankle model was actuated by a 1-element Hill-type plantar flexor with a single contractile element (CE), and ""test"" simulations, in which the same model was actuated by a 2-element plantar flexor with two CEs that accounted for the force-generating properties of slower and faster motor units. We varied the total excitation applied to the 2-element plantar flexor between 60 and 105% of the excitation from each nominal simulation, and we varied the amount distributed to each CE between 0 and 100% of the total. Within this test space, we identified the excitation level and distribution, at each cadence, that best reproduced the plantar flexor forces generated in the nominal simulations. Our comparisons revealed that the 2-element model required substantially less total excitation than the 1-element model to generate comparable forces, especially at higher cadences. For instance, at 140 RPM, the required excitation was reduced by 23%. These results suggest that a 2-element model, in which contractile properties are ""tuned"" to represent slower and faster motor units, can increase the apparent strength and perhaps improve the fidelity of simulations of tasks with varying mechanical demands.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

To this aim, two approaches are currently adopted: computational fluid-dynamics, which yields highly resolved three-dimensional data but relies on simplifying assumptions, and in vitro experiments, which typically involve the direct video-acquisition of the flow field and provide 2D data only. We propose a novel method that exploits space- and time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow) to quantify the complex 3D flow field in blood-processing devices and to overcome these limitations. We tested our method on a real device that integrates an oxygenator and a heat exchanger. A dedicated mock loop was implemented, and novel 4D-flow sequences with sub-millimetric spatial resolution and region-dependent velocity encodings were defined. Automated in house software was developed to quantify the complex 3D flow field within the different regions of the device: region-dependent flow rates, pressure drops, paths of the working fluid and wall shear stresses were computed. Our analysis highlighted the effects of fine geometrical features of the device on the local fluid-dynamics, which would be unlikely observed by current in vitro approaches. Also, the effects of non-idealities on the flow field distribution were captured, thanks to the absence of the simplifying assumptions that typically characterize numerical models. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first of its kind and could be extended to the analysis of a broad range of clinically relevant devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This article introduces the sphere-based registration method to minimize the fiducial (reference landmark) localization error (FLE) in tracking and coregistration of physical and virtual dental models, to enable an effective clinical analysis of the patient's masticatory functions. In this method, spheres (registration fiducials) are placed on the corresponding polygonal concavities of the physical and virtual dental models based on the geometrical principle that establishes a unique spatial position for a sphere inside an infinite trihedron. The experiments in this study were implemented using an optical system which tracked active tracking markers connected to the upper and lower dental casts. The accuracy of the tracking workflow was confirmed in vitro, based on comparing virtually calculated interocclusal regions of close proximity against the physical interocclusal impressions. The target registration error of the tracking was estimated based on the leave-one-sphere-out method to be the sum of the error of the sensors, i.e., the FLE was negligible. Moreover, based on a user study, the FLE of the proposed method was confirmed to be 5 and 10 times smaller than the FLE of conventional fiducial selections on the physical and virtual models, respectively. The proposed tracking method is non-invasive and appears to be sufficiently accurate. To conclude, the proposed registration and tracking principles can be extended to track any biomedical and non-biomedical geometries that contain polygonal concavities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The CSWE device was first validated with an ultrasound-based surface wave elastography (USWE) device on a phantom. The CSWE device was then validated with the USWE device on both the dorsal and ventral arms of a volunteer.

The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of the supraspinatus muscle to shoulder elevation at sub-maximal levels. Seven healthy subjects (four males, three females) performed isometric ramp contractions at the shoulder. Middle deltoid electromyography (EMG) and force applied at the wrist were collected before and after a suprascapular nerve block. For the same level of deltoid EMG, less external force will be measured after the nerve block as the supraspinatus muscle no longer contributes. The difference between the EMG/force curve was the contribution of the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus contributed 40%, 95% CI [32%-48%], to shoulder elevation. The effect of angle (p = .67) and % maximal voluntary contraction (p = .13) on supraspinatus contribution were not significant. The maximum is slightly less than reported in a previous suprascapular nerve block study using maximal contractions.

The reachable workspace, i.e. the area covered by the farthest points a subject can reach by hand without moving his/her body, shows promise but has yet to be validated, particularly in terms of reproducibility. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of the reachable workspace over a period of several weeks, and to assess the effects of two proposed acquisition protocols, as well as those of gender, and hand dominancy. Shoulder movements were recorded using a motion capture system on 10 female and 10 male healthy subjects during a random protocol, i.e. simply asking them to achieve the farthest points they could reach with their hands, and during a standardized protocol, i.e. asking them to perform predefined shoulder elevations while keeping their trunk and elbow straight. The standardized protocol was repeated 7 weeks later. Repeated measures showed no significant difference, good to excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (0.46-0.81) and small bias (0.0-1.2%). The random protocol provided significantly lower and more scattered values for the reachable workspace (80.0 ± 22.6% vs. 91.0 ± 8.1%, p = .004), whereas gender and hand-dominancy had no effect.

The fundamental parameter is the time course of the force, which is classified visually in particular in the field of clinical diagnostics. Here, the knowledge and experience of the diagnostician is relevant for its assessment. For an objective and valid discrimination of the ground reaction force pattern, a generic method, especially in the medical field, is absolutely necessary to describe the qualities of the time-course. The aim of the presented method was to combine the approaches of two existing procedures from the fields of machine learning and the Gauss approximation in order to take advantages of both methods for the classification of ground reaction force patterns. The current limitations of both methods could be eliminated by an overarching method. Twenty-nine male athletes from different sports were examined. Each participant was given the task of performing a one-legged stopping maneuver on a force plate from the maximum possible starting speed. The individual time course of the ground reaction force of each subject was registered and approximated on the basis of eight Gaussian distributions. The descriptive coefficients were then classified using Bayesian regulated neural networks. The different sports served as the distinguishing feature. Although the athletes were all given the same task, all sports referred to a different quality in the time course of ground reaction force. Meanwhile within each sport, the athletes were homogeneous. With an overall prediction (R = 0.938) all subjects/sports were classified correctly with 94.29% accuracy. The combination of the two methods: the mathematical description of the time course of ground reaction forces on the basis of Gaussian distributions and their classification by means of Bayesian regulated neural networks, seems an adequate and promising method to discriminate the ground reaction forces without any loss of information.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Consequently, the predicted displacements have not yet been satisfactorily validated. In this study, real time motion capture of the natural vibrations of a breast that followed, after raising and allowing it to fall freely, revealed an obvious difference in the vibration characteristics above and below the static equilibrium position. This implied that the elastic and viscous damping properties of a breast could vary under extension or compression. Therefore, a new piecewise mass-spring-damper model of a breast was developed with theoretical equations to derive values for its spring constants and damping coefficients from free-falling breast experiments. The effective breast mass was estimated from the breast volume extracted from a 3D body scanned image. The derived spring constant (ka = 73.5 N m-1) above the static equilibrium position was significantly smaller than that below it (kb = 658 N m-1), whereas the respective damping coefficients were similar (ca = 1.83 N s m-1, cb = 2.07 N s m-1). These values were used to predict the nipple displacement during bare-breasted running for validation. The predicted and experimental results had a 2.6% or less root-mean-square-error of the theoretical and experimental amplitudes, so the piecewise mass-spring-damper model and equations were considered to have been successfully validated. This provides a theoretical basis for further research into the dynamic, nonlinear viscoelastic properties of different breasts and the prediction of external forces for the necessary breast support during different sports activities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As kinesio tape is adhered directly to the skin, it can be supposed that any pathway needs to first achieve effects at this level. To address this, two layers of the skin, the combined epidermis and dermis, as well as the hypodermis were studied. Specifically, -kinematic measures of skin surface stretch and retraction, as well as ultrasound measures of skin thickness, were made along all edges of kinesio tape applied over the low back. Results demonstrated that the more superficial skin layer (combined epidermis and dermis), but not the deeper hypodermis, was significantly stretched (p = .0001) and thinner (p = .0016) at either end of the tape, and significantly retracted (p < .0001) and thicker (p = .0001) along the lateral edges of the tape. These results were partly dependent upon spine posture; skin retraction along the tape edges was only apparent in neutral and flexed (but not extended) spine postures, while skin thinning at the tape ends was only apparent in neutral and extended (but not flexed) spine postures. Hypodermal thickness was not affected by kinesio tape application at any location or in any posture. In summary, measured deformations at the skin surface and within the epidermal and dermal regions provide plausible pathways through which kinesio tape could achieve its claimed benefits.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Impact of initial and inflow boundary conditions.,"Personalized computational hemodynamics (CH) is a promising tool to clarify/predict the link between low density lipoproteins (LDL) transport in aorta, disturbed shear and atherogenesis. However, CH uses simplifying assumptions that represent sources of uncertainty. In particular, modelling blood-side to wall LDL transfer is challenged by the cumbersomeness of protocols needed to obtain reliable LDL concentration profile estimations. This paucity of data is limiting the establishment of rigorous CH protocols able to balance the trade-offs among the variety of in vivo data to be acquired, and the accuracy required by biological/clinical applications. In this study, we analyze the impact of LDL concentration initialization (initial conditions, ICs) and inflow boundary conditions (BCs) on CH models of LDL blood-to-wall transfer in aorta. Technically, in an image-based model of human aorta, two different inflow BCs are generated imposing subject-specific inflow 3D PC-MRI measured or idealized (flat) velocity profiles. For each simulated BC, four different ICs for LDL concentration are applied, imposing as IC the LDL distribution resulting from steady-state simulations with average conditions, or constant LDL concentration values. Based on CH results, we conclude that: (1) the imposition of realistic 3D velocity profiles as inflow BC reduces the uncertainty affecting the representation of LDL transfer; (2) different LDL concentration ICs lead to markedly different patterns of LDL transfer. Given that it is not possible to verify in vivo the proper LDL concentration initialization to be applied, we suggest to carefully set and unambiguously declare the imposed BCs and LDL concentration IC when modelling LDL transfer in aorta, in order to obtain reproducible and ultimately comparable results among different laboratories.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this paper, we test the hypothesis that integrating morphological and biomechanical risk factors would result in better predictive power for plaque progression prediction. A sample size of 374 intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) slices was obtained from 9 patients with IVUS follow-up data. 3D fluid-structure interaction models were constructed to obtain both structural stress/strain and fluid biomechanical conditions. Data for eight morphological and biomechanical risk factors were extracted for each slice. Plaque area increase (PAI) and wall thickness increase (WTI) were chosen as two measures for plaque progression. Progression measure and risk factors were fed to generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed-effect models to perform prediction and correlation analysis, respectively. All combinations of eight risk factors were exhausted to identify the optimal predictor(s) with highest prediction accuracy defined as sum of sensitivity and specificity. When using a single risk factor, plaque wall stress (PWS) at baseline was the best predictor for plaque progression (PAI and WTI). The optimal predictor among all possible combinations for PAI was PWS + PWSn + Lipid percent + Min cap thickness + Plaque Area (PA) + Plaque Burden (PB) (prediction accuracy = 1.5928) while Wall Thickness (WT) + Plaque Wall Strain (PWSn) + Plaque Area (PA) was the best for WTI (1.2589).

Tissue engineering has provided a promising biological treatment strategy that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, current approaches in translating these techniques to developing large engineered tissues remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a method for developing large-scale engineered cartilage surfaces through modular fabrication. Modular Engineered Tissue Surfaces (METS) uses the well-known, but largely under-utilized self-adhesion properties of de novo tissue to create large scaffolds with nutrient channels. Compressive mechanical properties were evaluated throughout METS specimens, and the tensile mechanical strength of the bonds between attached constructs was evaluated over time. Raman spectroscopy, biochemical assays, and histology were performed to investigate matrix distribution. Results showed that by Day 14, stable connections had formed between the constructs in the METS samples. By Day 21, bonds were robust enough to form a rigid sheet and continued to increase in size and strength over time. Compressive mechanical properties and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content of METS and individual constructs increased significantly over time. The METS technique builds on established tissue engineering accomplishments of developing constructs with GAG composition and compressive properties approaching native cartilage. This study demonstrated that modular fabrication is a viable technique for creating large-scale engineered cartilage, which can be broadly applied to many tissue engineering applications and construct geometries.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although, key factors of the origin of the disease is still unknown, it is widely believed that cholesterol particle penetration and accumulation in arterial wall is mainly responsible for further wall thickening and decreased rate of blood flow during a gradual progression. To date, various effective components are recognized whose simultaneous consideration would lead to a more accurate approximation of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) distribution within the wall. In this research, a multilayer Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) model is studied to simulate the penetration of LDL into the arterial wall. Distention impact on wall properties is taken into account by considering FSI and Wall Shear Stress (WSS) dependent endothelium properties. The results show intensified permeation of LDL whilst the FSI approach is applied. In addition, luminal distension prompted by FSI reduces WSS along lumen/wall interface, especially in hypertension. This effect leads to a lowered endothelial resistance against LDL permeation, comparing to the case in which WSS effect is overlooked. The results are in an acceptable consistency with the clinical researches on WSS effect on atherosclerosis development.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims to quantify the temporal dependence of the hydrodynamic forces for a simple translation movement: an impulsive start from rest. The study, carried out in unsteady numerical simulation, couples the calculation of the lift and the drag on an expert swimmer hand-forearm model with visualizations of the flow and flow vortex structure analysis. The results of these simulations show that the hand and forearm hydrodynamic forces should be studied from an unsteady approach because the quasi-steady model is inadequate. It also appears that the delayed stall effect generates higher circulatory forces during a short translation at high angle of attack than forces calculated under steady state conditions. During this phase the hand force coefficients are approximately twice as large as those of the forearm. The total force coefficients are highest for angles of attack between 40° and 60°. For the same angle of attack, the forces produced when the leading edge is the thumb side are slightly greater than those produced when the leading edge is the little finger side.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this regard, it is imperative to investigate the mechanism effects of colchicine on biological cells. In this paper, we present a method for the detection of mechanical properties of nephrocytes (VERO cells), hepatocytes (HL-7702 cells) and hepatoma cells (SMCC-7721 cells) in culture by atomic force microscope (AFM) to analyze the 0.1 μg/mL colchicine-induced effects on the nanoscale for two, four and six hours. Compared to the corresponding control cells, the biomechanical properties of the VERO and SMCC-7721 cells changed significantly and the HL-7702 cells did not considerably change after the treatment when considering the same time period. Based on biomechanical property analyses, the colchicine solution made the VERO and SMCC-7721 cells harder. We conclude that it is possible to reduce the division rate of the VERO cells and inhibit the metastasis of the SMCC-7721 cells. The method described here can be applied to study biomechanics of many other types of cells with different drugs. Therefore, this work provides an accurate and rapid method for drug screening and mechanical analysis of cells in medical research.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Improper function of this musculature may lead to abnormal spinal loading, muscle strain, or injury to spinal structures, all of which have been associated with increased low back pain (LBP) risk. The purpose of this study was to identify potential strategies used to compensate for weakness of the deep core musculature during running and to identify accompanying changes in compressive and shear spinal loads. Kinematically-driven simulations of overground running were created for eight healthy young adults in OpenSim at increasing levels of deep core muscle weakness. The deep core muscles (multifidus, quadratus lumborum, psoas, and deep fascicles of the erector spinae) were weakened individually and together. The superficial longissimus thoracis was a significant compensator for 4 out of 5 weakness conditions (p < 0.05). The deep erector spinae required the largest compensations when weakened individually (up to a 45 ± 10% increase in compensating muscle force production, p = 0.004), revealing it may contribute most to controlling running kinematics. With complete deep core muscle weakness, peak anterior shear loading increased on all lumbar vertebrae (up to 19%, p = 0.001). Additionally, compressive spinal loading increased on the upper lumbar vertebrae (up to 15%, p = 0.007) and decreased on the lower lumbar vertebrae (up to 8%, p = 0.008). Muscular compensations may increase risk of muscular fatigue or injury and increased spinal loading over numerous gait cycles may result in damage to spinal structures. Therefore, insufficient strength of the deep core musculature may increase a runner's risk of developing LBP.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies have shown that damage accumulation and the phases of tendon healing are marked by significant changes in the extracellular matrix, but it remains unknown how mechanical forces of the extracellular matrix are translated to mechanotransduction pathways that ultimately drive the biological response. Our overarching hypothesis is that the unique relationship between extracellular matrix strain and cell deformation will dictate biological outcomes, prompting the need for quantitative methods to characterize the local strain environment. While 2-D methods have successfully calculated matrix strain and cell deformation, 3-D methods are necessary to capture the increased complexity that can arise due to high levels of anisotropy and out-of-plane motion, particularly in the disorganized, highly cellular, injured state. In this study, we validated the use of digital volume correlation methods to quantify 3-D matrix strain using images of naïve tendon cells, the collagen fiber matrix, and injured tendon cells. Additionally, naïve tendon cell images were used to develop novel methods for 3-D cell deformation and 3-D cell-matrix strain, which is defined as a quantitative measure of the relationship between matrix strain and cell deformation. The results support that these methods can be used to detect strains with high accuracy and can be further extended to an in vivo setting for observing temporal changes in cell and matrix mechanics during degeneration and healing.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, how the stretch modulates the functions of ion channels of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated the effects of mechanical stretch on the activity of large conductance calcium, voltage-activated potassium (BK) and L-type Ca2+ channels. In comparison with 5% stretch (physiological), 15% stretch (pathological) upregulated the current density of L-type Ca2+ and BK channels as well as the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillation in VSMCs. 15% stretch also increased the open probability and mean open time of the BK channel compared with 5% stretch. BK and L-type Ca2+ channels participated in the mechanical stretch-modulated calcium oscillation. Our results suggested that during hypertension, pathological stretch altered the activity of BK and L-type Ca2+ channels and manipulated the calcium oscillation of VSMCs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Most vertebral fractures develop spontaneously or due to mild trauma, as physiological loads during activities of daily living might exceed the failure load of osteoporotic vertebra. Spinal loading patterns are affected by vertebral kinematics, which differ between elderly and young individuals. In this study, the effects of age-related changes in spine kinematics on thoracolumbar spinal segmental loading during dynamic activities of daily living were investigated using combined experimental and modeling approach. Forty-four healthy volunteers were recruited into two age groups: young (N = 23, age = 27.1 ± 3.8) and elderly (N = 21, age = 70.1 ± 3.9). The spinal curvature was assessed with a skin-surface device and the kinematics of the spine and lower extremities were recorded during daily living tasks (flexion-extension and stand-sit-stand) with a motion capture system. The obtained data were used as input for a musculoskeletal model with a detailed thoracolumbar spine representation. To isolate the effect of kinematics on predicted loads, other model properties were kept constant. Inverse dynamics simulations were performed in the AnyBody Modeling System to estimate corresponding spinal loads. The maximum compressive loads predicted for the elderly motion patterns were lower than those of the young for L2/L3 and L3/L4 lumbar levels during flexion and for upper thoracic levels during stand-to-sit (T1/T2-T8/T9) and sit-to-stand (T3/T4-T6/T7). However, the maximum loads predicted for the lower thoracic levels (T9/T10-L1/L2), a common site of vertebral fractures, were similar compared to the young. Nevertheless, these loads acting on the vertebrae of reduced bone quality might contribute to a higher fracture risk for the elderly.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Prior examinations suggest these behaviors are expressions of abnormal cross-planar coupling of muscle activity. However, few studies have detailed the impact of gait-retraining paradigms on three-dimensional joint kinematics. In this study, a cross-tilt walking surface was examined as a novel gait-retraining construct. We hypothesized that relative to baseline walking kinematics, exposure to cross-tilt would generate significant changes in subsequent flat-walking joint kinematics during affected limb swing. Twelve post-stroke participants walked on a motorized treadmill platform during a flat-walking condition and during a 10-degree cross-tilt with affected limb up-slope, increasing toe clearance demand. Individuals completed 15 min of cross-tilt walking with intermittent flat-walking catch trials and a final washout period (5 min). For flat-walking conditions, we examined changes in pelvic obliquity, hip abduction/adduction and knee flexion kinematics at the spatiotemporal events of swing initiation and toe-off, and the kinematic event of maximum angle during swing. Pelvic obliquity significantly reduced at swing initiation and maximum obliquity in the final catch trial and late washout. Knee flexion significantly increased at swing initiation, toe-off, and maximum flexion across catch trials and late washout. Hip abduction/adduction was not significantly influenced following cross-tilt walking. Significant decrease in the rectus femoris and medial hamstrings muscle activity across catch trials and late washout was observed.

This study measured knee angles and intersegmental contact parameters in fifty-eight young healthy participants for six common high flexion postures using motion tracking and a pressure sensor attached to the right thigh. Additionally, we introduced and assessed the reliability of a method for reducing noise in pressure sensor output. Five repetitions of two squatting, two kneeling, and two unilateral kneeling movements were completed. Interactions of posture by sex occurred for thigh-calf and heel-gluteal center of force, and thigh-calf contact area. Center of force in thigh-calf regions was farther from the knee joint center in females, compared to males, during unilateral kneeling (82 and 67 mm respectively) with an inverted relationship in the heel-gluteal region (331 and 345 mm respectively), although caution is advised when generalizing these findings from a young, relatively fit sample to a population level. Contact area was larger in females when compared to males (mean of 155.61 and 137.33 cm2 across postures). A posture main effect was observed in contact force and sex main effects were present in onset and max angle. Males had earlier onset (121.0°) and lower max angle (147.4°) with onset and max angles having a range between movements of 8° and 3° respectively.

Furthermore, the role of facet joints in such motions is as yet unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing coupled motions in multiple spine sections in vitro, before and after removal of posterior elements. Six elderly human and 6 young porcine spines were sectioned in four segments (high thoracic, mid thoracic, low thoracic and lumbar), each consisting of four vertebrae and three intervertebral discs. Segments were loaded along each of the three axes, and three-dimensional rotations of the middle segment were quantified. Subsequently, posterior elements were removed and the protocol was repeated. To avoid mixed loading between Axial Rotation (AR) and Lateral Bending (LB), in contrast to other studies, local axes at the vertebrae were defined as aligned with the loading device prior to each load application. Expressed as a percentage of motion in the loaded direction, coupled motions were on average larger in human (22.7%, SD = 2.2%) than in porcine (11.9%, SD = 1.2%) spines (p < .001). Largest coupled motions were obtained in AR loading of the lumbar spine segments, with mean magnitudes averaged over coupling axes for human L2-L3 joints of 48.9% (SD = 13.2%), including somewhat more LB (56.4%, SD = 18.6) than FE (41.4%, SD = 14.1%) coupling. For porcine L3-L4 joints average coupling in AR loading was 29.3% (SD = 8.2%). In human segments removal of posterior elements only had substantial effects in the lumbar spine segments, where posterior element removal decreased coupled motion during AR loading, averaged over LB and FE coupling, from 48.9% (SD = 13.2%) to 27.7% (SD = 6.1%), mainly through increased motion in the loaded direction. The present results indicate that coupled motions were largest in the lumbar spine. In human spines, posterior elements only contributed to coupled motions in lumbar axial rotation loading.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of muscle tension on human impact response in terms of force and energy absorbed and the subjects' perceptions of pain. Seven male martial artists had a 3.9 kg medicine ball dropped vertically from seven different heights, 1.0-1.6 m in equal increments, onto their right thigh. Subjects were instructed to either relax or tense the quadriceps via knee extension (≥60% MVC) prior to each impact. F-scan pressure insoles sampling at 500 Hz recorded impact force and video was recorded at 1000 Hz to determine energy loss from the medicine ball during impact. Across all impacts force was 11% higher, energy absorption was 15% lower and time to peak force was 11% lower whilst perceived impact intensity was significantly lower when tensed. Whether muscle is tensed or not had a significant and meaningful effect on perceived discomfort. However, it did not relate to impact force between conditions and so tensing may alter localised injury risk during human on human type impacts.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

One potential cause for this is mechanical connections between the tendons and muscle bellies corresponding to the different fingers. The aim of this study was to determine the tendon displacement of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) of both the instructed and the neighboring, non-instructed fingers during single finger flexion movements. In nine healthy subjects (age 22-29 years), instructed and non-instructed FDS finger tendon displacement of the index, middle and ring finger was measured using 2D ultrasound analyzed with speckle tracking software in two conditions: active flexion of all finger joints with all fingers free to move and active flexion while the non-instructed fingers were restricted. Our results of the free movement protocol showed an average tendon displacement of 27 mm for index finger flexion, 21 mm for middle finger flexion and 17 mm for ring finger flexion. Displacements of the non-instructed finger tendons (≈12 mm) were higher than expected based of the amount of non-instructed finger movement. In the restricted protocol, we found that, despite minimal joint movements, substantial non-instructed finger tendon displacement (≈9 mm) was still observed, which was interpreted as a result of tendon strain. When this strain component was subtracted from the tendon displacement of the non-instructed fingers during the free movement condition, the relationship between finger movement and tendon displacement of the instructed and non-instructed finger became comparable. Thus, when studying non-instructed finger tendon displacement it is important to take tendon strain into consideration.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, locating internal joint centers from external characteristics of the body still remains a challenging issue, in particular for the spine. Current methods mostly require a set of rarely accessible (3D back or trunk surface) or operator dependent inputs (large number of palpated landmarks and landmarks-based anthropometrics). Therefore, there is a need to provide an alternative way to estimate joint centers only using a limited number of easily palpable landmarks and the external back profile. Two methods were proposed to predict the spinal joint centers: one using only 6 anatomical landmarks (ALs) (2 PSIS, T8, C7, IJ and PX) and one using both 6 ALs and the external back profile. Regressions were established using the X-ray based 3D reconstructions of 80 subjects and evaluated on 13 additional subjects of variable anthropometry. The predicted location of joint centers showed an average error 9.7 mm (±5.0) in the sagittal plane for all joints when using the external back profile. Similar results were obtained without using the external back profile, 9.5 mm (±5.0). Compared to other existing methods, the proposed methods offered a more accurate prediction with a smaller number of palpated points.

Existing theory suggests that the negative allometric scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is compensated by a matching allometric scaling of the chewing rate. Why empirical studies have found that the scaling coefficients of the chewing rate seem to be systematically smaller than expected from theory remains unknown. Here we explain this imparity by decoupling the functional surface area of teeth from overall surface area. The functional surface area is relatively reduced in forms emphasizing linear edges (e.g., lophodont) compared with forms lacking linear structures (e.g., bunodont). In forms with reduced relative functional surface, the deficit in food processed per chew appears to be compensated for by increased chewing rate, such that the metabolic requirements are met. This compensation accounts for the apparent difference between theoretically predicted and observed scaling of chewing rates. We suggest that this reflects adaptive functional evolution to plant foods with different fracture properties and extend the theory to incorporate differences in functional morphology.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

An improved understanding of its underlying mechanisms could lead to the development of more effective treatments. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of (1) degeneration, (2) circumferential region and (3) strain rate on the microscale mechanical properties (toe region modulus, linear modulus, extensibility, phase angle) of individual fibre bundles in the anulus fibrosus lamellae of the human intervertebral disc. Healthy and degenerate fibre bundles excised from different circumferential regions in the outer anulus (posterolateral, lateral, anterolateral, anterior) were tensile tested at slow (0.1%/s), medium (1%/s) and fast (10%/s) strain rates using a micromechanical testing system. Our preliminary results showed that neither degeneration nor circumferential region significantly affected the fibre bundles' mechanical behaviour. However, when the fibre bundles were tested at higher strain rates, this resulted in significantly higher linear moduli and lower phase angles. These findings, compared with data from other studies investigating single and multiple lamellae sections, suggest that degeneration has minimal effect on outer anulus mechanics irrespective of structural level, and the inter- and intra-lamellar arrangement and continuity of the fibre bundles may influence the lamellae's regional behaviour and viscoelasticity.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Discrete element analysis (DEA) is a computational technique for calculating intra-articular contact stress distributions in a fraction of the time required to obtain the same information using the more commonly employed finite element analysis technique. The goal of this work was to validate the accuracy of DEA-computed contact stress against physical measurements of contact stress made in cadaveric hips using Tekscan sensors. Four static loading tests in a variety of poses from heel-strike to toe-off were performed in two different cadaveric hip specimens with the acetabulum intact and again with an intentionally malreduced posterior wall acetabular fracture. DEA-computed contact stress was compared on a point-by-point basis to stress measured from the physical experiments. There was good agreement between computed and measured contact stress over the entire contact area (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.99). DEA-computed peak contact stress was within an average of 0.5 MPa (range 0.2-0.8 MPa) of the Tekscan peak stress for intact hips, and within an average of 0.6 MPa (range 0-1.6 MPa) for fractured cases. DEA-computed contact areas were within an average of 33% of the Tekscan-measured areas (range: 1.4-60%).

Although the cause of post-injury OA is multi-factorial, alterations in joint biomechanics may predispose patients to cartilage degeneration. This study aimed to compare in vivo PFJ morphology and mechanics between ACL deficient and intact knees in subjects with unilateral ACL ruptures. Eight male subjects underwent baseline MRI scans of both knees. They then performed a series of 60 single-legged hops, followed by a post-exercise MRI scan. This process was repeated for the contralateral knee. The MR images were converted into three-dimensional surface models of cartilage and bone in order to assess cartilage thickness distributions and strain following exercise. Prior to exercise, patellar cartilage was significantly thicker in intact knees as compared to ACL deficient knees by 1.8%. In response to exercise, we observed average patellar cartilage strains of 5.4 ± 1.1% and 2.5 ± 1.4% in the ACL deficient and intact knees, respectively. Importantly, the magnitude of patellar cartilage strain in the ACL deficient knees was significantly higher than in the intact knees. However, while trochlear cartilage experienced a mean strain of 2.4 ± 1.6%, there was no difference in trochlear cartilage strain between the ACL deficient and uninjured knees. In summary, we found that ACL deficiency was associated with decreased patellar cartilage thickness and increased exercise-induced patellar cartilage strain when compared to the uninjured contralateral knees.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study aimed to investigate the functional role of heel lifting during regaining balance from a perturbed state. Computer simulation was employed to objectively examine the effect of allowing/constraining heel lifting on balance performance. The human model consisted of 3 rigid body segments connected by frictionless joints. Movements were driven by joint torques depending on current joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level. Starting from forward-inclined and static straight-body postures, the optimization goal was to recover balance effectively (so that ground projection of the mass center returned to the inside of the base of support) and efficiently by adjusting ankle and hip joint activation levels. Allowing/constraining heel lifting resulted in virtually identical movements when balance was mildly perturbed at the smallest lean angle (8°). At larger lean angles (8.5° and 9°), heel lifting assisted balance recovery more evidently with larger joint movements. Partial and altered timings of ankle/hip torque activation due to constraining heel lifting reduced linear and angular momentum generation for avoiding forward falling, and resulted in hindered balancing performance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fingertip finite element models can help investigating these interactions, if they are built based on realistic geometrical data and material properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the fingertip geometry and its mechanical response under compression, and to identify the parameters of a hyperelastic material property associated to the fingertip soft tissues. Fingertip compression tests in an MRI device were performed on 5 subjects at either 2 or 4 N and at 15° or 50°. The MRI images allowed to document both the internal and external fingertip dimensions and to build 5 subject-specific finite element models. Simulations reproducing the fingertip compression tests were run to obtain the material property parameters of the soft tissues. Results indicated that two ellipses in the sagittal and longitudinal plane could describe the external fingertip geometry. The internal geometries indicated an averaged maximal thickness of soft tissues of 6.4 ± 0.8 mm and a 4 ± 1 mm height for the phalanx bone.

In recent studies, our group has reported alterations of bone's vascular porosity and lacunar-canalicular system microarchitecture in a rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. In this work, poroelastic finite element analysis was used to investigate whether these microstructural changes can affect interstitial fluid flow around osteocytes. Animal-specific finite element models were developed combining micro-CT reconstructions of bone microstructure and measures of the poroelastic material properties. These models were used to quantify and compare loading-induced fluid flow in the lacunar-canalicular system of ovariectomized and sham-operated rats. A parametric analysis was also used to quantify the influence of the lacunar-canalicular permeability and vascular porosity on the fluid velocity magnitude. Results show that mechanically-induced interstitial fluid velocity can be significantly reduced in the lacunar-canalicular system of ovariectomized rats. Interestingly, the vascular porosity is shown to have a major influence on interstitial fluid flow, while the lacunar-canalicular permeability influence is limited when larger than 10-20m2. Altogether our results suggest that microstructural changes associated with the osteoporotic condition can negatively affect interstitial fluid flow around osteocytes in the lacunar-canalicular system of cortical bone.

When walking (at a singular speed), larger trunk motions among persons with vs. without LLA are associated with larger spinal loads; however, modulating walking speed is necessary in daily life and thus understanding the influences of walking speed on spinal loads in persons with LLA is of particular interest here. Three-dimensional trunk-pelvic kinematics, collected during level-ground walking at self-selected (SSW) and two controlled speeds (∼1.0 and ∼1.4 m/s), were obtained for seventy-eight participants: 26 with transfemoral and 26 with transtibial amputation, and 26 uninjured controls (CTR). Using a kinematics-driven, non-linear finite element model of the lower back, the resultant compressive and mediolateral/anteroposterior shear loads at the L5/S1 spinal level were estimated. Peak values were extracted and compiled. Despite walking slower at SSW speeds (∼0.21 m/s), spinal loads were 8-14% larger among persons with transfemoral amputation vs. CTR. Across all participants, peak compressive, mediolateral, and anteroposterior shear loads increased with increasing walking speed. At the fastest (vs. slowest) controlled speed, these increases were respectively 24-84% and 29-77% larger among persons with LLA relative to CTR. Over time, repeated exposures to these increased spinal loads, particularly at faster walking speeds, may contribute to the elevated risk for low back pain among persons with LLA. Future work should more completely characterize relative risk in daily life between persons with vs. without LLA by analyzing additional activities and tissue-level responses.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In fast-moving cells such as fish Keratocytes, Lamellipodia including most cell area finds a fan-like shape during migration, with a variety of aspect ratio function of fish type. In this work, our purpose is to present a novel and more complete two-dimensional continuum mathematical model of actomyosin-cytosolic two-phase flow of a self-deforming Keratocyte with circular spreaded to steady fan-like shape. In the new approach, in addition to the two-phase flow of the F-actin and cytosol, the G-actin transport was spatiotemporally modeled. We also for the first time modeled the effect of variable volume fraction of the moving F-actin porous network on solute transport in the cytosolic fluid. Our novel fully-coupled mathematical model provides a better understanding of intracellular dynamics of fast-migrating Keratocytes; such as the F-actin centripetal and cytosolic fountain-like flows, free-active myosin distribution, distribution sequence of the G-actin, F-actin, and myosin, and myosin-induced pressure flied of cytoplasm as well as the map of intracellular forces like myosin contraction and adhesion traction. All these results are qualitatively and quantitatively in good agreement with experimental observations. According to a range of value of parameters used in this model, our steady state of moving Keratocyte finds fan-like shape with the same aspect ratio as wide category of fish Keratocytes. This new model can predict shape of Keratocytes in other range of parameter values.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Bandwidth, cost limitations, and ease of use has historically restricted the number and location of sensors worn on the body. In this paper, we describe a four-sensor configuration of IMUs placed on the shanks and thighs that is sufficient to provide an accurate measure of temporal gait parameters, spatial gait parameters, and joint angle dynamics during ambulation. Estimating spatial gait parameters solely from gyroscope data is preferred because gyroscopes are less susceptible to sensor noise and a system comprised of only gyroscopes uses decreased bandwidth compared to a typical 9 degree-of-freedom IMU. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of a novel method of step length estimation using gyroscopes attached to the shanks and thighs. An Inverted Pendulum Model algorithm (IPM) was proposed to calculate step length, stride length, and gait speed. The algorithm incorporates heel-strike events and average forward velocity per step to make these assessments. IMU algorithm accuracy was determined via concurrent validity with an instrumented walkway and results explained via the collision model of gait. The IPM produced accurate estimates of step length, stride length, and gait speed with a mean difference of 3 cm and an RMSE of 6.6 cm for step length, thus establishing a new approach for spatial gait parameter calculation. The lack of numerical integration in IPM makes it well suited for use in continuous monitoring applications where sensor sampling rates are restricted.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aims here are to evaluate the performance of an existing trunk musculoskeletal model, estimate maximum muscle stresses and spinal forces, and explore likely differences between males and females in maximum voluntary exertions. We, therefore, measured trunk strength and EMG activities of 19 healthy right-handed subjects (9 females and 10 males) in flexion, extension, lateral and axial directions. MVEs for all subjects were then simulated in a subject-specific trunk musculoskeletal model, and estimated muscle activities were compared with EMGs. Analysis of variance was used to compare measured moments and estimated spinal loads at the L5-S1 level between females and males. MVE moments in both sexes were greatest in extension (means of 236 Nm in males and 190 Nm in females) and least in left axial torque (97 Nm in males and 64 Nm in females). Being much greater in lateral and axial MVEs, coupled moments reached ∼50% of primary moments in average. Females exerted less moments in all directions reaching significance except in flexion. Muscle activity estimations were strongly correlated with measurements in flexion and extension (Pearson's r = 0.69 and 0.76), but the correlations were very weak in lateral and axial MVEs (Pearson's r = 0.27 and 0.13). Maximum muscle stress was in average 0.80 ± 0.42 MPa but varied among muscles from 0.40 ± 0.22  MPa in rectus abdominis to 0.99 ± 0.29 MPa in external oblique.

Segmental power calculations are performed using segment endpoint dynamics (kinetic method). A theoretically equivalent method is to measure the rate of change in a segment's mechanical energy state (kinematic method). However, these two methods have not produced experimentally equivalent results for segments proximal to the foot, with the difference in methods deemed the ""power imbalance."" In a 6 degree-of-freedom model, segments move independently, resulting in relative segment endpoint displacement and non-equivalent segment endpoint velocities at a joint. In the kinetic method, a segment's distal end translational velocity may be defined either at the anatomical end of the segment or at the location of the joint center (defined here as the proximal end of the adjacent distal segment). Our mathematical derivations revealed the power imbalance between the kinetic method using the anatomical definition and the kinematic method can be explained by power due to relative segment endpoint displacement. In this study, we tested this analytical prediction through experimental gait data from nine healthy subjects walking at a typical speed. The average absolute segmental power imbalance was reduced from 0.023 to 0.046 W/kg using the anatomical definition to ≤0.001 W/kg using the joint center definition in the kinetic method (95.56-98.39% reduction).

A shift of COR affects moment arms of muscles and ligaments; consequently, muscle and joint forces are altered. Based on posture- and level-specific trends of COR migration revealed by in vivo dynamic radiography during functional activities, it was postulated that the instantaneous COR location for a particular joint is optimized in order to minimize the joint reaction forces. A musculoskeletal multi-body model was employed to investigate the hypotheses that (1) a posterior COR in upright standing and (2) an anterior COR in forward flexed posture leads to optimized lumbar joint loads. Moreover, it was hypothesized that (3) lower lumbar levels benefit from a more superiorly located COR. The COR in the model was varied from its initial position in posterior-anterior and inferior-superior direction up to ±6 mm in steps of 2 mm. Movement from upright standing to 45° forward bending and backwards was simulated for all configurations. Joint reaction forces were computed at levels L2L3 to L5S1. Results clearly confirmed hypotheses (1) and (2) and provided evidence for the validity of hypothesis (3), hence offering a biomechanical rationale behind the migration paths of CORs observed during functional flexion/extension movement. Average sensitivity of joint force magnitudes to an anterior shift of COR was +6 N/mm in upright and -21 N/mm in 30° forward flexed posture, while sensitivity to a superior shift in upright standing was +7 N/mm and -8N/mm in 30° flexion. The relation between COR loci and joint loading in upright and flexed postures could be mainly attributed to altered muscle moment arms and consequences on muscle exertion. These findings are considered relevant for the interpretation of COR migration data, the development of numerical models, and could have an implication on clinical diagnosis and treatment or the development of spinal implants.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The model calculates shoe-floor coefficient of friction (COF) in boundary lubrication regime where effects of adhesion friction and hydrodynamic pressures are negligible. The validity of model outputs was assessed by comparing model predictions to the experimental results from mechanical COF testing.

Gene transfection efficiency, cell viability and cytotoxicity, tenogenic gene expression, collagen I/III synthesis were evaluated in vitro. For the in vivo study, the transfected cells were transplanted into the rat patellar tendon window defect. At weeks 2 and 8 of post-surgery, the repaired tendon tissues were harvested for histological and biomechanical examinations. The transfected TDSCs revealed relatively stable transfection efficiency (80-90%) with active cell viability means while rare cytotoxicity in each group. During days 1 and 5, BMP12 and CTGF transfection caused tenogenic differentiation genes activation in TDSCs: type I/III collagen, tenascin-C, and scleraxis were all up-regulated, whereas osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic markers were all down-regulated respectively. In addition, BMP12 and CTGF overexpression significantly promote type I/III collagen synthesis. After in vivo transplantation, at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery, BMP12, CTGF and co-transfection groups showed more integrated tendon tissue structure versus control, meanwhile, the ultimate failure loads and Young's were all higher than control.

Toe-in and toe-out gait modifications typically reduce the first and second KAM peaks, respectively. We investigated whether assigning a subject-specific foot progression angle (FPA) modification reduces the peak KAM by more than assigning the same modification to everyone. To explore the effects of motor learning on muscle coordination and kinetics, we also evaluated the peak knee flexion moment and quadriceps-hamstring co-contraction during normal walking, when subjects first learned their subject-specific FPA, and following 20 min of training. Using vibrotactile feedback, we trained 20 healthy adults to toe-in and toe-out by 5° and 10° relative to their natural FPA, then identified the subject-specific FPA as the angle where each subject maximally reduced their larger KAM peak. When walking at their subject-specific FPA, 18 subjects significantly reduced their larger KAM peak; 8 by toeing-in and 10 by toeing-out. On average, subjects reduced their larger KAM peak by 18.6 ± 16.2% when walking at their subject-specific FPA, which was more than the reductions achieved when all subjects toed-in by 10° (10.0 ± 17.1%, p = .013) or toed-out by 10° (11.0 ± 18.3%, p = .002). Quadriceps-hamstring co-contraction and the peak knee flexion moment increased when subjects first learned their subject-specific FPA, but only co-contraction returned to baseline levels following training. These findings demonstrate that subject-specific gait modifications reduce the peak KAM more than uniformly assigned modifications and have the potential to slow the progression of medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, these current models rely on certain simplifications, one being that the MV has a static, rigid annulus. In order to study more complex issues of imaging diagnostics and implanted device function, it would be more advantageous to verify their use for a dynamic environment in a dynamic simulator. This study provides the novel design and development of a dynamically contracting annulus (DCA) within an in vitro simulator, and its subsequent use to study MV biomechanics. Experiments were performed to study the ability of the DCA to reproduce the MV leaflet mechanics in vitro, as seen in vivo, as well as investigate how rigid annuloplasties affect MV leaflet mechanics. Experiments used healthy, excised MVs and normal hemodynamics; contractile waveforms were derived from human in vivo data. Stereophotogrammetry and echocardiography were used to measure anterior leaflet strain and the change in MV geometry. In pursuit of the first in vitro MV simulator that more completely represents the dynamic motion of the full valvular apparatus, this study demonstrated the successful operation of a dynamically contracting mitral annulus.

We utilized displacement encoded MRI to measure changes in cartilage deformation following creation of a critical-sized defect in the medial femoral condyle of ovine (sheep) knees, a common in situ and large animal model of tissue damage and repair. We prioritized visualization of local, site-specific variation and changes in displacements and strains following defect placement by measuring spatial maps of intratissue deformation. Custom data smoothing algorithms were developed to minimize propagation of noise in the acquired MRI phase data toward calculated displacement or strain, and to improve strain measures in high aspect ratio tissue regions. Strain magnitudes in the femoral, but not tibial, cartilage dramatically increased in load-bearing and contact regions especially near the defect locations, with an average 6.7% ± 6.3%, 13.4% ± 10.0%, and 10.0% ± 4.9% increase in first and second principal strains, and shear strain, respectively. Strain heterogeneity reflected the complexity of the in situ mechanical environment within the joint, with multiple tissue contacts defining the deformation behavior. This study demonstrates the utility of displacement encoded MRI to detect increased deformation patterns and strain following disruption to the cartilage structure in a clinically-relevant, large animal defect model. It also defines imaging biomarkers based on biomechanical measures, in particular shear strain, that are potentially most sensitive to evaluate damage and repair, and that may additionally translate to humans in future studies.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, this study was aimed to utilize a portable pressure walkway system, which has been commonly used for pedobarographic and kinetic analysis in the veterinary field, to examine the effect of a failed tendon repair and tendon graft reconstruction on canine digit kinetics during gait. 12 mixed breed (mongrel) hound-type female dogs were included in this study and 2nd and 5th digits were chosen to undergo flexor tendon repair and graft surgeries. Kinetic parameters from the surgery leg in stance phase were calculated. From the results, after tendon failure repair, decrease of weight bearing was seen in the affected digits and weight bearing was shifted to the metacarpal pad. After tendon graft reconstruction, weight bearing returned to the affected digits and metacarpal pads. Slight alteration in peak pressure and instant of peak force were identified, but it was estimated to have little influence on post-reconstruction gait.

Lithium, a low-cost therapeutic used in psychiatric medicine, up-regulates the canonical Wingless pathway crucial for osteoblastic mineralization in fracture healing. A design-of-experiments (DOE) methodology was used to optimize lithium administration parameters (dose, onset time and treatment duration) to enhance healing in a rat femoral fracture model. In the previously completed first stage (screening), onset time was found to significantly impact healing, with later (day 7 vs. day 3 post-fracture) treatment yielding improved maximum yield torque. The greatest strength was found in healing femurs treated at day 7 post fracture, with a low lithium dose (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks duration. This paper describes the findings of the second (optimization) and third (verification) stages of the DOE investigation. Closed traumatic diaphyseal femur fractures were induced in 3-month old rats. Healing was evaluated on day 28 post fracture by CT-based morphometry and torsional loading. In optimization, later onset times of day 10 and 14 did not perform as well as day 7 onset. As such, efficacy of the best regimen (20 mg/kg dose given at day 7 onset for 2 weeks duration) was reassessed in a distinct cohort of animals to complete the DOE verification. A significant 44% higher maximum yield torque (primary outcome) was seen with optimized lithium treatment vs. controls, which paralleled the 46% improvement seen in the screening stage.

One surgical procedure for OSA is to implant polyethylene (PET) material into the soft palate, but its efficacy remains to be discussed. In this study, we provide input to this topic based on numerical simulations. Three 3 dimensional (3D) soft palate finite element models including mouth-close and mouth-open cases were created based on three patient-specific computed tomography (CT) images. A simplified material modeling approach with the Neo-Hookean material model was applied, and nonlinear geometry was accounted for. Young's modulus for the implant material was obtained from uniaxial tests, and the PET implant pillars were inserted to the 3D soft palate model. With the finite element model, we designed different surgical schemes and investigated their efficacy with respect to avoiding the soft palate collapse. Several pillar schemes were tested, including different placement directions, different placement positions, different settings for the radius and the array parameters of the implant pillars, and different Young's moduli for the pillars. Based on our simulation results, the longitudinal-direction implant surgery improved the stiffness of the soft palate to a small degree, and implanting in the transverse direction was evaluated to be a good choice for improving the existing surgical scheme. In addition, the Young's modulus of the polyethylene material implants has an influence on the reinforcement efficacy of the soft palate.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, in a previous study we proposed a HF estimation method based on ground reaction forces (GRFs) and body segment accelerations and tested it with laboratory equipment: GFRs were measured with force plates (FPs) and segment accelerations were measured using optical motion capture (OMC). In the current study, we evaluated the HF estimation method based on an ambulatory measurement system, consisting of inertial motion capture (IMC) and instrumented force shoes (FSs). Sixteen participants lifted and carried a 10-kg crate from ground level while 3D full-body kinematics were measured using OMC and IMC, and 3D GRFs were measured using FPs and FSs. We estimated 3D hand force vectors based on: (1) FP+OMC, (2) FP+IMC and (3) FS+IMC. We calculated the root-mean-square differences (RMSDs) between the estimated HFs to reference HFs calculated based on crate kinematics and the GRFs of a FP that the crate was lifted from. Averaged over subjects and across 3D force directions, the HF RMSD ranged between 10-15N when using the laboratory equipment (FP + OMC), 11-18N when using the IMC instead of OMC data (FP+IMC), and 17-21N when using the FSs in combination with IMC (FS + IMC).

A hill-type muscle model assuming an identical gearing G between both ΔFim and FG as well as lifting height of the load (Δh) and longitudinal muscle shortening (ΔlCC) reproduced experimental data for a single load. Here we tested if this model is able to reproduce experimental changes in ΔFim and Δh for increasing transverse loads (0.64 N, 1.13 N, 1.62 N, 2.11 N, 2.60 N). Three different gearing ratios were tested: (I) constant Gc representing the idea of a muscle specific gearing parameter (e.g. predefined by the muscle geometry), (II) Gexp determined in experiments with varying transverse load, and (III) Gf that reproduced experimental ΔFim for each transverse load. Simulations using Gc overestimated ΔFim (up to 59%) and Δh (up to 136%) for increasing load. Although the model assumption (equal G for forces and length changes) held for the three lower loads using Gexp and Gf, simulations resulted in underestimation of ΔFim by 38% and overestimation of Δh by 58% for the largest load, respectively. To simultaneously reproduce experimental ΔFim and Δh for the two larger loads, it was necessary to reduce Fim by 1.9% and 4.6%, respectively.

Those proteins can be selectively adsorbed onto the enamel surface. The cuticular material formed on the enamel surface is termed acquired salivary pellicle (ASP), which is critical for the health of oral mucosa and teeth. The ASP is composed of a inner layer and a outer layer. The lubricating properties of ASP are closely associated with the inner layer. The aim of this research is to characterize the structural and mechanical properties of the inner layer of ASP. In this paper, enamel specimens were immersed for 1 min in human saliva. The ASP formed in vitro within 1 min was studied using a nanoindenter. The results show that the thickness of the inner layer of ASP is approximately 18 nm. Moreover, the inner layer is a heterogeneous pellicle with a gradient in density. From the surface of the inner layer to the enamel surface, the density and mechanical properties gradually increase. The research results may be helpful to extend the understanding of mechanical properties of salivary pellicle and to the oral hygiene industry for diagnose oral diseases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, recent animal experiments indicate inferior BTX-A effects beyond the injected muscle. The goal was to test the following hypotheses in a rat model. (1) BTX-A injected into the GM and GL does not spread into the soleus (SOL), and muscles exposed show (2) a wider length range of force exertion (Lrange), (3) reduced passive forces and (4) no intermuscular interaction effects.

GM-GL and SOL muscle distal isometric forces were measured after GM-GL lengthening (condition-1, in which SOL length was kept constant) and with added SOL lengthening (condition-2). Five-days post, BTX-A injection caused significant effects: (1) all muscles showed force drops (minimally by 45%) indicating spread into the SOL.

This study investigated the effects of targeted muscle activation magnitude on impact dynamics during low energy falls on the hip with human volunteers. Fifteen university-aged participants (eight females, seven males) underwent 12 lateral pelvis release trials. Half of the trials were muscle-'relaxed'; in the remaining 'contracted' trials participants isometrically contracted their gluteus medius to 20-30% of maximal voluntary contraction before the drop was initiated onto a force plate. Peak force applied to the femur-pelvis complex averaged 9.3% higher in contracted compared to relaxed trials (F = 6.798, p = .022). Muscle activation effects were greater for females, resulting in (on average) an 18.5% increase in effective pelvic stiffness (F = 5.838, p = .046) and a 23.4% decrease in time-to-peak-force (F = 5.109, p = .042). In the relaxed trials, muscle activation naturally increased during the impact event, reaching levels of 12.8, 7.5, 11.1, and 19.1% MVC at the time of peak force for the gluteus medias, vastus lateralis, erector spinae, and external oblique, respectively. These findings demonstrated that contraction of trunk and hip musculature increased peak impact force across sexes. In females, increases in the magnitude and rate of loading were accompanied (and likely driven) by increases in system stiffness.

Previous studies of load-sharing that considered actual spinal geometry applied compressive follower load, with or without moment, to simulate muscle forces. Other studies used musculoskeletal models, which include muscle forces, but model the discs by simple beams or spherical joints and ignore the articular facet joints. This study investigated load-sharing in neutral standing and flexed postures using a detailed Finite Element (FE) model of the ligamentous lumbosacral spine, where muscle forces, gravity loads and intra-abdominal pressure, as predicted by a musculoskeletal model of the upper body, are input into the FE model. Flexion was simulated by applying vertebral rotations following spine rhythm measured in a previous in-vivo study, to the musculoskeletal model. The FE model predicted intradiscal pressure (IDP), strains in the annular fibers, contact forces in the facet joints, and forces in the ligaments. The disc forces and moments were determined using equilibrium equations, which considered the applied loads, including muscle forces and IDP, as well as forces in the ligaments and facet joints predicted by the FE model. Load-sharing was calculated as the portion of the total spinal load carried along the spine by each individual spinal structure. The results revealed that spinal loads which increased substantially from the upright to the flexed posture were mainly supported by the discs in the upright posture, whereas the ligaments' contribution in resisting shear, compression, and moment was more significant in the flexed posture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For a given head position, the helmet shape, by itself, obtained a weak effect on a cyclist's aerodynamic performance (<1.5%). However, by varying head position, a cyclist significantly influences aerodynamic performance; the maximum difference between both positions being about 6.4%.

This mechanism may relate to the center of mass (COM) motion. Moreover, lateral trunk lean gait may affect motor control of the COM displacement. Uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis is an evaluation index used to understand motor control and variability of the motor task. Here we aimed to clarify the biomechanical mechanism to reduce KAM during lateral trunk lean gait and how motor variability controls the COM displacement. Twenty knee OA patients walked under two conditions: normal and lateral trunk lean gait conditions. UCM analysis was performed with respect to the COM displacement in the frontal plane. We also determined how the variability is structured with regards to the COM displacement as a performance variable. The peak KAM under lateral trunk lean gait was lower than that under normal gait. The reduced peak KAM observed was accompanied by medially shifted knee joint center, shortened distance of the center of pressure to knee joint center, and shortened distance of the knee-ground reaction force lever arm during the stance phase. Knee OA patients with lateral trunk lean gait could maintain kinematic synergy by utilizing greater segmental configuration variance to the performance variable. However, the COM displacement variability of lateral trunk lean gait was larger than that of normal gait.

The experiment utilized kinematic and kinetic data from 323 male subjects with chronic athletic groin pain. All subjects undertook a biomechanical assessment and had been divided previously into 3 different movement strategies in an earlier paper. Examined supervised learning techniques were: a decision tree, an ensemble of decision trees, a discriminant analysis model, a naive Bayes classifier, a k-nearest-neighbour model, a multi-class model for support vector machines, a stepwise forward regression model, a neural network and a correlation approach. Performance (measured by comparing the predefined and classified movement pattern) was highest for the correlation approach (82% - CI 81-83%) and support vector machine (80% - CI 79-80%). The percentage of fuzzy observations within the data was between 16 and 25%. The most informative features for classification were: hip flexion and ankle rotation as well as ankle flexion moment, thorax [flexion and frontal sway], abduction angle in [hip and pelvis] and hip rotation.

The purpose of this study was to describe how continuum-level power analyses can be used to plan hypothesis-driven biomechanics experiments involving 1D data. In particular, we demonstrate how theory- and pilot-driven 1D effect modeling can be used for sample-size calculations for both single- and multi-subject experiments. For theory-driven power analysis we use the minimum jerk hypothesis and single-subject experiments involving straight-line, planar reaching. For pilot-driven power analysis we use a previously published knee kinematics dataset. Results show that powers on the order of 0.8 can be achieved with relatively small sample sizes, five and ten for within-subject minimum jerk analysis and between-subject knee kinematics, respectively. However, the appropriate sample size depends on a priori justifications of biomechanical meaning and effect size. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that it encourages a priori justification regarding the clinical and/or scientific meaning of particular 1D effects, thereby robustly structuring subsequent experimental inquiry. In short, it shifts focus from a search for significance to a search for non-rejectable hypotheses.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This procedure involves covering the primary entry tear to stimulate aortic remodelling and promote false lumen thrombosis thereby restoring true lumen flow. However, complications associated with incomplete false lumen thrombosis, such as aortic dilatation and stent graft induced new entry tears, can arise after TEVAR. This study presents the application and validation of a recently developed mathematical model for patient-specific prediction of thrombus formation and growth under physiologically realistic flow conditions. The model predicts thrombosis through the evaluation of shear rates, fluid residence time and platelet distribution, based on convection-diffusion-reaction transport equations. The model was applied to 3 type B aortic dissection patients: two TEVAR cases showing complete and incomplete false lumen thrombosis respectively, and one medically treated dissection with no signs of thrombosis. Predicted thrombus growth over time was validated against follow-up CT scans, showing good agreement with in vivo data in all cases with a maximum difference between predicted and measured false lumen reduction below 8%. Our results demonstrate that TEVAR-induced thrombus formation in type B aortic dissection can be predicted based on patient-specific anatomy and physiologically realistic boundary conditions. Our model can be used to identify anatomical or stent graft related factors that are associated with incomplete false lumen thrombosis following TEVAR, which may help clinicians develop personalised treatment plans for dissection patients in the future.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The etiology, however, has not been fully understood yet. Median nerve could be compressed by either increase of carpal tunnel pressure (CTP) or direct impingement when it is forced toward to carpal ligament especially in wrist flexion leading to CTS development. Thus, the increase of carpal tunnel pressure is considered an important role in CTS development. It has been identified that forces applied to the palm would affect the CTP. However, the quantitative relationship between palmar contact force and CTP is not known. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between palmar contact force and CTP. Eight human cadaveric hands were used. The CTP was measured with a diagnostic catheter-based pressure transducer inserted into the carpal tunnel. A custom made device was used to apply forces to the palm for the desired CTP. Palmar contact forces corresponding to the determined CTP level were recorded respectively. The testing was repeated with different ranges of tension applied to the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon of the third finger. The tensions were constant at 50 g for the other flexor tendons and median nerve. The results showed that CTP increased linearly with the force applied to the palm. When CTP was 30 mmHg, mean values of the contact force to the palm was 293 g (SD: 15.2) including all tensions.

At the submicroscale, the bone is composed of mineralized collagen fibrils (MCF). At this scale, the fracture processes in cortical bone have not been extensively studied in the literature. In this study, the influence of MCF size and orientation on the fracture behavior of bone under both transverse and longitudinal loading was investigated using novel 3D models of MCF networks with explicit representation of extra-fibrillar matrix. The simulation results showed that separation between MCFs was the main cause of damage and failure under transverse loading whereas under longitudinal loading, the main damage and failure mechanism was MCF rupture. When the MCF network was loaded in the transverse direction the mechanical properties increased as the orientation of fibrils deviated farther from the main fibril orientation whereas the opposite trend was observed under longitudinal loading. The fracture energy was much larger in longitudinal than transverse loading. MCF diameter variation did not affect the mechanical properties under longitudinal loading but led to higher mechanical properties with increasing MCF diameter under transverse loading. The new modeling framework established in this study generate unique information on the effect of MCF network spatial arrangement on the fracture behavior of bone at the submicroscale which is not currently possible to measure via experiments. This unique information may improve the understanding of how structural alterations at the submicroscale due to disease, age-related changes, and treatments affect the fracture processes at larger length scales.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Currently, these gait retraining procedures are mostly qualitative, often based on visual assessment and oral instructions. This study aimed to propose an alternative method combining motion capture and display of target footprints on the floor. The second objectives were to determine the error in footprint modifications and the effects of footprint modifications on lower-limb flexion/extension angles. An augmented-reality system made of an optoelectronic motion capture device and video projectors displaying target footprints on the floor was designed. 10 young healthy subjects performed a series of 27 trials, consisting of increased and decreased amplitudes in stride length, step width and foot progression angle. 11 standard features were used to describe and compare lower-limb flexion/extension angles among footprint modifications. Subjects became accustomed to walk on target footprints in less than 10 min, with mean (± SD) precision of 0.020 ± 0.002 m in stride length, 0.022 ± 0.006 m in step width, and 2.7 ± 0.6° in progression angle.

Cortical and trabecular regions contribute uniquely to distal radius mechanical behavior, and various factors affect these regions distinctly. Generalized strength predictions from standardized platen-compression analyses may not adequately capture region specific responses in bone. Our goal was to compare load sharing within the cortical-trabecular compartments between the standardized platen-compression BC simulations, and physiologic BC simulations using a validated multiscale approach. Clinical- and high-resolution images were acquired from nine cadaveric forearm specimens using an HR-pQCT scanner. Multiscale FE models simulating physiologic BCs, and micro-FE only models simulating platen-compression BCs were created for each specimen. Cortical and trabecular loads (N) along the length of the distal radius micro-FE section were compared between BCs using correlations. Principal strain distributions were also compared quantitatively. Cortical and trabecular loads from the platen-compression BC simulations were strongly correlated to the physiologic BC simulations. However, a 30% difference in cortical loads distally, and a 53% difference in trabecular loads proximally was observed under platen BC simulations. Also, distribution of principal strains was clearly different. Our data indicated that platen-compression BC simulations alter cortical-trabecular load sharing.

Data were obtained from 5 male highly trained wheelchair basketball players during match play. Players were equipped simultaneously with a tag on the footplate for the indoor tracking system (∼8 Hz) and inertial sensors on both wheels and frame (199.8 Hz). Being part of a larger study on 3 vs 3 player game formats, data were collected in several matches with varying field sizes, but activity profiles closely resembled regular match play. Both systems provide similar outcomes regarding distance covered and average speed. Due to differences in sampling frequency and sensor location (reference point) on the wheelchair (for speed calculation), minor differences were revealed at low speeds (<2.5 m/s).

Invivo measurements demonstrate that the disc volume, fluid content, height and nucleus pressure completely recover during resting even after diurnal loading with twice longer duration (16 vs. 8 h). In view of much longer periods required for the recovery of disc height and pressure in vitro, concerns have been raised on the fluid inflow through the endplates that might be hampered by clogged blood vessels post mortem. This in silico study aimed to identify fluid-flow dependent response of discs and conditions essential to replicate in vitro and in vivo observations. An osmo-poroelastic finite element model of the human lumbar L4-L5 disc-bone unit was used. Simulating earlier in vitro experiments on bovine discs, the loading protocol started with 8 h preload at 0.06 MPa followed by 30 high/low compression loading cycles each lasting 7.5min at 0.5/0.06 MPa, respectively. Three different endplate configurations were investigated: free in- and outflow, no inflow and closed endplates with no flow. Additionally, the preload magnitude was increased from 0.06 MPa to 0.28 MPa and 0.50 MPa, or the initial nucleus hydration was reduced from 83% to 50%. For 0.06 MPa preload, the model with no inflow best matched in vitro trends. The model with free inflow increased segment height and nucleus pressure while the model with no fluid inflow resulted in a relatively small recovery in segment height and a rather constant nucleus pressure during unloading periods. Results highlight an excessive mobile fluid content as well as a restricted fluid inflow through endplates as likely causes of the discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro studies.

Twenty-seven osteoporotic (BMD ranged: 0.353-0.848 g/cm2) thoracic vertebrae (T3-T8) were harvested from 5 human cadavers. Two sizes of poly-axial screws (5.0 mm × 35 and 4.35 mm × 35) were implanted into each pedicles of the vertebrae by an experienced surgeon. Specimens were randomly distributed into control group, fatigue group of 5000 and 10,000 cycles with peak-to-peak loadings of 10-100 N at 1 Hz. Each specimen was then axial pullout tested at a constant rate of 5 mm/min. The ultimate pullout strength (N) & stiffness (N/mm) were obtained for analysis. The results showed that although the larger diameter screws achieved superior pullout strength immediately after the implantation, both sizes of screws exhibited comparable pullout strengths post fatigue loading. This indicates that the smaller diameter screws may be considered for surgical techniques performed on osteoporotic vertebrae for reduced risk of pedicle breakage without sacrificing fixation strength.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To provide the means to accurately measure postural control in the clinical environment, this study checks and discusses the suitability of procedures for a new balance assessment system with a stabilometric platform (MoveHuman-Dyna © UZ-IDERGO), which meets the criteria of clinical stabilometric standardisation established by the International Society for Posture and Gait Research (ISPGR) at the Bologna meeting (2009). The study was applied to a sample of 30 healthy volunteers (12 women, 18 men) aged between 18 and 30 years. A total of six balance tests were performed: four variations of the Romberg test, one test for a study of the limits of stability (LoS) and one test for rhythmic weight shift (RWS). Analysis of the results confirms that the variables assessed yielded similar values to other studies, the consistency of values between tests was checked, and preliminary reference values were obtained for asymptomatic subjects. We propose the following variables as the most significant for balance diagnosis: CoP mean speed, RMS, Range of CoP displacement and area. As a result of the study, the system is considered of interest in the medical/legal and forensic settings to assess the balance control and degree of collaboration during the tests.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These forces (1-100 nN) can be measured by observing the local displacement of a flexible substrate upon which cells have been plated. Approaches employing this method include using microfabricated arrays of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) micropillars that bend by cellular traction forces. A tool capable of applying a force to FAs independently, by actively moving the micropillars, should become a powerful tool to delineate the cellular mechanotransduction mechanisms. Here, we developed a patterned magnetic micropillar array PDMS substrate that can be used for the mechanical stimulation of cellular FAs and the measurement of associated traction forces. The diameter, length, and center-to-center spacing of the micropillars were 3, 9, and 9 µm, respectively. Iron particles were embedded into the micropillars, enabling the pillars to bend in response to an external magnetic field, which also controlled their location on the substrate. Applying a magnetic field of 0.3 T bent the pillars by ∼4 µm and allowed transfer of external forces to the actin cytoskeleton through FAs formed on the pillar top. Using this approach, we investigated the traction force changes in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) after local compressive stimuli to release cell pretension. The mechanical responses of SMCs were roughly classified into two types: almost a half of the cells showed a little decrease of traction force at each pillar following compressive stimulation, although cell area increased significantly; and the rest showed the opposite, with increased forces and a simultaneous decrease in area. The traction forces of SMCs fluctuated markedly during the local compression. The root mean square of traction forces significantly increased during the compression, and returned to the baseline level after its release. These results suggest that the fluctuation of forces may be caused by active reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and/or its dynamic interaction with myosin molecules. Thus, our magnetic micropillar substrate would be useful in investigating the mechanotransduction mechanisms of cells.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Early diagnosis of OA with non-invasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could provide an opportunity to intervene and slow or reverse this degeneration process. This study examines the classification of degradation states using MRI measurements. Enzymatic degradation was used to specifically target proteoglycans alone, collagen alone and both cartilage components sequentially. The resulting degradation was evaluated using MRI imaging techniques (T1, T2, diffusion tensor imaging, and gadolinium enhanced T1) and derived measures of water, glycosaminoglycan and collagen content. We compared the classification ability of full thickness averages of these parameters with zonal averages (superficial, medial, and deep). Finally, we determined minimum variables sets to identify the smallest number of variables that allowed for complete separation of all degradation groups and ranked them by impact on the separation. Zonal analysis was much more sensitive than full thickness averages and allowed perfect separation of all four groups. Superficial zone cartilage was more sensitive to enzymatic degradation than the medial or deep zone, or the full thickness average. Variable ranking consistently identified collagen content and organization as the most impactful variables in the classification algorithm. The aim of this study is to classify cartilage degradation using only non-invasive MRI parameters that could be applied to OA diagnosis. Our results highlight the importance of zonal variation in the diagnosis of cartilage degeneration. Our novel, non-invasive collagen content measurement was crucial for complete separation of degraded groups from control cartilage.

However, there are concerns about the invasiveness of microCT imaging due to the X-rays ionising radiation induced by the repeated scans on the same animal. Therefore, the best compromise between radiation dose and image quality should be chosen for each preclinical application. In this study, we investigated the effect of integration time (time the bone is exposed to radiation at each rotation step during microCT imaging) on measurements performed on the mouse tibia. Four tibiae were scanned at 10.4 µm voxel size using four different procedures, characterized by decreasing integration time (from 200 ms to 50 ms) and therefore decreasing nominal radiation dose (from 513 mGy to 128 mGy). From each image, trabecular and cortical morphometric parameters, spatial distribution of bone mineral content (BMC) in the whole tibia and FE-based estimations of stiffness and strength were obtained. A high-resolution scan (4.3 µm voxel size) was used to quantify measurement errors. Integration time had the largest effect on trabecular morphometric parameters (7-28%). Lower effects were observed on cortical parameters (1-3%), BMC (1-10%) distribution, and FE-based estimations of mechanical properties (1-3%). In conclusion, the effect of integration time on image-based measurements has been quantified.

Despite the considerable efforts to unravel the peculiar fracture behavior of dentin, the effect of microstructural features on the fracture process is largely unknown. In this study, we explore the interaction between the primary crack with crack tip located in intertubular dentin (ITD) and microcracking of peritubular dentin (PTD) ahead of the primary crack. A micromechanical model accounting for the unique composite structure of dentin is developed, and computational simulations are performed. It is found that the microcracking of PTD located in the crack plane in front of the primary crack tip can promote the propagation of the primary crack, increasing the propensity of coalescence of primary crack and microcracks nucleating in PTD. We show that the two-layer microstructure of dentin enables reduction in driving force of primary crack, potentially enhancing fracture toughness. The high stiffness of PTD plays a critical role in reducing the driving force of primary crack and activating microcracking of PTD. It is further identified that the microcracking of PTD arranged parallel to the crack plane with an offset could contribute to the shielding of primary crack.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We examined the biomechanical/functional relevance of the GorabPrx1 mutants as a premature aging model by characterizing bone composition, tissue-level strains, and whole-bone morphology and mechanical properties of the tibia. MicroCT imaging showed that GorabPrx1 tibiae had an increased anterior convex curvature and decreased cortical cross-sectional area, cortical thickness and moments of inertia, compared to littermate control (LC) tibiae. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging indicated a 34% decrease in mineral/matrix ratio and a 27% increase in acid phosphate content in the posterior metaphyseal cortex of the GorabPrx1 tibiae (p < .05), suggesting delayed mineralization. In vivo strain gauge measurement and finite element analysis showed ∼two times higher tissue-level strains within the GorabPrx1 tibiae relative to LC tibiae when subjected to axial compressive loads of the same magnitude. Three-point bending tests suggested that GorabPrx1 tibiae were weaker and more brittle, as indicated by decreasing whole-bone strength (46%), stiffness (55%), work-to-fracture (61%) and post-yield displacement (47%).

However, it is unclear how tissue viscoelasticity controls viscoelasticity at the apparent-level. In this study, viscoelasticity of cylindrical human trabecular bone samples (n=11, male, age 18-78 years) from 11 proximal femurs were characterized using dynamic and stress-relaxation testing at the apparent-level and with creep nanoindentation at the tissue-level. In addition, bone tissue elasticity was determined using scanning acoustic microscope (SAM). Tissue composition and collagen crosslinks were assessed using Raman micro-spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively. Values of material parameters were obtained from finite element (FE) models by optimizing tissue-level creep and apparent-level stress-relaxation to experimental nanoindentation and unconfined compression testing values, respectively, utilizing the second order Prony series to depict viscoelasticity. FE simulations showed that tissue-level equilibrium elastic modulus (Eeq) increased with increasing crystallinity (r=0.730, p=.011) while at the apparent-level it increased with increasing hydroxylysyl pyridinoline content (r=0.718, p=.019). In addition, the normalized shear modulus g1 (r=-0.780, p=.005) decreased with increasing collagen ratio (amide III/CH2) at the tissue-level, but increased (r=0.696, p=.025) with increasing collagen ratio at the apparent-level. No significant relations were found between the measured or simulated viscoelastic parameters at the tissue- and apparent-levels nor were the parameters related to tissue elasticity determined with SAM. However, only Eeq, g2 and relaxation time τ1 from simulated viscoelastic values were statistically different between tissue- and apparent-levels (p<.01).

There is still a lack of knowledge, however, on how these parameters interact. Recently, various algorithms for the automatic detection of step parameters during sprint running have been presented which have been based on data from motion capture systems, video cameras, opto-electronic systems or Inertial measurement units. However, all of these methods suffer from at least one of the following shortcomings: they are (a) not applicable for more than one sprinter simultaneously, (b) only capable of capturing a small volume or (c) do not provide accurate spatial parameters. To circumvent these issues, the radio-based local position measurement system RedFIR could be used to obtain spatio-temporal information during sprinting based on lightweight transmitters attached to the athletes. To assess and optimize the accuracy of these parameters 19 100 m sprints of twelve young elite athletes (age: 16.5 ± 2.3 years) were recorded by a radio-based tracking system and a opto-electronic reference instrument. Optimal filter parameters for the step detection algorithm were obtained based on RMSE differences between estimates and reference values on an unseen test set. Attaching a transmitter above the ankle showed the best results. Bland-Altman analysis yielded 95% limits of agreement of [-14.65 cm, 15.05 cm] for step length [-0.016 s, 0.016 s] for step time and [-0.020 s, 0.028 s] for ground contact time, respectively. RMS errors smaller than 2% for step length and step time show the applicability of radio-based tracking systems to provide spatio-temporal parameters. This creates new opportunities for performance analysis that can be applied for any running discipline taking place within a stadium.

Intervertebral disc pressure provides insight into spinal loading, but such measurements are lacking in the thoracic spine. Thus, our objective was to examine thoracic intradiscal pressures under applied pure moments, and to determine the effect of the rib cage on these pressures. Human cadaveric thoracic spine specimens were positioned upright in a testing machine, and Dynamic pure moments (0 to ±5 N·m) with a compressive follower load of 400 N were applied in axial rotation, flexion - extension, and lateral bending. Disc pressures were measured at T4-T5 and T8-T9 using needle-mounted pressure transducers, first with the rib cage intact, and again after the rib cage was removed. Changes in pressure vs. moment slopes with rib cage removal were examined. Pressure generally increased with applied moments, and pressure-moment slope increased with rib cage removal at T4-T5 for axial rotation, extension, and lateral bending, and at T8-T9 for axial rotation. The results suggest the intact rib cage carried about 62% and 56% of axial rotation moments about T4-T5 and T8-T9, respectively, as well as 42% of extension moment and 36-43% of lateral bending moment about T4-T5 only.

The aim of the study was to compare upper body patterns of acceleration during planned gait termination at different speeds between young and older women. Ten young and 10 older women were asked to carry out three gait termination trials at slow, comfortable and fast speed. A stereophotogrammetric system and a 15-body segments model were used to calculate antero-posterior whole-body Center of Mass (AP CoM) speed and to reconstruct the centroids of head, trunk and pelvis segments. RMS of three-dimensional linear accelerations were calculated for each segment and the transmission of acceleration between two segments was expressed as a percentage difference. Older women reported lower AP CoM speed and acceleration RMS of the three upper body segments than young women across the three speed conditions. A lower pelvis-to-trunk attenuation of accelerations in the transverse plane was observed in older compared to young women, and mainly in the medio-lateral direction. As possible explanations, older women may not need to reduce acceleration as young women because of their lower progression speed and the subsequent acceleration at upper body levels. On the other hand, older women may prioritize a decrease in the whole body progression speed at expense of the involvement of upper body segments. This limits the attenuation of the accelerations, particularly in the transverse plane, implying an increased dynamic unbalance in performing this transitory task.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The cytoplasm and nucleoplasm fluid behavior in the cell is time dependent. When taking this approach, it is important to calibrate protoplasmic flow behaviors through simulation techniques such as compressing the cell and examining the agents representing the cell cytoplasm seeping between the ones representing the confining cell membrane. This type of modelling may motivate future work on simulating simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple cellular agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena such as protoplasmic seepage that is caused by the force actuations of neighboring cells. Seepage occurs when a cytoplasm agent passes between three membrane particles connected in a triangular network. Based on the force-deformation response of spheres having variable size and stiffness, semi-analytic expressions are developed for the force required to cause seepage and solved numerically to find the maximum resistance offered by the membrane against cytoplasm seepage. The equations are based on force equilibrium and the constitutive relations for particle contact and membrane stiffness. In multi-particle representations of an individual cell undergoing deformation, different modes of cytoplasm seepage through confining cell membranes can occur. This can be avoided if simple criteria are satisfied. These findings can lead to certain fundamental laws for the improvement of novel cell-to-organ simulation techniques based on discrete element method.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Most of past numerical studies focused on the cell deformation in small straight microvessels, or on the flow pattern in large curved vessels without considering the cell deformation. However, there have been few attempts to study the cell deformation and the associated flow pattern in a curved microvessel. In this work, a particle-based method, smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD), is used to simulate the motion and deformation of a RBC in a curved microvessel of diameter comparable to the RBC diameter. The emphasis is on the effects of the curvature, the type and the size of the curved microvessel on the RBC deformation and the flow pattern. The simulation results show that a small curved shape of the microvessel has negligible effect on the RBC behavior and the flow pattern which are similar to those in a straight microvessel. When the microvessel is high in curvature, the secondary flow comes into being with a pair of Dean vortices, and the velocity profile of the primary flow is skewed toward the inner wall of the microvessel. The RBC also loses the axisymmetric deformation, and it is stretched first and then shrinks when passing through the curved part of the microvessel with the large curvature. It is also found that a pair of Dean vortices arise only under the condition of De>1 (De is the Dean number, a ratio of centrifugal to viscous competition). The Dean vortices are more easily observed in the larger or more curved microvessels. Finally, it is observed that the velocity profile of primary flow is skewed toward the inner wall of curved microvessel, i.e., the fluid close to the inner wall flows faster than that close to the outer wall. This is contrary to the common sense in large curved vessels. This velocity skewness was found to depend on the curvature of the microvessel, as well as the viscous and inertial forces.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While the conversion of musculotendon force to fingertip force can significantly be affected by finger posture, current techniques utilizing geometric moment arms may not capture such complex postural effects. Here, we attempted to elucidate the postural effects on the mapping between musculotendon force and fingertip force through in vitro experiments. Computer-controlled tendon loading was implemented on the 7 index finger musculotendons of 5 fresh-frozen cadaveric hands across different postures. The resulting fingertip forces/moments were used to compute the effective static moment arm (ESMA), relating tendon force to joint torque, at each joint. The ESMAs were subsequently modeled in three different manners: independent of joint angle; dependent only upon the corresponding joint angle; or dependent upon all joint angles. We found that, for the reconstruction of the fingertip force vector, the multi-joint ESMA model yielded the best outcome, both in terms of direction and magnitude of the vector (mean reconstruction error <4° in direction and <2% in the magnitude), which indicates that intersegmental force transmission through a joint is affected by the posture of neighboring joints. Interestingly, the ESMA model that considers geometric changes of individual joints, the standard model used in biomechanical stimulations, often yielded worse reconstruction results than the simple constant-value ESMA model. Our results emphasize the importance of accurate description of the multi-joint dependency of the conversion of tendon force to joint moment for proper prediction of fingertip force direction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To investigate whether peak wall tension in abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs at the site of rupture to test for a causative relationship.


METHODS
Four ruptured and nine unruptured AAA were harvested whole from cadavers, followed by regional measurements of wall thickness, elastic parameters and failure tension. Finite element models were developed with subject-specific load-free AAA morphology and heterogeneous properties interpolated using a geodesic distance weighted approach from the measurements. The wall tension under uniform pressure and tension to failure tension ratio as an index of susceptibility to rupture were computed. As a secondary aim, the peak wall tension using this heterogeneous model approach was compared to the traditional homogeneous model approach in order to evaluate the reliability of the latter.


RESULTS
The average peak wall tension in the ruptured group was 43% higher than in the unruptured group without statistical significance even though it was 54% larger in diameter. The site of peak wall tension was in the vicinity of the site of rupture in two ruptured AAA. The peak tension did not breach failure tension at the rupture site in any of the AAA. The traditional population-wide homogeneous model approach overestimated peak wall tension by just 3% compared to the subject-specific heterogeneous model approach.


CONCLUSION
We failed to find adequate evidence of a causative relationship between peak wall tension and AAA rupture.

Whereas gait LDS has been used successfully in many settings and applications, little is known about its sensitivity to individual characteristics of healthy adults. Therefore, we reanalyzed a large dataset of accelerometric data measured for 100 healthy adults from 20 to 70 years of age performing 10 min treadmill walking. We sought to assess the extent to which the variations of age, body mass and height, sex, and preferred walking speed (PWS) could influence gait LDS. The random forest (RF) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithms were selected for their good bias-variance tradeoff and their capabilities to handle nonlinear associations. First, through variable importance measure (VIM), we used RF to evaluate which individual characteristics had the highest influence on gait LDS. Second, we used MARS to detect potential interactions among individual characteristics that may influence LDS. The VIM and MARS results indicated that PWS and age correlated with LDS, whereas no associations were found for sex, body height, and body mass. Further, the MARS model detected an age by PWS interaction: on one hand, at high PWS, gait stability is constant across age while, on the other hand, at low PWS, gait instability increases substantially with age. We conclude that it is advisable to consider the participants' age as well as their PWS to avoid potential biases in evaluating dynamic balance through LDS.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

A complex interaction between biochemicals, cells, and mechanical cues affects CAVD initiation and progression. In this study, motivated by the progression of calcification in regions of high strain, we developed a finite element method (FEM) based spatial calcification progression model. Several cardiac cycles of transient structural FEM simulations were simulated. After each simulation cycle, calcium deposition was placed in regions of high circumferential strain. Our results show the radial expansion of calcification as spokes starting from the attachment region, agreeing very well with the reported clinical data.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty-four males performed anticipated and unanticipated cuts with and without a dual cognitive task with three load conditions: no load (∼6 kg), medium load (15% of BW), and heavy load (30% of BW). Lower limb biomechanics were submitted to a repeated measures linear mixed model to test the main and interaction effects of load, anticipation, and dual task. With body borne load, participants increased peak stance (PS) hip flexion (p = .004) and hip internal rotation (p = .001) angle, and PS hip flexion (p = .001) and internal rotation (p = .018), and knee flexion (p = .016) and abduction (p = .001) moments. With the dual task, participants decreased PS knee flexion angle (p < .001) and hip flexion moment (p = .027), and increased PS knee external rotation angle (p = .034). During the unanticipated cut, participants increased PS hip (p = .040) and knee flexion angle (p < .001), and decreased PS hip adduction (p = .001), and knee abduction (p = .005) and external rotation (p = .026) moments. Adding body borne load produces lower limb biomechanical adaptations thought to increase risk of musculoskeletal injury, but neither anticipation nor dual task exaggerated those biomechanical adaptations.

The purpose of this study was to quantify lumbar FJ kinematics in healthy individuals during functional activity with dynamic stereo radiography (DSX) imaging. Ten asymptomatic participants lifted three known weights starting from a trunk-flexed (∼75°) position to an upright position while being imaged within the DSX system. High resolution computed tomography (CT) scan-derived 3D models of their lumbar vertebrae (L2-S1) were registered to the biplane 2D radiographs using a markerless model-based tracking technique providing instantaneous 3D vertebral kinematics throughout the lifting tasks. Effects of segment level and weight lifted were assessed using mixed-effect repeated measures ANOVA. Superior-inferior (SI) translation dominated FJ translation, with L5S1 showing significantly less translation magnitudes (Median (Md) = 3.5 mm, p < 0.0001) than L2L3, L3L4, and L4L5 segments (Md = 5.9 mm, 6.3 mm and 6.6 mm respectively). Linear regression-based slopes of continuous facet translations revealed strong linearity for SI translation (r2 > 0.94), reasonably high linearity for sideways sliding (Z-) (r2 > 0.8), but much less linearity for facet gap change (X-) (r2 ∼ 0.5). Caudal segments (L4-S1), particularly L5S1, displayed greater coupling compared to cranial (L2-L4) segments, revealing distinct differences overall in FJ translation trends at L5S1. No significant effect of weight lifted on FJ translations was detected.

Studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid enters the spinal cord via the perivascular spaces, and that changes in the timing of the subarachnoid pressures may increase flow into the spinal cord. This study aims to determine how Chiari malformation and syringomyelia alter the subarachnoid space pressures and hence perivascular flow. Subject-specific models of healthy controls (N = 9), Chiari patients with (N = 7) and without (N = 8) syringomyelia, were developed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to simulate the subarachnoid pressures. These pressures were input to an idealised model of the perivascular space to evaluate potential differences in perivascular flow. Peak pressures in Chiari patients without a syrinx were higher than in controls (46% increase; p = .029) and arrived earlier in the cardiac cycle than both controls (2.58% earlier; p = .045) and syrinx patients (2.85% earlier; p = .045). The perivascular model predicted Chiari patients without a syrinx would have the greatest flow into the cord (p < .05) if the arterial pulse delay was between 4 and 10% of the cardiac cycle. Using phase-contrast MRI the mean arterial delay for all subjects was similar, and was estimated as 4.7 ± 0.2%. The perivascular pumping rate showed a strong positive correlation (RAdj2=0.85; p < .0001) with extended periods of high pressure that arrived earlier in the cardiac cycle, suggesting these pressure characteristics may play a role in syrinx development.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twelve healthy young subjects participated in the study. The subjects walked at their preferred walking speed under four conditions: STM, STM with a metronome (STM+met), fixed-speed (conventional) treadmill (FTM), and FTM with a metronome (FTM+met). To compare the fractal dynamics between conditions, the mean, variability, and fractal dynamics of ST, SL, and SS were compared. Moreover, the relationship among the variables was examined under each walking condition using three types of surrogates. The mean values of all variables did not differ between the two treadmills, and the variability of all variables was generally larger for STM than for FTM. The use of a metronome resulted in a decrease in variability in ST and SS for all conditions. The fractal dynamic characteristics of SS were maintained with STM, in contrast to FTM, and only the fractal dynamic characteristics of ST disappeared when using a metronome. In addition, the fractal dynamic patterns of the cross-correlated surrogate results were identical to those of all variables for the two treadmills. In terms of the fractal dynamic properties, STM walking was generally closer to overground walking than FTM walking.

It is unknown, however, to what extent the time-dependent behaviour can be attributed to osmosis. Here we investigate the effect of both mechanical and osmotic loading on water content, nucleus pressure and disc height. Eight goat intervertebral discs, immersed in physiological saline, were subjected to a compressive force with a pressure needle inserted in the nucleus. The loading protocol was: 10 N (6 h); 150 N (42 h); 10 N (24 h). Half-way the 150 N-phase (24 h), we eliminated the osmotic gradient by adding 26% poly-ethylene glycol to the surrounding fluid. For 62 additional discs, we determined the water content of both nucleus and annulus after 6, 24, 48, or 72 h. The compressive load was initially counterbalanced by the hydrostatic pressure in the nucleus. The load forced 4.3% of the water out of the nucleus, which reduced nucleus pressure by 44(±6)%. Reduction of the osmotic gradient disturbed the equilibrium disc height, and a significant loss of annulus water content was found. Remarkably, pressure and water content of the nucleus pulposus remained unchanged. This shows that annulus water content is important in the response to axial loading. After unloading, in the absence of an osmotic gradient, there was substantial viscoelastic recovery of 53(±11)% of the disc height, without a change in water content. However, for restoration of the nucleus pressure and for full restoration of disc height, restoration of the osmotic gradient was needed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The loads on spine and risk of injury however need to be investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate muscle forces, spinal loads and trunk stability in pull-push tasks in sagittal-symmetric, static upright standing posture. Three hand-held load magnitudes (80, 120 and 160 N) at four elevations (0, 20, 40 and 60 cm to the L5-S1) and 24 force directions covering all pull/push orientations were considered. For this purpose, a musculoskeletal finite element model with kinematics measured earlier were used. Results demonstrated that peak spinal forces occur under inclined pull (lift) at upper elevations but inclined push at the lowermost one. Minimal spinal loads, on the other hand, occurred at and around vertical pull directions. Overall, spinal forces closely followed variations in the net external moment of pull-push forces at the L5-S1. Local lumbar muscles were most active in pulls while global extensor muscles in lifts. The trunk stability margin decreased with load elevation except at and around horizontal push; it peaked under pulls and reached minimum at vertical lifts. It also increased with antagonist activity in muscles and intra-abdominal pressure. Results provide insight into the marked effects of variation in the load orientation and elevation on muscle forces, spinal loads and trunk stability and hence offer help in rehabilitation, performance enhancement training and design of safer workplaces.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective of this study is to provide some robust data to quantify the chest response of post-mortem swine under blast loadings. 7 post-mortem swine (54.5 ± 2.6 kg), placed side-on to the threat and against the ground, were exposed to 5 shock-waves of increasing intensities. Their thorax were instrumented with a piezo-resistive pressure sensor, an accelerometer directly exposed to the shock-wave and a target was mounted on the latter in order to track the chest wall displacement. For incident impulses ranging from 47 kPa ms±2% to 173 kPa ms ±6%, the measured maximum of linear chest wall acceleration (Γmax) goes from 5800 m/s2 ±16% to 41,000 m/s2 ± 8%, with a duration of 0.8 ms. Chest wall displacements ranging from 5 mm ± 20% to 20 mm ± 15%, with a duration of 9 ms, are reached. These reproducible data were used to find simple relations (linear, 2nd and 3rd order polynomials) between the kinematic parameters (plus the viscous criterion) and the incident and reflected impulses. Correlating the new reproducible data with the prediction from the Bowen curves showed a lung injury threshold in terms of Γmax similar to that of Cooper (10,000 m/s2).

At the same time, aquatic environments offer a support to the swimmer with the hydrostatic buoyancy counteracting the effects of gravity. Squat jump is a vertical terrestrial push-off with a maximal lower limb extension limited by the gravity force, which attracts the body to the ground. Following this observation, we characterized the effects of environment (water vs. air) on the mechanical characteristics of the leg push-off. Underwater horizontal wall push-off and vertical on-land squat jumps of two local swimmers were evaluated with force plates, synchronized with a lateral camera. To better understand the resistances of the aquatic movement, a quasi-steady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed. The force-, velocity- and power-time curves presented similarities in both environments corresponding to a proximo-distal joints organization. In water, swimmers developed a three-step explosive rise of force, which the first one mainly related to the initiation of body movement. Drag increase, which was observed from the beginning to the end of the push-off, related to the continuous increase of body velocity with high values of drag coefficient (CD) and frontal areas before take-off. Specifically, with velocity, frontal area was the main drag component to explain inter-individual differences, suggesting that the streamlined position of the lower limbs is decisive to perform an efficient push-off.

High levels of knee laxity as assessed during routine clinical exams are associated with first-time ligament injury and graft reinjury following reconstruction. During laxity exams, ligaments carry force to resist the applied load; however, relationships between intersubject variations in knee laxity and variations in how ligaments carry force as the knee moves through its passive envelope of motion, which we refer to as ligament engagement, are not well established. Thus, the objectives of this study were, first, to define parameters describing ligament engagement and, then, to link variations in ligament engagement and variations in laxity across a group of knees. We used a robotic manipulator in a cadaveric knee model (n=20) to quantify how important knee stabilizers, namely the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL, respectively), as well as the medial collateral ligament (MCL) engage during respective tests of anterior, posterior, and valgus laxity. Ligament engagement was quantified using three parameters: (1) in situ slack, defined as the relative tibiofemoral motion from the neutral position of the joint to the position where the ligament began to carry force; (2) in situ stiffness, defined as the slope of the linear portion of the ligament force-tibial motion response; and (3) ligament force at the peak applied load. Knee laxity was related to parameters of ligament engagement using univariate and multivariate regression models. Variations in the in situ slack of the ACL and PCL predicted anterior and posterior laxity, while variations in both in situ slack and in situ stiffness of the MCL predicted valgus laxity. Parameters of ligament engagement may be useful to further characterize the in situ biomechanical function of ligaments and ligament grafts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Skipping presents such an alternative, incorporating double support, flight, and single support phases. We used ground reaction forces (GRFs), lower extremity joint torques and powers to compare skipping and running in 20 healthy adults. The two consecutive skipping steps on each limb differed significantly from each other, and from running. Running had the longest step length, the highest peak vertical GRF, peak knee extensor torque, and peak knee negative and positive power and negative and positive work. Skipping had the greater cadence, peak horizontal GRF, peak hip and ankle extensor torques, peak ankle negative power and work, and peak ankle positive power. The second vs first skipping step had the shorter step length, higher cadence, peak horizontal GRF, peak ankle extensor torque, and peak ankle negative power, negative work, and positive power and positive work. The first skipping step utilized predominately net negative joint work (eccentric muscle action) while the second utilized predominately net positive joint work (concentric muscle action). The skipping data further highlight the persistence of net negative work performed at the knee and net positive work performed at the ankle across locomotion gaits. Evidence of step segregation was seen in distribution of the braking and propelling impulses and net work produced across the hip, knee, and ankle joints.

The objective of this study was to better understand agility strategy by identifying biomechanical metrics that were sensitive to performance speed, which were calculated with data from an array of body-worn inertial sensors. Five metrics were defined (normalized number of foot contacts, stride length variance, arm swing variance, mean normalized stride frequency, and number of body rotations) that corresponded to agility terms defined by experts working in athletic, clinical, and military environments. Eighteen participants donned 13 sensors to complete a reactive agility task, which involved navigating a set of cones in response to a vocal cue. Participants were grouped into fast, medium, and slow performance based on their completion time. Participants in the fast group had the smallest number of foot contacts (normalizing by height), highest stride length variance (normalizing by height), highest forearm angular velocity variance, and highest stride frequency (normalizing by height). The number of body rotations was not sensitive to speed and may have been determined by hand and foot dominance while completing the agility task. The results of this study have the potential to inform the development of a composite agility score constructed from the list of significant metrics. By quantifying the agility terms previously defined by expert evaluators through an agility score, this study can assist in strategy development for training and rehabilitation across athletic, clinical, and military domains.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A mechanistic multi-scale numerical approach is introduced to quantify diffuse axonal injury (DAI), the most important mechanism of TBI, induced by a mechanical insult at micro-scale regions of the white matter or voxels where fiber orientations are the same. Using the mechanical properties of a single axon with a viscoelastic constitutive relation and its functional failure in terms of electrophysiological impairment, a numerical 2D micro-level lattice method is implemented to directly analyze the percentage of injured axons in a voxel containing a bundle of axons all with the same orientation under biaxial stretches. Reference micro-injury maps are then developed with the input parameters based on the principal strain or stretch values and their direction with respect to axons, which provide the percentage of injured axons in the voxel of interest as the output. The methodology is independent of any statistical analyses of the accident data and medical reports to derive probabilistic injury risk curves for DAI. Avoiding a structurally detailed full finite element head model, this study proposes a micro-mechanical approach which considers the anatomical structure of neural axons in the white matter together with their mechanical properties using a numerical lattice method to analyze the brain's diffuse axonal injury.

Thirty healthy subjects performed a seated balance test under three conditions: eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), and eyes closed with vibration to the lumbar muscles (VIB). Each subject performed three trials of each condition on three different visits. The seated balance test utilized a torque-controlled robotic seat, which together with a sitting subject resulted in a physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) (two degrees-of-freedom with upper and lower body rotations). Subjects balanced the pHRI by controlling trunk rotation in response to pseudorandom torque perturbations applied to the seat in the coronal plane. Performance error was expressed as the root mean square (RMSE) of deviations from the upright position in the time domain and as the mean bandpass signal energy (Emb) in the frequency domain. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) quantified the between-visit reliability of both RMSE and Emb. The empirical transfer function estimates (ETFE) from the perturbation input to each of the two rotational outputs were calculated. Coefficients of multiple correlation (CMC) quantified the within- and between-visit reliability of the averaged ETFE. ICCs of RMSE and Emb for all conditions were ≥0.84. The mean within- and between-visit CMCs were all ≥0.96 for the lower body rotation and ≥0.89 for the upper body rotation.

Malformed valves are found in several forms of primary lymphœdema, resulting in incurable swelling of the tissues and immune dysfunction. Their experimental study is complicated by their small size and operation in low pressure and low Reynolds number environments. Mathematical models of these structures can give insight and complement experimentation. In this work, we present the first valve geometry reconstructed from confocal imagery and used in the construction of a subject-specific model in a closing mode. A framework is proposed whereby an image is converted into a valve model. An FEA study was performed to identify the significance of the shear modulus, the consequences of smoothing the leaflet surface and the effect of wall motion on valve behaviour. Smoothing is inherent to any analysis from imagery. The nature of the image, segmentation and meshing all cause attenuation of high-frequency features. Smoothing not only causes loss of surface area but also the loss of high-frequency geometric features which may reduce stiffness. This work aimed to consider these effects and inform studies by taking a manual reconstruction and through manifold harmonic analysis, attenuating higher frequency features to replicate lower resolution images or lower degree-of-freedom reconstructions. In conclusion, two metrics were considered: trans-valvular pressure required to close the valve, ΔPc, and the retrograde volume displacement after closure. The higher ΔPc, the greater the volume of lymph that will pass through the valve during closure. Retrograde volume displacement after closure gives a metric of compliance of the valve and for the quality of the valve seal. In the case of the image-specific reconstructed valve, removing features with a wavelength longer than four μm caused changes in ΔPc. Varying the shear modulus from 10 kPa to 60 kPa caused a 3.85-fold increase in the retrograde volume displaced. The inclusion of a non-rigid wall caused ΔPc to increase from 1.56 to 2.52 cmH2O.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Little is known about the physiologic processes within a BML, although BMLs are associated with mechanical stress, bone tissue microdamage and increased bone remodeling. Here we establish a rabbit model to study the pathophysiology of BMLs. We hypothesized that in vivo loads that generate microdamage in cancellous bone would also create BMLs and increase bone remodeling. In vivo cyclic loading (0.2-2.0 MPa in compression for 10,000 cycles at 2 Hz) was applied to epiphyseal cancellous bone in the distal femurs of New Zealand white rabbits (n=3, right limb loaded, left limb controls experienced surgery but no loading). Magnetic resonance images were collected using short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1 weighted sequences at 1 and 2 weeks after surgery/loading and histological analysis of the BML was performed after euthanasia to examine tissue microdamage and remodeling. Loaded limbs displayed BMLs while control limbs showed only a small BML-like signal caused by surgery. Histological analysis of the BML at 2 weeks after loading showed increased tissue microdamage (p=0.03) and bone resorption (p=0.01) as compared to controls.

Absolute errors in peak moments (Nm) ranged from 17.7 to 16.4, 16.9 and 49.3 Nm, for IMC setup's with 17, 8, 6 and 4 sensors, respectively. When horizontal GRF were neglected for 6 sensors, RMSerrors and peak moment errors decreased from 22 to 17.3 and from 16.9 to 13 Nm, respectively. In conclusion, while reasonable moment estimates can be obtained with 6 sensors, omitting the forearm sensors led to unacceptable errors. Furthermore, vertical GRF information is sufficient to estimate L5S1 moments in lifting.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In a tissue engineering framework, this stimulus has also been considered as a mechanical regulator of stem cell differentiation. We recently demonstrated that the fluid-oscillating effect in combination with a physiologically-relevant shear stress magnitude contributes to the formation of stem cell-derived de novo heart valve tissues. However, the range of oscillations necessary to induce favorable gene expression and engineered tissue formation is unknown. In this study, we took a computational approach to establish a range of oscillatory shear stresses that may optimize in vitro valvular tissue growth. Taking a biomimetic approach, three physiologically-relevant flow waveforms from the human: (i) aorta, (ii) pulmonary artery and (iii) superior vena cava were utilized to simulate pulsatile flow conditions within a bioreactor that housed 3 tissue specimens. Results were compared to non-physiological pulsatile flow (NPPF) and cyclic flexure-steady flow (Flex-Flow) conditions. The oscillatory shear index (OSI) was used to quantify the fluid-induced oscillations occurring on the specimen surfaces. The range of mean OSI under the physiological conditions investigated was found to be 0.18 ≤ OSI ≤ 0.23. On the other hand, NPPF and Flex-Flow environments yielded a mean OSI of 0.37 and 0.11 respectively, which were 46% higher and 45% lower than physiological conditions. Moreover, we subsequently conducted OSI-based human bone marrow stem cell (HBMSC) culture experiments which resulted in preferential valvular gene expression and phenotype (significant upregulation of BMP, KLF2A, CD31 and α-SMA using an OSI of 0.23 in comparison to a lower OSI of 0.10 or a higher OSI of 0.38; p < .05). These findings suggest that a distinct range or a ""sweet-spot"" for physiological OSI exists in the mechanical conditioning of tissue engineered heart valves grown from stem cell sources. We conclude that in vitro heart valve matrix development could be further enhanced by simultaneous exposure of the engineered tissues to physiologically-relevant magnitudes of both fluid-induced oscillations and shear stresses.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Atherosclerotic plaques and aneurysms are expected to involve focal changes in vessel wall properties; therefore, a method to image the stiffness variation would be a valuable clinical tool. The pulse wave inverse problem (PWIP) fits unknown parameters from a computational model of arterial pulse wave propagation to ultrasound-based measurements of vessel wall displacements by minimizing the difference between the model and measured displacements. The PWIP has been validated in phantoms, and this study presents the first in vivo demonstration. The common carotid arteries of five healthy volunteers were imaged five times in a single session with repositioning of the probe and subject between each scan. The 1D finite difference computational model used in the PWIP spanned from the start of the transducer to the carotid bifurcation, where a resistance outlet boundary condition was applied to approximately model the downstream reflection of the pulse wave. Unknown parameters that were estimated by the PWIP included a 10-segment linear piecewise compliance distribution and 16 discrete cosine transformation coefficients for each of the inlet boundary conditions. Input data was selected to include pulse waves resulting from the primary pulse and dicrotic notch. The recovered compliance maps indicate that the compliance increases close to the bifurcation, and the variability of the average pulse wave velocity estimated through the PWIP is on the order of 11%, which is similar to that of the conventional processing technique which tracks the wavefront arrival time (13%).",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the present study, the size-dependent nonlinear vibrations of axially loaded lipid micro/nano tubules associated with the both prebuckling and postbuckling domains are explored comprehensively. To accomplish this purpose, the nonlocal strain gradient theory of elasticity including simultaneously two entirely different features of size dependency is utilized within the framework of the third-order shear deformable beam model. With the aid of Hamilton's principle, the non-classical governing differential equations of motion are established incorporating the nonlinear prebuckling deformations and the large postbuckling deflections. At the end, the Galerkin method in conjunction with an improved perturbation technique is employed to initiate explicit analytical expressions for nonlocal strain gradient nonlinear frequency of pre- and post-buckled lipid micro/nano-tubules. It is seen that by taking the nonlocal size effect into consideration, the influence of geometrical parameters of the lipid micro/nano-tubule on the nonlinear vibration characteristics within the both prebuckling and postbuckling domains decreases and the frequency-deflection curves are more close to each other. However, the strain gradient size dependency has an opposite effect and leads to increase the gap between the frequency-deflection curves of axially compressed lipid micro/nano-tubules with different geometrical parameters.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the medial-lateral components of ground reaction force and leg length have been neglected in current leg stiffness formulations. It is unknown if accounting for all 3D would alter healthy biologic estimates of leg stiffness, compared to present direct modelling methods. This study compared running leg stiffness derived from a new method (multiplanar method) which includes all three Cartesian axes, against current methods which either only include the vertical axis (line method) or only the plane of progression (uniplanar method). Twenty healthy female runners performed shod overground running at 5.0 m/s. Three-dimensional motion capture and synchronised in-ground force plates were used to track the change in length of the leg vector (hip joint centre to centre of pressure) and resultant projected ground reaction force. Leg stiffness was expressed as dimensionless units, as a percentage of an individual's bodyweight divided by standing leg length (BW/LL). Leg stiffness using the line method was larger than the uniplanar method by 15.6%BW/LL (P < .001), and multiplanar method by 24.2%BW/LL (P < .001). Leg stiffness from the uniplanar method was larger than the multiplanar method by 8.5%BW/LL (6.5 kN/m) (P < .001). The inclusion of medial-lateral components significantly increased leg deformation magnitude, accounting for the reduction in leg stiffness estimate with the multiplanar method. Given that limb movements typically occur in 3D, the new multiplanar method provides the most complete accounting of all force and length components in leg stiffness calculation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

During standard loading of rat tail tendon (RTT) fascicles, apparent axial twist has been observed. To quantify this behavior, we designed a custom testing setup, utilizing magnetic suspension, to allow unconstrained axial rotation during tensile loading. We characterized the rotational behavior of single and paired RTT fascicles under cyclic loading. We also measured stress relaxation across loading cycles as well as ""rotational relaxation"". Single fascicle nonlinear stretch-twist coupling is well described by the asymptotic function Δθ=A(1-e-Bε) in which fascicles rotated a mean ±51.1° within about 1% applied axial strain. On average, paired fascicles rotated just over 10° less. Specimen cross-sectional diameter had a noticeable effect on the measured mechanical properties, particularly effective elastic modulus. Such stretch-twist coupling and size dependence cannot be understood via classical elasticity but is predicted by Cosserat (micropolar) elasticity. The current study demonstrates RTT fascicles are chiral based on observed axial load-induced twist. Additionally, our findings support existing research that suggests a helical fascicle structure.

Considering the frequent access of elderly patients to this surgical practice, tissue degradation phenomena must be investigated, since they could affect treatment reliability and durability. The potential degradation can be interpreted considering a variation within soft tissue constitutive formulation, by means of a correlation between mechanical properties and tissues ageing. The overall compressibility varies, as characteristics aspect of soft tissue mechanical response with age, as well as the stiffness. The investigation is performed by means of a three dimensional numerical model of the urethral duct. The effects of the interaction phenomenon with a cuff is interpreted considering the changes, within the constitutive models, of the basic parameters that define the potential degradation process. The deformation related to compressibility is recalled, ranging between ten and fifty percent in dependence on the degradation level considered.

Despite the well-documented clinical utility of HVPG, it remains poorly understood how the relationship between HVPG and PPG is affected by factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of cirrhosis. In the study, a computational model of the hepatic circulation calibrated to in vivo data was developed to simulate the procedure of HVPG measurement and quantitatively investigate the error of HVPG relative to PPG under various pathophysiological conditions. Obtained results confirmed the clinical consensus that HVPG is applicable to the assessment of portal hypertension caused by increased vascular resistance located primarily at the sinusoidal and postsinusoidal sites rather than at the presinusoidal site. On the other hand, our study demonstrated that the accuracy of HVPG measurement was influenced by many factors related to hepatic hemodynamics even in the case of sinusoidal portal hypertension. For instance, varying presinusoidal portal vascular resistance significantly altered the difference between HVPG and PPG, while an enhancement in portosystemic collateral flow tended to improve the accuracy of HVPG measurement. Moreover, it was found that presinusoidal and postsinusoidal vascular resistances interfered with each other with respect to their influence on HVPG measurement. These findings suggest that one should take into account patient-specific pathological conditions in order to achieve a better understanding and utilization of HVPG in the clinical practice.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

AFOs influence joint motion and metabolic cost, but how they impact muscle function remains unclear. This study investigated the impact of different stiffness AFOs on medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) and Achilles tendon (AT) function during two walking speeds. We performed gait analyses for eight unimpaired individuals. Each individual walked at slow and very slow speeds with a 3D printed AFO with no resistance (free hinge condition) and four levels of ankle dorsiflexion stiffness: 0.25Nm/°, 1Nm/°, 2Nm/°, and 3.7Nm/°. Motion capture, ultrasound, and musculoskeletal modeling were used to quantify MG and AT lengths with each AFO condition. Increasing AFO stiffness increased peak AFO dorsiflexion moment with decreased peak knee extension and peak ankle dorsiflexion angles. Overall musculotendon length and peak AT length decreased, while peak MG length increased with increasing AFO stiffness. Peak MG activity, length, and velocity significantly decreased with slower walking speed.

Continuum mechanics modeling of the mechanical response of such tissues using transversely isotropic hyperelasticity is now well developed. The fundamental deformation of simple shear within this framework is examined here. It is well known that the normal stress effect characteristic of nonlinear elasticity plays a crucial role in maintaining a homogeneous deformation state in the bulk of the specimen. Here we consider the effect of anisotropy and fiber-orientation on the shear and normal stresses. It is shown that the confining traction that needs to be applied to the top and bottom faces of a block in order to maintain simple shear can be compressive or tensile depending on the degree of anisotropy and on the angle of orientation of the fibers. In the absence of such an applied traction, an unconfined sample tends to bulge outwards or contract inwards perpendicular to the direction of shear so that one has the possibility of both a positive or negative Poynting effect. The results are illustrated using experimental data obtained by other authors for porcine brain white matter. The general results obtained here are relevant to the development of accurate shear test protocols for the determination of constitutive properties of fibrous biological soft tissues.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

ISA is more prominent in complex arterial geometries, such as curvature, asa result of the limited conformability of coronary stents. These malapposed struts disturb the otherwise near-wall laminar blood flow and form a micro-recirculation environment. The micro-recirculation environment is often associated with low wall shear stress (WSS) and upsets the delicate balance of vascular biology, providing possible nidus for thrombosis and restenosis. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) stent model was virtually deployed into an idealised curved coronary artery. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out to systematically analyse the haemodynamic effects of increasing maximum ISA distances, ranging from 180 (moderate), 400 (intermediate) to 910μm (severe) in an artery with decreasing radius of curvature (ROC). Micro-recirculations around both proximal and distal malapposed struts become more pronounced as compared to fully-apposed struts. The accompanying areas of low temporally-averaged WSS (AL-TAWSS) can increase twofold compared to the fully-apposed condition. Furthermore, substantial regions (∼5.2% and 9.0%) of AL-TAWSS are detached from the distal end of the malapposed struts in both moderate and intermediate cases respectively. Malapposed stents also induce more variation of TAWSS at the inner bend of the artery. At the stent surface, maximum WSS increases threefold from the fully-apposed case to intermediate ISA. High WSS on the strut surface is known to activate platelets which when exposed to the micro-recirculation environment may lead to their deposition and thrombosis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A finite element model of the spine within an optimization procedure was used to estimate segmental kinematics of lumbar spine associated with five different sets of TMFs. Each set of TMFs was associated with a hypothetical trunk neuromuscular strategy that optimized one aspect of lower back biomechanics. For each set of TMFs, the segmental kinematics of lumbar spine was estimated for a single static trunk flexed posture involving, respectively, 40° and 10° of thoracic and pelvic rotations. Minimum changes in the angular and translational deformations of a motion segment with alterations in TMFs ranged from 0° to 0.7° and 0 mm to 0.04 mm, respectively.

This study aimed to characterize macroscopic anisotropic cortical bone material properties and investigate relationships with bone density measures in children with severe OI. Specimens were obtained from tibial or femoral shafts of nine children with severe OI and five controls. The specimens were cut into beams, characterized in bending, and imaged by synchrotron radiation X-ray micro-computed tomography. Longitudinal modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and bending strength were 32-65% lower in the OI group (p<0.001). Yield strain did not differ between groups (p≥0.197). In both groups, modulus and strength were lower in the transverse direction (p≤0.009), but anisotropy was less pronounced in the OI group. Intracortical vascular porosity was almost six times higher in the OI group (p<0.001), but no differences were observed in osteocyte lacunar porosity between the groups (p=0.086). Volumetric bone mineral density was lower in the OI group (p<0.001), but volumetric tissue mineral density was not (p=0.770). Longitudinal OI bone modulus and strength were correlated with volumetric bone mineral density (p≤0.024) but not volumetric tissue mineral density (p≥0.099).

Fascicle length is often estimated using linear trigonometry to extrapolate fascicle length to regions where the fascicle is not visible. However, this approach has not been compared to measurements made with a larger field of view for dynamic muscle contractions. Here we compared two different single-transducer extrapolation methods to measure VL muscle fascicle length to a direct measurement made using two synchronised, in-series transducers. The first method used pennation angle and muscle thickness to extrapolate fascicle length outside the image (extrapolate method). The second method determined fascicle length based on the extrapolated intercept between a fascicle and the aponeurosis (intercept method). Nine participants performed maximal effort, isometric, knee extension contractions on a dynamometer at 10° increments from 50 to 100° of knee flexion. Fascicle length and torque were simultaneously recorded for offline analysis. The dual transducer method showed similar patterns of fascicle length change (overall mean coefficient of multiple correlation was 0.76 and 0.71 compared to extrapolate and intercept methods respectively), but reached different absolute lengths during the contractions. This had the effect of producing force-length curves of the same shape, but each curve was shifted in terms of absolute length. We concluded that dual transducers are beneficial for studies that examine absolute fascicle lengths, whereas either of the single transducer methods may produce similar results for normalised length changes, and repeated measures experimental designs.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

These processes are disrupted in the chondrocytes of cartilage during joint disease. A key driver of cellular mechanotransduction is the stiffness of the surrounding matrix. Many cells are surrounded by extracellular matrix that allows for tissue mechanical function. Although prior studies demonstrate that extracellular stiffness is important in cell differentiation, morphology and phenotype, it remains largely unknown how a cell's biological response to cyclical loading varies with changes in surrounding substrate stiffness. Understanding these processes is important for understanding cells that are cyclically loaded during daily in vivo activities (e.g. chondrocytes and walking). This study uses high-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry to identify metabolomic changes in primary chondrocytes under cyclical compression for 0-30minutes in low- and high-stiffness environments. Metabolomic analysis reveals metabolites and pathways that are sensitive to substrate stiffness, duration of cyclical compression, and a combination of both suggesting changes in extracellular stiffness in vivo alter mechanosensitive signaling. Our results further suggest that cyclical loading minimizes matrix deterioration and increases matrix production in chondrocytes.

To address this knowledge gap, we studied how local strain and construct buckling in human TE constructs changes over culture times and GAG content. Confocal elastography techniques and digital image correlation (DIC) were used to measure and record buckling modes and local strains. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to quantify construct buckling. The results from the ROC analysis were placed into Kaplan-Meier survival function curves to establish the probability that any point in a construct buckled. These analysis techniques revealed the presence of buckling at early time points, but bending at later time points. An inverse correlation was observed between the probability of buckling and the total GAG content of each construct. This data suggests that increased GAG content prevents the onset of construct buckling and improves the microscale compressive tissue properties. This increase in GAG deposition leads to enhanced global compressive properties by prevention of microscale buckling.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While in vitro tests with pure moments suggest larger intra-segmental rotations for the more caudal segments, in vivo results show diverging motion distributions. The present study analysed the motion distribution in vivo of 320 asymptomatic subjects. The change of the back curvature between standing and upper body flexion was determined using a non-invasive measurement device. Linear, bilinear, trilinear, quadratic, and cubic regression models were fitted to the segmental motion distribution over the lengths of the lordosis to categorise characteristic motion patterns. Simplicity and approximation quality were used to assign the motion distributions to the regression models. Seventy-seven percent of the motion distributions could be explained by a bilinear model. A further 12% and 11% could be represented by a trilinear and linear model, respectively. Less than 1% of the distributions could not satisfactorily be represented by the models. All of the bilinear models displayed maximum flexion in approximately the middle of lordosis. All linear models showed a decreasing rotation from caudal to cranial. Most of the trilinear models displayed a distribution similar to the bilinear. Age, sex, body height, and weight did not significantly affect these distributions. This in vivo study identified characteristic motion patterns in the lumbar spine during flexion. The quantitative results provide a clear description of the healthy condition and may serve to identify spinal motion abnormalities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The simplest passive dynamic walker model comprising of two massless legs connected by a frictionless hinge joint at the hip was adopted to generate walking time series. The generated time series was used to construct a state space with the embedding dimension of 3 and time delay of 100 samples. The LyE was calculated as the exponential rate of divergence of neighboring trajectories of the state space using Rosenstein's algorithm. To determine the effect of noise on LyE values, seven levels of Gaussian white noise (SNR=55-25dB with 5dB steps) were added to the time series. In addition, the filtering was performed using a range of cutoff frequencies from 3Hz to 19Hz with 2Hz steps. The LyE was calculated for both noise-free and noisy time series with different lengths of 6, 50, 100 and 150 strides. Results demonstrated a high percent error in the presence of noise for LyE. Therefore, these observations suggest that Rosenstein's algorithm might not perform well in the presence of added experimental noise. Furthermore, findings indicated that at least 50 walking strides are required to calculate LyE to account for the effect of noise. Finally, observations support that a conservative filtering of the time series with a high cutoff frequency might be more appropriate prior to calculating LyE.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this work was to develop and implement a standardized testing protocol across three six-axis spine systems, compare them, and provide stiffness and phase angle limits against which other test systems can be compared. Standardized synthetic lumbar specimens (n=5), comprising three springs embedded in polymer at each end, were tested on each system using pure moments in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Tests were performed using sine and triangle waves with an amplitude of 8Nm, a frequency of 0.1Hz, and with axial preloads of 0 and 500N. The stiffness, phase angle, and R2 value of the moment against rotation in the principal axis were calculated at the center of each specimen. The tracking error was adopted asa measure of each test system to minimize non-principal loads, defined as the root mean squared difference between actual and target loads. All three test systems demonstrated similar stiffnesses, with small (<14%) but significant differences in 4 of 12 tests. More variability was observed in the phase angle between the principal axis moment and rotation, with significant differences in 10 of 12 tests. Stiffness and phase angle limits were calculated based on the 95% confidence intervals from all three systems. These recommendations can be used with the standard specimen and testing protocol by other research institutions to ensure equivalence of different spine systems, increasing the ability to compare in vitro spine studies.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to estimate the spinal loads (T12-S1) and trunk muscles forces during a complete gait cycle. Six men, 24-33years walk barefoot at self-selected speed (4-5km/h). 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded using a motion capturing system and two force plates, implemented in an inverse dynamic musculoskeletal model to predict the spinal loads and trunk muscles forces. Additionally, the sensitivity of the intra-abdominal pressure and lumbar segment rotational stiffness was investigated. Peak spinal loads and trunk muscle forces were between the gait instances of heel strike and toe off.

The proposed method is based on variational data assimilation using a mechanical tongue model and 3D tongue surface shapes for speech production. The mechanical tongue model considers nonlinear hyperelasticity, finite deformation, actual geometry from computed tomography (CT) images, and anisotropic active contraction by muscle fibers, the orientations of which are ideally determined using anatomical drawings. The tongue deformation is obtained by solving a stationary force-equilibrium equation using a finite element method. An inverse problem is established to find the combination of muscle contraction stresses that minimizes the Euclidean distance of the tongue surfaces between the mechanical analysis and CT results of speech production, where a signed-distance function represents the tongue surface. Our approach is validated through an ideal numerical example and extended to the real-world case of two Japanese vowels, /ʉ/ and /ɯ/. The results capture the target shape completely and provide an excellent estimation of the active contraction stresses in the ideal case, and exhibit similar tendencies as in previous observations and simulations for the actual vowel cases. The present approach can reveal the relative relationship among the muscle contraction stresses in similar utterances with different tongue shapes, and enables the investigation of the coordination of tongue muscles during speech using only the deformed tongue shape obtained from medical images. This will enhance our understanding of speech motor control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The proposed method is based on the ground reaction and joint moment regressor matrices, developed initially in robotics system identification theory, and involved in the equations of motion of the human body. The regressor matrices are linear relatively to the segment inertial parameters allowing us to use simple sensitivity analysis methods. The sensitivity analysis method was applied over gait dynamics and kinematics data of nine subjects and with a 15 segments 3D model of the locomotor apparatus. According to the proposed sensitivity indices, 76 segments inertial parameters out the 150 of the mechanical model were considered as not influent for gait. The main findings were that the segment masses were influent and that, at the exception of the trunk, moment of inertia were not influent for the computation of the ground reaction forces and moments and the joint moments. The same method also shows numerically that at least 90% of the lower-limb joint moments during the stance phase can be estimated only from a force-plate and kinematics data without knowing any of the segment inertial parameters.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in synergies relate to changes in gait while walking on a treadmill at multiple speeds and slopes. The hypothesis was that significant changes in movement pattern would not be accompanied by significant changes in synergies, suggesting that synergies are not dependent on the mechanical constraints but are instead neurological in origin.


METHODS
Sixteen typically developing children walked on a treadmill for nine combinations (stages) of different speeds and slopes while simultaneously collecting kinematics, kinetics, and surface electromyography (EMG) data. The kinematics for each stride were summarized using a modified version of the Gait Deviation Index that only includes the sagittal plane. The kinetics for each stride were summarized using a modified version of the Gait Deviation Index - Kinetic which includes sagittal plane moments and powers. Within each synergy group, the correlations of the synergies were calculated between the treadmill stages.


RESULTS
While kinematics and kinetics were significantly altered at the highest slope compared to level ground when walking on a treadmill, synergies were similar across stages.


CONCLUSIONS
The high correlations between synergies across stages indicate that neuromuscular control strategies do not change as children walk at different speeds and slopes on a treadmill. However, the multiple significant differences in kinematics and kinetics between stages indicate real differences in movement pattern. This supports the theory that synergies are neurological in origin and not simply a response to the biomechanical task constraints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Under mechanical stimuli, such as viscous flow or forces induced by motor rotation, the filament changes its phase from left-handed normal (N) to right-handed semi-coiled (SC) via phase nucleation and growth. Our detailed mechanical analysis of existing experiments shows that both torque and bending moment contribute to the filament phase transition. In this paper, we establish a non-convex and non-local continuum model based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory to describe main characteristics of the filament phase transition such as new-phase nucleation, growth, propagation and the merging of neighboring interfaces. The finite element method (FEM) is adopted to simulate the phase transition under a displacement-controlled loading condition (rotation angle and bending deflection). We show that new-phase nucleation corresponds to the maximum torque and bending moment at the stuck end of the filament. The hysteresis loop in the loading and unloading curves indicates energy dissipation. When the new phase grows and propagates, torque and bending moment remain static. We also find that there is a drop in load when the two interfaces merge, indicating a concomitant reduction in the interfacial energy. Finally, the interface thickness is governed by the coefficients of the gradient of order parameters in the non-local interface energy. Our continuum theory and the finite element method provide a method to study the mechanical behavior of such biomaterials.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The goal of this study was to assess the correspondence between IDP and bone density in the adjacent vertebrae, with emphasis on how this correspondence differs between healthy and degenerated IVDs. Bone density of the endplates and subchondral bone in regions adjacent to the anterior and posterior annulus fibrosus (aAF and pAF, respectively) and nucleus pulposus (NP) was measured via quantitative computed tomography (QCT) in 61 spine segments (T7-9, T9-11, T10-12; 71±14years). IDP was measured in the aAF, NP, and pAF regions in 26 of the spine segments (68±16years) while they were tested in flexed (5°) or erect postures. Disc degeneration was assessed by multiple grading schemes. No correlation was found between bone density and IDP in either posture (p>0.104). Regional variations in IDP and, to a greater extent bone density, were found to change with advancing degeneration: both IDP (p=0.045) and bone density (p=0.024) decreased in the NP region relative to the aAF region. The finding of only a modest correspondence between degeneration-associated changes in IDP and bone density may arise from complexity in how IDP relates to mechanical force transmission through the endplate and from limitations of the available IVD grading schemes in estimating the mechanical behavior of the IVD.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty elite (10F, 26.4±3.5yrs) and 20 recreational (10F, 24.8±2.4yrs) athletes used an isolated leg to maximally compress a slender spring designed to buckle at low forces while seated. The foot forces during the compression at the edge of instability quantify the maximal sensorimotor ability to control dynamic foot-ground interactions. Using the nonlinear analysis technique of attractor reconstruction, we characterized the spatial (interquartile range IQR) and geometric (trajectory length TL, volume V, and sum of edge lengths SE) features of the dynamical behavior of those force time series. ANOVA confirmed the already published effect of sex, and a new effect of athletic ability, respectively, in TL (p=0.014 and p<0.001), IQR (p=0.008 and p<0.001), V (p=0.034 and p=0.002), and SE (p=0.033 and p<0.001).

Importantly, sex differences disappeared in elite athletes. These results provide an empirical link between sex, athletic ability, and nonlinear dynamical control. This is a first step in understanding the sensorimotor mechanisms for control of unstable foot-ground interactions. Given that females suffer a greater incidence of non-contact knee ligament injuries, these non-invasive and practical metrics of leg dexterity may be both indicators of athletic ability, and predictors of risk of injury.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, the objective of this study is to present a verified three dimensional inverse skater model with minimal complexity, which models the speed skating motion on the straights. The model simulates the upper body transverse translation of the skater together with the forces exerted by the skates on the ice. The input of the model is the changing distance between the upper body and the skate, referred to as the leg extension (Euclidean distance in 3D space). Verification shows that the model mimics the observed forces and motions well. The model is most accurate for the position and velocity estimation (respectively 1.2% and 2.9% maximum residuals) and least accurate for the force estimations (underestimation of 4.5-10%). The model can be used to further investigate variables in the skating motion.

In vivo investigations with a telemeterized vertebral body replacement showed that spinal loads can be affected by differences in arm positions during sitting and standing. However, little is known about how arm swing could influence the lumbar spine and hip joint forces and motions during walking. The present study aims to provide better understanding of the contribution of the upper limbs to human gait, investigating ranges of motion and joint reaction forces. A three-dimensional motion analysis was carried out via a motion capturing system on six healthy males and five patients with hip instrumented implant. Each subject performed walking with different arm swing amplitudes (small, normal, and large) and arm positions (bound to the body, and folded across the chest). The motion data were imported in a commercial musculoskeletal analysis software for kinematic and inverse dynamic investigation. The range of motion of the thorax with respect to the pelvis and of the pelvis with respect to the ground in the transversal plane were significantly associated with arm position and swing amplitude during gait. The hip external-internal rotation range of motion statistically varied only for non-dominant limb. Unlike hip joint reaction forces, predicted peak spinal loads at T12-L1 and L5-S1 showed significant differences at approximately the time of contralateral toe off and contralateral heel strike.

These devices mechanically force the mandible forward to apply traction force to the mandibular condyle. This promotes cartilaginous growth in the small mandible. However, no studies have clarified how much traction force is applied to the mandibular condyle. Moreover, it remains unknown as to how anatomical characteristics affect this traction force. Therefore, in this study, we developed a device for measuring the amount of force generated while individual patients wore functional appliances, and we investigated the relationship between forces with structures surrounding the mandibular condyle. We compared traction force values with cone-beam computed tomography image data in eight subjects. The functional appliance resulted in a traction force of 339-1477gf/mm, with a mean value of 196.5gf/mm for the elastic modulus of the mandible. A comparison with cone-beam computed tomography image data suggested that the mandibular traction force was affected by the mandibular condyle and shape of the articular eminence.

The impact of these alterations on the accuracy of the estimated joint contact forces were appraised. The systematic search yielded to 141 articles and 24 papers were included in the review. Different strategies of alterations were found: skeletal and joint model (e.g. number of degrees of freedom, knee alignment), muscle model (e.g. Hill-type muscle parameters, level of muscular redundancy), and optimisation problem (e.g. objective function, design variables, constraints). All these alterations had an impact on joint contact force accuracy, so demonstrating the potential for improving the model predictions without necessarily involving costly and time consuming medical images.

Continuum models closer approximate the anatomy, and facilitate ligament wrapping, while spring models are computationally less expensive. The mechanical properties of ligaments can be based on literature, or adjusted specifically for the subject. In the current study we investigated the effect of ligament modelling strategy on the predictive capability of FE models of the human knee joint. The effect of literature-based versus specimen-specific optimized material parameters was evaluated. Experiments were performed on three human cadaver knees, which were modelled in FE models with ligaments represented either using springs, or using continuum representations. In spring representation collateral ligaments were each modelled with three and cruciate ligaments with two single-element bundles. Stiffness parameters and pre-strains were optimized based on laxity tests for both approaches. Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the outcomes of the FE models. Models (both spring and continuum) with subject-specific properties improved the predicted kinematics and contact outcome parameters. Models incorporating literature-based parameters, and particularly the spring models (with the representations implemented in this study), led to relatively high errors in kinematics and contact pressures. Using a continuum modelling approach resulted in more accurate contact outcome variables than the spring representation with two (cruciate ligaments) and three (collateral ligaments) single-element-bundle representations. However, when the prediction of joint kinematics is of main interest, spring ligament models provide a faster option with acceptable outcome.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The study is based on an open access virtual database generated via simulations. Seven cardiac and arterial parameters were varied within physiological healthy ranges, leading to a total of 3325 virtual healthy subjects. For assessing the model-based ARCSolver method computationally, this method was used to perform WSA based on the aortic root pressure waveforms of the virtual patients. Asa reference, the values of WSA using both the pressure and flow waveforms provided by the virtual database were taken. The investigated parameters showed a good overall agreement between the model-based method and the reference.

The wide range of in silico available and the limited realistic model for the extrathoracic region of the lung have improved understanding of the ultrafine particle transport and deposition (TD) in the upper airways. However, comprehensive ultrafine particle TD data for the real and entire lung model are still unavailable in the literature. Therefore, this study is aimed to provide an understanding of the ultrafine particle TD in the terminal bronchioles for the development of future therapeutics. The Euler-Lagrange (E-L) approach and ANSYS fluent (17.2) solver were used to investigate ultrafine particle TD. The physical conditions of sleeping, resting, and light activity were considered in this modelling study. A comprehensive pressure-drop along five selected path lines in different lobes was calculated. The non-linear behaviour of pressure-drops is observed, which could aid the health risk assessment system for patients with respiratory diseases. Numerical results also showed that ultrafine particle-deposition efficiency (DE) in different lobes is different for various physical activities. Moreover, the numerical results showed hot spots in various locations among the different lobes for different flow rates, which could be helpful for targeted therapeutical aerosol transport to terminal bronchioles and the alveolar region.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

A biceps tenotomy is often performed in the presence of a rotator cuff tear to help reduce pain and improve joint function. However, the effect of this procedure on the surrounding tissues in the glenohumeral joint is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a biceps tenotomy in the presence of a supraspinatus rotator cuff tear followed by overuse activity on ambulatory function and mechanical and histologic properties of the remaining rotator cuff tendons and glenoid cartilage. 46 rats underwent 4weeks of overuse activity to create a tendinopathic condition, then were randomized into two groups: unilateral detachment of the supraspinatus tendon or detachment of the supraspinatus and long head of the biceps tendons. Ambulatory measurements were performed throughout the 8weeks prior to euthanasia, followed by analysis of the properties of the remaining intact tendons and glenoid cartilage. Results demonstrate that shoulder function was not effected in the biceps tenotomy group. However, the intact tendons and glenoid cartilage showed altered mechanical and histologic properties. This study provides evidence from an animal model that does not support the use of tenotomy in the presence of a supraspinatus tendon rotator cuff tear, and provides a framework for physicians to better prescribe long-term treatment strategies for patients.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The use of different study protocols leads to controversy in literature and thus complicates the evaluation of the current literature. The aim of this study consisted in examining the influence of different freezing and thawing temperatures on the mechanical properties of tendons. 60 porcine tendons were frozen at either -80°C or -20°C for 7days and thawed at room or body temperature for 240 or 30min, respectively. A subgroup of ten tendons was quick-frozen with liquid nitrogen (-196°C) for 2s before cryopreservation. Biomechanical testing was performed with a material testing machine and included creep, cyclic and load-to-failure tests. The results showed that freezing leads to a reduced creep strain after constant loading and to an increased secant modulus. Freezing temperature of -80°C increased the secant modulus and decreased the strain at maximum stress, whereas thawing at room temperature reduced the maximum stress, the strain at initial tendon failure and the Young's Modulus. Quick-freezing led to increased creep strain after constant loading, increased strain at initial failure in the load-to-failure test, and decreased strain at maximum stress. When cryopreserving, tendons for scientific or medical reasons, freezing temperature of -20°C and thawing temperature of 37.5°C are recommended to maintain the native properties of tendons. A treatment with liquid nitrogen in the sterilization process of tendon allografts is inadvisable because it alters the tendon properties negatively.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These functions are based on transport phenomena that depend on nasal airflow patterns and turbulence. Accurate prediction of these airflow properties requires careful selection of computational fluid dynamics models and rigorous validation. The validation studies in the past have been limited by poor representations of the complex nasal geometry, lack of detailed airflow comparisons, and restricted ranges of flow rate. The objective of this study is to validate various numerical methods based on an anatomically accurate nasal model against published experimentally measured data under breathing flow rates from 180 to 1100ml/s. The numerical results of velocity profiles and turbulence intensities were obtained using the laminar model, four widely used Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models (i.e., k-ε, standard k-ω, Shear Stress Transport k-ω, and Reynolds Stress Model), large eddy simulation (LES) model, and direct numerical simulation (DNS). It was found that, despite certain irregularity in the flow field, the laminar model achieved good agreement with experimental results under restful breathing condition (180ml/s) and performed better than the RANS models. As the breathing flow rate increased, the RANS models achieved more accurate predictions but still performed worse than LES and DNS. As expected, LES and DNS can provide accurate predictions of the nasal airflow under all flow conditions but have an approximately 100-fold higher computational cost. Among all the RANS models tested, the standard k-ω model agrees most closely with the experimental values in terms of velocity profile and turbulence intensity.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigated the effects of early stages of aging on postural sway using traditional and contemporary postural indices from different domains. Eleven healthy young adults and fourteen healthy non-faller older adults performed two postural tasks: (a) functional limits of stability and (b) unperturbed bipedal stance for 120s. Postural indices from spatial, temporal, frequency, and structural domains were extracted from the body's center of pressure (COP) signals and its Rambling and Trembling components. Results revealed a preservation of functional limits of upright stability in older adults accompanied by larger, faster, and shakier body sway in both anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions; increased medio-lateral sway frequency; increased irregularity of body sway pattern in time in both directions; and increased area, variability, velocity, and jerkiness of both rambling and trembling components of the COP displacement in the anterior-posterior direction (p<0.02). Such changes might be interpreted as compensatory adjustments to the age-related decline of sensory, neural, and motor functions. In conclusion, balance assessment using postural indices from different domains extracted from the COP displacement was able to capture subtle effects of the natural process of aging on the mechanisms of postural control. Our findings suggest the use of such indices as potential markers for postural instability and fall risk in older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study is to identify distinct biomechanical features of dynamic balance during gait that are different between fallers with MS, non-fallers with MS, and healthy controls. 27 recurrent fallers with MS, 28 persons with MS with no falls history, and 27 healthy controls walked on a treadmill at their preferred speed for 3min. The variability of trunk accelerations and the average and variability of minimum toe clearance, spatiotemporal parameters, and margin of stability were compared between groups. Fallers with MS exhibited a slower cautious gait compared to non-fallers and healthy controls, but had decreased anterior-posterior margin of stability and minimum toe clearance. Fallers walked with less locally stable and predictable trunk accelerations, and increased variability of step length, stride time, and both anterior-posterior and mediolateral margin of stability compared to non-fallers and healthy controls. The present work provides evidence that within a group of persons with MS, there are gait differences that are influenced by falls history. These differences indicate that in persons with MS who fall, the center of mass is poorly controlled through base of support placement and the foot is closer to the ground during swing phase relative to the non-fallers. These identified biomechanical differences could be used to evaluate dynamic balance in persons with MS and to help improve fall prevention strategies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that hydrogel injections can mitigate the adverse remodeling due to MI. More importantly, the material properties of these injections influence the efficacy of the therapy. The goal of the current study is to explore the interrelated effects of injection stiffness and injection volume on diastolic ventricular wall stress and thickness. To achieve this, finite element models were constructed with different hydrogel injection volumes (150µL and 300 µL), where the modulus was assessed over a range of 0.1kPa to 100kPa (based on experimental measurements). The results indicate that a larger injection volume and higher stiffness reduce diastolic myofiber stress the most, by maintaining the wall thickness during loading. Interestingly, the efficacy begins to taper after the hydrogel injection stiffness reaches a value of 50kPa. This computational approach could be used in the future to evaluate the optimal properties of the hydrogel.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Cutting is an important skill in team-sports, but unfortunately is also related to non-contact ACL injuries. The purpose was to examine knee kinetics and kinematics at different cutting angles.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
13 males and 16 females performed cuts at different angles (45°, 90°, 135° and 180°) at maximum speed. 3D kinematics and kinetics were collected. To determine differences across cutting angles (45°, 90°, 135° and 180°) and sex (female, male), a 4×2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted followed by post hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) with alpha level set at α≤0.05a priori.


RESULTS
At all cutting angles, males showed greater knee flexion angles than females (p<0.01). Also, where males performed all cutting angles with no differences in the amount of knee flexion -42.53°±8.95°, females decreased their knee flexion angle from -40.6°±7.2° when cutting at 45° to -36.81°±9.10° when cutting at 90°, 135° and 180° (p<0.01). Knee flexion moment decreased for both sexes when cutting towards sharper angles (p<0.05). At 90°, 135° and 180°, males showed greater knee valgus moments than females. For both sexes, knee valgus moment increased towards the sharper cutting angles and then stabilized compared to the 45° cutting angle (p<0.01). Both females and males showed smaller vGRF when cutting to sharper angles (p<0.01).


CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that different cutting angles demand different knee kinematics and kinetics. Sharper cutting angles place the knee more at risk. However, females and males handle this differently, which has implications for injury prevention.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although reducing stem stiffness can ameliorate the bone resorption, it increases stress at the bone-implant interface and can inhibit fixation. To overcome this complication, a novel cementless stem with a gradient in Young's modulus was developed using Ti-33.6Nb-4Sn (TNS) alloy. Local heat treatment applied at the neck region for increasing its strength resulted in a gradual decrease in Young's modulus from the proximal to the distal end, from 82.1 to 51.0GPa as calculated by a heat transfer simulation. The Young's modulus gradient did not induce the excessive interface stress which may cause the surface debonding. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate bone remodeling with the TNS stem using a strain-adaptive bone remodeling simulation based on finite element analysis. Our predictions showed that, for the TNS stem, bone reduction in the calcar region (Gruen zone 7) would be 13.6% at 2years, 29.0% at 5years, and 45.8% at 10years postoperatively. At 10 years, the bone mineral density for the TNS stem would be 42.6% higher than that for the similar Ti-6Al-4V alloy stem. The stress-strength ratio would be lower for the TNS stem than for the Ti-6Al-4V stem. These results suggest that although proximal bone loss cannot be eliminated completely, the TNS stem with a Young's modulus gradient may have bone-preserving effects and sufficient stem strength, without the excessive interface stress.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, most forearm muscles have fascicles that are longer than the field-of-view of traditional ultrasound (T-US). As such, little work has been done to quantify in vivo forearm muscle architecture. The extended field-of-view ultrasound (EFOV-US) method, which fits together a sequence of B-mode images taken from a continuous ultrasound scan, facilitates direct measurements of longer, curved fascicles. Here, we test the validity and reliability of the EFOV-US method for obtaining fascicle lengths in the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU). Fascicle lengths from images of the ECU captured in vivo with EFOV-US were compared to lengths from a well-established method, T-US. Images were collected in a joint posture that shortens the ECU such that entire fascicle lengths were captured within a single T-US image. Resulting measurements were not significantly different (p=0.18); a Bland-Altman test demonstrated their agreement. A novice sonographer implemented EFOV-US in a phantom and in vivo on the ECU. The novice sonographer's measurements from the ultrasound phantom indicate that the combined imaging and analysis method is valid (average error=2.2±1.3mm) and the in vivo fascicle length measurements demonstrate excellent reliability (ICC=0.97). To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify in vivo fascicle lengths of the ECU using any method. The ability to define a muscle's architecture in vivo using EFOV-US could lead to improvements in diagnosis, model development, surgery guidance, and rehabilitation techniques.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Instrumented gait analysis has been increasingly integrated into the clinical practice to enhance precision and inter-rater reliability for the assessment of pathological gait. On the other hand, the analysis of muscle synergies has gained relevance as a novel tool to describe the neural control of walking. Since muscle synergies and gait analysis capture different but equally important aspects of walking, we hypothesized that their combination can improve the current clinical tools for the assessment of walking performance. To test this hypothesis, we performed a complete bilateral, lower limb biomechanical and muscle synergies analysis on nine poststroke hemiparetic patients during overground walking. Using stepwise multiple regression, we identified a number of kinematic, kinetic, spatiotemporal and synergy-related features from the paretic and non-paretic side that, combined together, allow to predict impaired walking function better than the Fugl-Meyer Assessment score. These variables were time of peak knee flexion, VAFtotal values, duration of stance phase, peak of paretic propulsion and range of hip flexion. Since these five variables describe important biomechanical and neural control features underlying walking deficits poststroke, they may be feasible to drive customized rehabilitation therapies aimed to improve walking function. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of combining biomechanical and neural-related measures to assess locomotion performance in neurologically injured individuals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We compared the electromyographic (EMG) activity of USUB and LSUB during a variety of shoulder movements, with and without an external translation force. Intramuscular electrodes were inserted in USUB and LSUB segments of 20 adults without pathology and EMG activity was measured in stabilization trials (with and without an anterior or posterior directed force at the humerus and isometric rotations) and two shoulder positions (shoulder neutral, abduction). Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) trials were performed in abduction, internal and external rotation of the shoulder. In MVIC trials, USUB showed higher activity during internal rotation (p=0.03), whereas LSUB showed higher activity during external rotation (p<0.01). In stabilization trials, the interaction effects were significant for muscle segment×condition (p<0.01), and approached significance for muscle segment×position (p=0.06). In the neutral position, the pattern of activity for LSUB was similar to USUB. In the abducted position the LSUB, unlike USUB, was more active during external rotation (p=0.06) and also showed increased activity in response to the posterior directed force at the humerus (p=0.04). Our results suggest that USUB primarily acts asan agonist for internal rotation. In contrast LSUB was particularly active in external rotation in the abducted position and demonstrated increased EMG activity in response to the posteriorly directed force at the humerus in that position, suggesting more of a role in glenohumeral stabilization.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The evaluation of its stability and factors affecting it is vital in performance evaluation/enhancement, injury prevention and treatment managements. Knee stability often manifests itself by pain, hypermobility and giving-way sensations and is usually assessed by the passive joint laxity tests. Mechanical stability of both the human knee joint and the lower extremity at early stance periods of gait (0% and 5%) were quantified here for the first time using a hybrid musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity. The roles of muscle coactivity, simulated by setting minimum muscle activation at 0-10% levels and ACL deficiency, simulated by reducing ACL resistance by up to 85%, on the stability margin as well as joint biomechanics (contact/muscle/ligament forces) were investigated. Dynamic stability was analyzed using both linear buckling and perturbation approaches at the final deformed configurations in gait. The knee joint was much more stable at 0% stance than at 5% due to smaller ground reaction and contact forces. Muscle coactivity, when at lower intensities (<3% of its maximum active force), increased dynamic stability margin. Greater minimum activation levels, however, acted asan ineffective strategy to enhance stability. Coactivation also substantially increased muscle forces, joint loads and ACL force and hence the risk of further injury and degeneration. A deficiency in ACL decreases total ACL force (by 31% at 85% reduced stiffness) and the stability margin of the knee joint at the heel strike. It also markedly diminishes forces in lateral hamstrings (by up to 39%) and contact forces on the lateral plateau (by up to 17%). Current work emphasizes the need for quantification of the lower extremity stability margin in gait.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The respiratory epithelium is lined with a thin layer of airway surface liquid preventing interactions between the airflow and epithelium. The effect of the liquid lining in OSAS pathogenesis remains poorly understood despite clinical research. Previous studies have shown that the physical properties of the airway surface liquid or altered stimulation of the airway mechanoreceptors could alleviate or intensify OSAS; however, these studies do not provide a clear physical interpretation. To study the forces transmitted from the airflow to the liquid-lined compliant wall and to discuss the effects of the airway surface liquid properties on the stimulation of the mechanoreceptors, a novel and simplified experimental system mimicking the upper airway fundamental characteristics (i.e., liquid-lined compliant wall and complex unsteady airflow features) was constructed. The fluctuating force on the compliant wall was reduced through a damping mechanism when the liquid film thickness and/or the viscosity were increased. Conversely, the liquid film damping was reduced when the surface tension decreased. Based on the experimental data, empirical correlations were developed to predict the damping potential of the liquid film. In the future, this will enable us to extend the existing computational fluid-structure interaction simulations of airflow in the human upper airway by incorporating the airway surface liquid effect without adopting two-phase flow interface tracking methods. Furthermore, the experimental system developed in this study could be used to investigate the fundamental principles of the complex once/twice-coupled physical phenomena.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One such challenge is robustly quantifying joint coordination in a way that is intuitive and supports clinical decision-making. This work defines a new measure of coordination called the relative coordination metric (RCM) and its accompanying normalization schemes. RCM enables quantification of coordination during non-constrained discrete motions. Here RCM is applied to a grasping task. Fifteen healthy participants performed a reach, grasp, transport, and release task with a cup and a pen. The measured joint angles were then time-normalized and the RCM time-series were calculated between the shoulder-elbow, shoulder-wrist, and elbow-wrist. RCM was normalized using four differing criteria: the selected joint degree of freedom, angular velocity, angular magnitude, and range of motion. Percent time spent in specified RCM ranges was used asa composite metric and was evaluated for each trial. RCM was found to vary based on: (1) chosen normalization scheme, (2) the stage within the task, (3) the object grasped, and (4) the trajectory of the motion. The RCM addresses some of the limitations of current measures of coordination because it is applicable to discrete motions, does not rely on cyclic repetition, and uses velocity-based measures. Future work will explore clinically relevant differences in the RCM as it is expanded to evaluate different tasks and patient populations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We read with great interest the article written by Resende and colleagues (Resende et al., 2017) entitled, ‘How symmetric are metal-on-metal hip resurfacing patients during gait? Insights for the rehabilitation’ Hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) is a contentious subject given the high profile withdrawal of the DePuy Orthopaedic ASR metal-on-metal (MoM) implant (DePuy-ASR) due to high failure rates (de Steiger et al., 2011; Prosser et al., 2010). In their welldesigned kinematic study (Resende et al., 2017), the authors assessed whether a unilateral DePuy ASR HRA can result in symmetric gait. We applaud such a study, which aims to take assessment beyond functional scores, which have many well-documented limitations (Fitzpatrick et al., 1998). Despite analysing a withdrawn implant, the study demonstrates that all 12 ASR HRA patients having reported no pain. This is particularly reassuring as the mean time from surgery to gait assessment was 45 months, which puts this group of patients at the highest risk as most revisions occur in the early mid-term (Curtin et al., 2017; Laaksonen et al., 2017). Sadly, though, there was no mention of serum metal ions. It is well reported that raised serum metal ions are correlated to adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) (Laaksonen et al., 2017; Reito et al., 2013), which would negatively alter hip biomechanics. The prevalence of ALTRs in asymptomatic patients is also high (Chang et al., 2012; WynnJones et al., 2011). Moreover, the research looked at lower limb kinematic function and there is no evidence that these patients had any further imaging (ultrasound or MARS MRI) to ensure that there was not any surrounding soft tissue destruction. These omissions, which are now standard recommendations (MHRA, 2017), make it difficult to conclude as to whether these were well functioning or failing hips. Furthermore the authors present what appears to be a retrospective study as no preoperative data was presented. It is important to have baseline data in order to appreciate the effect of the intervention, which could be significantly worse or better. A single snapshot study, particularly with small numbers, could easily draw incorrect conclusions. Given this, the title of this paper would be better changed to ‘How symmetric are ASR hip resurfacing patients during gait’.

Biomechanical models can help test such hypothesis and shed light on the mechanism involved. A novel subject-specific musculoskeletal-modelling approach is introduced to estimate spinal loads during static activities in five healthy obese (BMI>30kg/m2) and five normal-weight (20<BMI<25kg/m2) individuals. Subjects underwent T1 through S1 MR imaging thereby measuring cross-sectional-area (CSA) and moment arms of trunk muscles together with mass and center of mass (CoM) of T1-L5 segments. MR-based subject-specific models estimated spinal loads using a kinematics/optimization-driven approach. Average CSAs of muscles, moment arms of abdominal muscles, mass and sagittal moment arm of CoM of T1-L5 segments were larger in obese individuals (p<0.05 except for the moment arm of CoMs) but moment arms of their back muscles were similar to those of normal-weight individuals (p>0.05). Heavier subjects did not necessarily have larger muscle moment arms (e.g., they were larger in 64kg (BMI=20.7kg/m2) subject than 78kg (BMI=24.6kg/m2) subject) or greater T1-L5 trunk weight (e.g., the 97kg (BMI=31kg/m2) subject had similar trunk weight as 109kg (BMI=33.3kg/m2) subject). Obese individuals had in average greater spinal loads than normal-weight ones but heavier subjects did not necessarily have greater spinal loads (117kg (BMI=40.0kg/m2) subject had rather similar L5-S1 compression as 105kg (BMI=34.7kg/m2) subject). Predicted L4-L5 intradiscal pressures for the normal-weight subjects ranged close to the measured values (R2=0.85-0.92).

The risk is increased in elderly persons with bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. However, half of the patients with fracture were not considered at risk based on bone density measurement (current clinical technique). We assume that loading conditions are of high importance and should be considered. Real loading conditions in a fall can reach a loading speed of 2m/s on average. The current study aimed to apply more realistic loading conditions that simulate a forward fall on the radius ex vivo. Thirty radii from elderly donors (79y.o.±12y.o., 15 males, 15 females) were loaded at 2m/s using a servo-hydraulic testing machine to mimic impact that corresponds to a fall. Among the 30 radii, 14 had a fracture after the impact, leading to two groups (fractured and non-fractured). Surfacic strain fields were measured using stereovision and allow for visualization of fracture patterns. The average maximum load was 2963±1274N. These experimental data will be useful for assessing the predictive capability of fracture risk prediction methods such as finite element models.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present research aimed to describe an inertial unit (IU)-based sprint mechanics evaluation model for assessing players' readiness to return to competition after suffering a grade I hamstring injury.


METHODS
A professional male football player (age 19years; height 177cm; weight 70kg, midfielder, Spanish, 3° Division) with a grade 1 biceps femoris injury was evaluated at pre-season, at return to play after injury and at the end of the competitive season. Sprint mechanics were analyzed via the use of an inertial orientation tracker (Xsens Technologies B.V. Enschede, Netherlands) attached over the L3-L4 region of the subject's lumbar spine. Sprint mechanics such as horizontal components of ground reaction force were assessed in both legs during sprinting actions. Findings and interpretation: Both the coefficient of the horizontal force application (SFV) and the ratio of forces (DRF) applied at increasing velocity were decreased in the injured limb compared with the contralateral healthy limb at the return to play evaluation (73% and 76% reductions, respectively) and returned to symmetrical levels at the end-season evaluation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Elbow SRS is compared between obstetric brachial plexus lesion (OBPL) patients and healthy subjects (cross-sectional study design). Seven controls (median 28years) and five patients (median 31years) isometrically flexed and extended the elbow at rest and three additional torques [2.1,4.3,6.4Nm] while a fast stretch stimulus was applied. SRS was estimated in silico using a neuromechanical elbow model simulating the torque response from the imposed elbow angle. SRS was higher in patients (250±36Nm/rad) than in controls (150±21Nm/rad, p=0.014), except for the rest condition. Higher elbow SRS suggested greater cocontraction in patients compared to controls. SRS is a promising mechanical alternative to assess cocontraction, which is a frequently encountered clinical problem in OBPL due to axonal misrouting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The PC is of importance due to its integral role in somatosensation and the critical need to understand PC function for haptic feedback system development. Previous theoretical and computational studies have modeled the physiological response of the PC to sustained or vibrating mechanical stimuli, but they have used estimates of the receptor's mechanical properties, which remain largely unmeasured. In this study, we used micropipette aspiration (MPA) to determine an apparent Young's modulus for PCs isolated from a cadaveric human hand. MPA was applied in increments of 5mm H2O (49Pa), and the change in protrusion length of the PC into the pipette was recorded. The protrusion length vs. suction pressure data were used to calculate the apparent Young's modulus. Using 10 PCs with long-axis lengths of 2.99±0.41mm and short-axis lengths of 1.45±0.22mm, we calculated a Young's modulus of 1.40±0.86kPa. Our measurement is on the same order of magnitude as those approximated in previous models, which estimated the PC to be on the same order of magnitude as skin or isolated cells, so we recommend that a modulus in the kPa range be used in future studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study aimed to verify how simultaneous changes on knee/hip positions modify the ankle's resting position and passive torque. Thirty-seven subjects underwent an isokinetic assessment of ankle passive torque. The relationship between the absolute values of ankle passive resistance torque and the ankle angular position was used to calculate the dependent variables: ankle resting position (position in which the passive resistance torque is zero); and ankle passive torque at 0° (torque at the neutral position of the ankle in the sagittal plane). These measures were carried out under three test conditions: 0° at knee and 0° at hip (0°/0°); 90° at knee and 90° at hip (90°/90°); and, 135° at knee and 120° at hip (135°/120°). The results demonstrated that the ankle resting position shifted towards dorsiflexion when knee/hip position changed from 0°/0° to 90°/90° and shifted towards plantar flexion when knee/hip position changed from 90°/90° to 135°/120°, achieving values close to the ones at the position 0°/0°. Similarly, passive torque reduced when knee/hip position changed from 0°/0° to 90°/90°, but it increased when knee/hip position changed from 90°/90° to 135°/120°. The unexpected changes observed in ankle passive torque and resting position due to changes in knee and hip from 90°/90° to 135°/120°, cannot be explained exclusively by forces related to tissues crossing the knee and ankle. This result supports the existence of myofascial force transmission among lower limb joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the effects of shape variation on flow characteristics remain unclear. The flow characteristics are known to affect vulnerable stenosis rupture and fractional flow reserve (FFR) value which has been widely used as a diagnostic tool for stenosis. Vulnerable stenosis rupture occurs when the structural stress exerted on a fibrous cap exceeds its tolerable threshold. The stress magnitude is determined from the spatial distribution of static pressure around the stenosis. In the present study, the static pressure distribution and the FFR value in deformable stenosis were investigated with related other flow characteristics. Two phantom models were fabricated to mimic deformable and nondeformable stenoses using polydimethylsiloxane. The flow characteristics were observed under a steady-flow condition at three Reynolds numbers (Re=500, 1000, 1500) using a particle image velocimetry. The pressure drop across the stenosis models were measured using a pressure sensor to determine effects of shape deformation on FFR value. Shape variations and jet deflections were clearly observed in the deformable stenosis model, and the effective severity of the stenosis increased up to 17.2%. The shape variations of deformable stenosis model increased the static pressure difference at the upstream and downstream sides of the stenosis. The pressure drop across the deformable stenosis model was significantly higher than that of the nondeformable stenosis model. The present results substantiate that stenosis deformability should be carefully considered to diagnose the rupture of vulnerable stenosis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, changes in dynamic knee joint contact stresses after ACL rupture have not been quantified for activities of daily living. Our objective was to characterize changes in dynamic contact stress profiles that occur across the tibial plateau immediately after ACL transection. By subjecting sensor-augmented cadaveric knees to simulated gait, and analyzing the resulting contact stress profiles using a normalized cross-correlation algorithm, we tested the hypothesis that common changes in dynamic contact stress profiles exist after ACL injury. Three common profiles were identified in intact knees, occurring on the: (I) posterior lateral plateau, (II) posterior medial plateau, and (III) central region of the medial plateau. In ACL-transected knees, the magnitude and shape of the common dynamic stress profiles did not change, but their locations on the tibial plateau and the number of knees identified for each profile changed. Furthermore, in the ACL transected knees, a unique common contact stress profile was identified in the posterior region of the lateral plateau near the tibial spine. This framework can be used to understand the regional and temporal changes in joint mechanics after injury.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We found that the rotational orbit was strongly dependent on the dynein activation frequency. We also investigated flow field generated by the ciliary rotation, and the flow strength decayed as r-3 at the far field from the cilium. Our numerical results also suggest that experimentally observed tilt angle θ=2π/9 is sufficiently large to make a leftward flow.

The goal of this study was to develop a novel method to determine detrusor wall biomechanical parameters during urodynamics through the incorporation of transabdominal ultrasound imaging. Individuals with overactive bladder (OAB) underwent ultrasound imaging during filling. The fill rate was 10% of the cystometric capacity per minute as determined by an initial fill. Transabdominal ultrasound images were captured in the midsagittal and transverse planes at 1min intervals. Using image data and Pves, detrusor wall tension, stress, and compliance were calculated. From each cross-sectional image, luminal and wall areas along with inner perimeters were measured. In the sagittal and transverse planes, wall tension was calculated as Pves∗luminal area, wall stress as tension/wall area, and strain as the change in perimeter normalized to the perimeter at 10% capacity. Elastic modulus was calculated as stress/strain in the medial-lateral and cranial-caudal directions. Patient-reported fullness sensation was continuously recorded. Data from five individuals with OAB showed that detrusor wall tension, volume, and strain had the highest correlations to continuous bladder sensation of all quantities measured. This study demonstrates how detrusor wall tension, stress, strain, and elastic modulus can be quantified by adding ultrasound imaging to standard urodynamics. This technique may be useful in diagnosing and better understanding the biomechanics involved in OAB and other bladder disorders.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Such a treatment is the first step in developing comprehensive multiscale and multiphysics models. We highlight two important aspects of aortic valve tissue behavior: the role of the collagen fiber microstructure and the native prestressing. We propose a model that captures these two features as well as the heterogeneous layer-scale topology of the tissue. We find the model can reproduce the experimentally observed multiscale mechanical behavior in a manner that provides intuition on the underlying mechanics.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Force plate measurements of F and estimates from the proposed IMU method were collected while subjects (n=15) performed a standing sprint start (SS) and a 45° change of direction task (COD). Error in the IMU estimate of step-averaged component and resultant F was quantified by comparison to estimates from the force plate using Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (LOA), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r), and the effect size (ES) of the differences between the two systems. RMSE of the IMU estimate of step-average F ranged from 37.70 N to 77.05 N with ES between 0.04 and 0.47 for SS while for COD, RMSE was between 54.19 N to 182.92 N with ES between 0.08 and 1.69. Correlation coefficients between the IMU and force plate measurements were significant (p≤0.05) for all values (r=0.53 to 0.95) except the medio-lateral component of step-average F. The average angular error in the IMU estimate of the orientation of step-average F was ≤10° for all tasks.

The most widely used measurement approach is the acromion marker cluster (AMC), which can yield large errors in extreme humeral elevation and can be inaccurate in children and patient populations. Recently, an individualized regression approach has been proposed as an alternative to the AMC. This technique utilizes the relationship between ST orientation, humerothoracic orientation and acromion process position derived from calibration positions to predict dynamic ST orientations from humerothoracic and acromion process measures during motion. These individualized regressions demonstrated promising results for healthy adults; however, this method had not yet been compared to the more conventional AMC. This study compared ST orientation estimates by the AMC and regression approaches to static ST angles determined by surface markers placed on palpated landmarks in typically developing adolescents performing functional tasks. Both approaches produced errors within the range reported in the literature for skin-based scapular measurement techniques. The performance of the regression approach suffered when applied to positions outside of the range of motion in the set of calibration positions. The AMC significantly underestimated ST internal rotation across all positions and overestimated posterior tilt in some positions. Overall, root mean square errors for the regression approach were smaller than the AMC for every position across all axes of ST motion. Accordingly, we recommend the regression approach as a suitable technique for measuring ST kinematics in functional motion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A finite element evaluation.,"The generation of particulate debris at the taper junction of total hip replacements (THRs), can cause failure of the artificial hip. The taper surfaces of femoral heads and trunnions of femoral stems are generally machined to a certain roughness to enhance fixation. However, the effect of the surface roughness of these surfaces on the fixation, wear and consequently clinical outcomes of the design is largely unknown. In this study, we asked whether a micro-grooved trunnion surface finish (1) improves the fixation and (2) reduces the wear rate at the taper junction of THRs. We used 3D finite element (FE) models of THRs to, firstly, investigate the effect of initial fixation of a Cobalt-Chromium femoral head with a smooth taper surface mated with a Titanium (1) micro-grooved and (2) smooth, trunnion surface finishes. Secondly, we used a computational FE wear model to compare the wear evolution between the models, which was then validated against wear measurements of the taper surface of explanted femoral heads. The fixation at the taper junction was found to be better for the smooth couplings. Over a 7 million load cycle analysis in-silico, the linear wear depth and the total material loss was around 3.2 and 1.4 times higher for the femoral heads mated with micro-grooved trunnions. It was therefore concluded that smooth taper and trunnion surfaces will provide better fixation at the taper junction and reduce the volumetric wear rates.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Differences in material properties between the fiber regions could influence which tissue is more optimal for surgical harvesting. The current study utilized ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) to investigate whether the in vivo material properties differ between the fiber regions. Shear wave velocities (SWVs) were collected from the sternocostal and clavicular fiber regions of the pectoralis major from ten healthy young male participants. Participants produced isometric shoulder torques of varying magnitudes (passive, 15%, and 30% MVC) and directions (horizontal and vertical adduction). Four shoulder positions encompassing different vertical abduction and external rotation angles were examined. One-way ANOVAs tested the hypotheses that differences in SWVs during rest existed between the fiber regions asa function of shoulder position, and differences in SWVs during contraction existed asa function of shoulder position and torque direction. In all shoulder positions, the clavicular region exhibited greater SWVs during rest than the sternocostal region (P<0.001). In shoulder positions that did not include external rotation, the clavicular region exhibited greater SWVs during contraction when producing horizontal adduction torques (P<0.001), while the sternocostal region exhibited greater SWVs during contraction when producing vertical adduction torques at 30% MVC (P<0.01).

There are many sensitivities in measuring this effect. A comparison between numerical simulations, experiments and theory is urgently required to observe whether the effect is significant. In this study, the beneficial effect of a small finger spread in swimming is confirmed using three different but complementary methods. For the first time numerical simulations and laboratory experiments are conducted on the exact same 3D model of the hand with attached forearm. The virtual version of the hand with forearm was implemented in a numerical code by means of an immersed boundary method and the 3D printed physical version was studied in a wind tunnel experiment. An enhancement of the drag coefficient of 2% and 5% compared to the case with closed fingers was found for the numerical simulation and experiment, respectively. A 5% and 8% favorable effect on the (dimensionless) force moment at an optimal finger spreading of 10° was found, which indicates that the difference is more outspoken in the force moment. Moreover, an analytical model is proposed, using scaling arguments similar to the Betz actuator disk model, to explain the drag coefficient as a function of finger spacing.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although it is well known that fall is a common complication after stroke, no study considered the role of both trunk and head when assessing gait stability in this population. The primary aim of this study was to propose a multi-sensor protocol to quantify gait stability in patients with subacute stroke using gait quality indices derived from pelvis, sternum, and head accelerations. Second, the association of these indices with the level of walking ability, with traditional clinical scale scores, and with fall events occurring within the six months after patients' dismissal was investigated. The accelerations corresponding to the three abovementioned body levels were measured using inertial sensors during a 10-Meter Walk Test performed by 45 inpatients and 25 control healthy subjects. A set of indices related to gait stability were estimated and clinical performance scales were administered to each patient. The amplitude of the accelerations, the way it is attenuated/amplified from lower to upper body levels, and the gait symmetry provide valuable information about subject-specific motor strategies, discriminate between different levels of walking ability, and correlate with clinical scales. In conclusion, the proposed multi-sensor protocol could represent a useful tool to quantify gait stability, support clinicians in the identification of patients potentially exposed to a high risk of falling, and assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation protocols in the clinical routine.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The SLM consists of polyurethane foam used to mimic the spongy lung tissue and fluid-filled gelatine microcapsules used to simulate the damage of alveoli. The bursting pressure of the microcapsules was investigated by conducting low and high rate compression tests on single microcapsules. A bursting pressure of around 5bar was measured which is comparable to the reported lung overpressure at injury level. Low and high rate compression tests were conducted on the SLMs. From the measured mechanical properties and mass density, the stress wave speed was calculated and found to be well in the range of the reported values for human lungs (16-70m/s). In order to study the extent and distribution of damage in the SLMs, as represented by burst microcapsules, a CT scan analysis was carried out before and after the impacts. The CT scan results clearly demonstrated the magnitude and distribution of damage within the specimen. The results are then compared to the Bowen curves, the most often used criteria for predicting blast injuries in humans. An excellent agreement was found between the observed damage in the surrogate lungs and the expected damage in real human lungs. In general, the SLM showed similar stress wave speed, bursting pressure and damage to that of the real lungs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Considering the closed anatomical relationship between the scapula and the thoracic cage, the presence of postural disturbances could be linked to alterations in the scapular position and orientation in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, currently there is a lack of descriptive research and detailed assessment of scapular kinematics in AIS. The aim of this study was to investigate the three-dimensional scapular kinematics in AIS. Nineteen AIS patients and fourteen healthy controls participated in this study. Bilateral shoulder kinematics were measured with an electromagnetic tracking device during shoulder elevation in the sagittal, scapular, and frontal planes. Data for the scapular orientation were analyzed in the resting position and at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of humerothoracic elevation. Scapular behavior was different in participants with AIS, compared to healthy controls, with different patterns observed on convex and concave sides. While examining all three planes of elevation, the scapula was more internally and anteriorly tilted on the convex side, while the scapula was more externally, downwardly rotated, and posteriorly tilted on the concave side in participants with AIS. Furthermore, there was a decreased peak humerothoracic elevation and altered scapular posterior tilt in participants with AIS in the resting position.

Subjects were instructed to either 'maximally resist the perturbation' or to 'relax but remain upright' with eyes closed. Frequency response functions (FRFs) of admittance, the amount of movement per unit of force applied, and reflexes, the modulation of trunk extensor activity per unit of trunk displacement, were obtained. To these FRFs, we fitted physiological models, to estimate intrinsic trunk stiffness and damping, as well as feedback gains and delays. The different model versions were compared to assess which feedback loops contribute to trunk stabilization. Intrinsic stiffness and damping and muscle spindle (short-delay) feedback alone were sufficient to accurately describe trunk stabilization, but only with unrealistically low reflex delays. Addition of muscle spindle acceleration feedback or inhibitory Golgi tendon organ feedback yielded realistic delays and improved the model fit, with a significantly better model fit with acceleration feedback. Addition of vestibular feedback did not improve the model fit. In conclusion, muscle spindle feedback and intrinsic mechanical properties are sufficient to describe trunk stabilization in the sagittal plane under small mechanical perturbations, provided that muscle spindles encode acceleration in addition to velocity and position information.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, by varying the cadence and cyclist bodyweight, we tested whether the transition is better explained by the greater power economy of a standing position or by the emergence of mechanical constraints that force cyclists to stand. Ten males participated in five experimental sessions corresponding to different bodyweights (80%, 100%, or 120%) and cadences (50RPM, 70RPM, or 90RPM). In each session, we first determined the seat-to-stand transition power (SSTP) in an incremental test. The participants then cycled at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, or 120% of the SSTP in the seated and standing positions, for which we recorded the saddle forces and electromyogram (EMG) signals of eight lower limb muscles. We estimated the cycling cost using an EMG cost function (ECF) and the minimal saddle forces in the seated position as an indicator of the mechanical constraints. Our results show the SSTP to vary with respect to both cadence and bodyweight. The ECF was lower in the standing position above the SSTP value (i.e., at 120%) in all experimental sessions. The minimal saddle forces varied significantly with respect to both cadence and bodyweight. These results suggest that optimization of the muscular cost function, rather than mechanical constraints, explain the seat-to-stand transition in cycling.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, both research and clinical studies have shown conflicting results and it is unclear whether these design variations do improve loosening rates. Part of the difficulty in investigating fixation failure is the inability to directly observe the fixation interface, a problem addressed in this study by using a novel experimental set-up. Cyclic loading-displacement tests were carried out on 60 custom-made glenoid prostheses implanted into a bone substitute. Design parameters investigated included treatment of the fixation surface of the component resulting in different levels of back-surface roughness, flat-back versus curved-back, keel versus peg and more versus less conforming implants. Visually-observed failure and ASTM-recommended rim-displacements were recorded throughout testing to investigate fixation failure and if rim displacement is an appropriate measure of loosening. Roughening the implant back (Ra>3µm) improved resistance to failure (P<0.005) by an order of magnitude with the rough and smooth groups failing at 8712±5584 cycles (mean±SD) and 1080±1197 cycles, respectively. All other design parameters had no statistically significant effect on the number of cycles to failure. All implants failed inferiorly and 95% (57/60) at the implant/cement interface. Rim-displacement correlated with visually observed failure. The most important effect was that of roughening the implant, which strengthened the polyethylene-cement interface. Rim-displacement can be used as an indicator of fixation failure, but the sensitivity was insufficient to capture subtle effects.

In this study, the influence of the depth-wise variation of FCD was investigated on the internal collagen fibril strains and the mechanical response of the knee joint cartilage during gait using finite element (FE) analysis. The FCD distribution of tibial cartilage was implemented from sodium (23Na) MRI into a 3-D FE-model of the knee joint (""Healthy model""). For comparison, models with decreased FCD values were created according to the decrease in FCD associated with the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) (""Early OA"" and ""Advanced OA"" models). In addition, a model without FCD was created (""No FCD"" model). The effect of FCD was studied with five different collagen fibril network moduli of cartilage. Using the reference fibril network moduli, the decrease in FCD from ""Healthy model"" to ""Early OA"" and ""Advanced OA"" models resulted in increased axial strains (by +2 and +6%) and decreased fibril strains (by -3 and -13%) throughout the stance, respectively, calculated as mean values through cartilage depth in the tibiofemoral contact regions. Correspondingly, compared to the ""Healthy model"", the removal of the FCD altogether in ""NoFCD model"" resulted in increased mean axial strains by +16% and decreased mean fibril strains by -24%. This effect was amplified as the fibril network moduli were decreased by 80% from the reference. Then mean axial strains increased by +6, +19 and +49% and mean fibril strains decreased by -9, -20 and -32%, respectively. Our results suggest that the FCD in articular cartilage has influence on cartilage responses in the knee during walking. Furthermore, the FCD is suggested to have larger impact on cartilage function as the collagen network degenerates e.g. in OA.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the current study, experimental measurements of micromotions were compared with predicted micromotions by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using two bone material models: linear elastic and post-yield material behavior, while an actual range of interference fit was simulated. The primary aim was to investigate whether a plasticity model is essential in order to calculate realistic micromotions. Additionally, experimental bone damage at the interface was compared with the FEA simulated range. TKR surgical cuts were applied to five cadaveric femora and micro- and clinical CT- scans of these un-implanted specimens were made to extract geometrical and material properties, respectively. Micromotions at the interface were measured using digital image correlation. Cadaver-specific FEA models were created based on the experimental set-up. The average experimental micromotion of all specimens was 53.1±42.3µm (mean±standard deviation (SD)), which was significantly higher than the micromotions predicted by both models, using either the plastic or elastic material model (26.5±23.9µm and 10.1±10.1µm, respectively; p-value<0.001 for both material models). The difference between the two material models was also significant (p-value<0.001). The predicted damage had a magnitude and distribution which was comparable to the experimental bone damage. We conclude that, although the plastic model could not fully predict the micro motions, it is more suitable for pre-clinical assessment of a press-fit TKR implant than using an elastic bone model.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Research investigating severe brain injury has reported that strains in the brain may be affected by two parameters: magnitude of the acceleration, and duration of that acceleration. However, little is known how this relationship changes in terms of creating risk for brain injury for magnitudes and durations of acceleration common in sporting environments. This has particular implications for the understanding and prevention of concussive risk of injury in sporting environments. The purpose of this research was to examine the interaction between linear and rotational acceleration and duration on maximum principal strain in the brain tissues for loading conditions incurred in sporting environments. Linear and rotational acceleration loading curves of magnitudes and durations similar to those from impact in sport were used as input to the University College Brain Trauma Model and maximum principal strain (MPS) was measured for the different curves. The results demonstrated that magnitude and duration do have an effect on the strain incurred by the brain tissue. As the duration of the acceleration increases, the magnitude required to achieve strains reflecting a high risk of concussion decreases, with rotational acceleration becoming the dominant contributor. The magnitude required to attain a magnitude of MPS representing risk of brain injury was found to be as low as 2500rad/s2 for impacts of 10-15ms; indicating that interventions to reduce the risk of concussion in sport must consider the duration of the event while reducing the magnitude of acceleration the head incurs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The noninvasive quantification of collateral ligament strain could provide an important clinical metric of knee frontal plane stability, which is relevant in ligament injury and for measuring outcomes following total knee arthroplasty. In this pilot cadaveric experiment, we investigated the possibility of measuring collateral ligament strain with our previously validated speckle-tracking approach, but encountered a number of challenges during both data acquisition and processing. Given the clinical interest in this type of tool, and the fact that this is a developing area of research, the goal of this article is to transparently describe this pilot study, both in terms of methods and results, while also identifying specific challenges to this work and areas for future study. Some challenges faced relate generally to speckle-tracking of soft tissues (e.g. the limitations of using a 2D imaging modality to characterize 3D motion), while others are specific to this application (e.g. the small size and complex anatomy of the collateral ligaments). This work illustrates a clear need for additional studies, particularly relating to the collection of ground-truth data and more thorough validation work.

We investigated the fidelity of these simplified models (i.e., spherical joints with/without rotational springs and beams considering nonlinear/linear properties) in predicting kinematics of the ligamentous spine in comparison with a detailed finite element (FE) model while considering various anterior-posterior joint placements. Using the simplified models with different joint offsets in a subject-specific musculoskeletal model, we computed local spinal forces during forward flexion and compared results with intradiscal pressure measurements. In comparison to the detailed FE model, linearized beam and spherical joint models failed to reproduce kinematics whereas the nonlinear beam model with joint offsets at -2 to +4mm range (+: posterior) showed satisfactory performance. In the musculoskeletal models without a hand-load, removing rotational springs, linearizing passive properties and offsetting the joints posteriorly (by 4mm) increased compression (∼32%, 17% and 11%) and shear (∼63%, 26% and 15%) forces. Posterior shift in beam and spherical joints increased extensor muscle active forces but dropped their passive force components resulting in delayed flexion relaxation and lower antagonistic activity in abdominal muscles. Overall and in sagittally symmetric tasks, shear deformable beams with nonlinear properties performed best followed by the spherical joints with nonlinear rotational springs. Using linear rotational springs or beams is valid only in small flexion angles (<30°) and under small external loads. Joints should be placed at the mid-disc height within -2 to +4mm anterior-posterior range of the disc geometric center and passive properties (joint stiffnesses) should not be overlooked.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The current study aimed therefore at reproducing independent, recently published three-segment foot kinetic data (Study 1) and in a second stage expand the estimation towards a four-segment model (Study 2). Concerning the reproducibility study, two recently published three segment foot models (Bruening et al., 2014; Saraswat et al., 2014) were reproduced and kinetic parameters were incorporated in order to calculate joint moments and powers of paediatric cohorts during gait. Ground reaction forces were measured with an integrated force/pressure plate measurement set-up and a recently published proportionality scheme was applied to determine subarea total ground reaction forces. Regarding Study 2, moments and powers were estimated with respect to the Instituto Ortopedico Rizzoli four-segment model. The proportionality scheme was expanded in this study and the impact of joint centre location on kinetic data was evaluated. Findings related to Study 1 showed in general good agreement with the kinetic data published by Bruening et al. (2014). Contrarily, the peak ankle, midfoot and hallux powers published by Saraswat et al. (2014) are disputed. Findings of Study 2 revealed that the chopart joint encompasses both power absorption and generation, whereas the Lisfranc joint mainly contributes to power generation. The results highlights the necessity for further studies in the field of foot kinetic models and provides a first estimation of the kinetic behaviour of the Lisfranc joint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Data in the literature suggest that the TM cannot be considered mechanically as a uniform layer of isotropic elastic material, because the value of its Young's modulus depends on the methods of measurements and can vary up to five orders of magnitude. To this end, we proposed a new theoretical framework for mechanical analysis of the TM, in which the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and the juxtacanalicular tissue in the TM were treated as a uniform layer of isotropic elastic material, and the rest of the TM, i.e., the uveal and corneoscleral meshworks, were modeled as a uniform layer of transversely isotropic material. Using the model, we demonstrated that the large discrepancy in the apparent Young's modulus reported in the literature could be caused by the anisotropy of the meshwork that was significantly stiffer in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction. The theoretical framework could be used to integrate existing data of the stiffness, investigate anisotropic behaviors of the tissues, and develop new methods to measure mechanical properties of the TM.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ultrashort echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to directly detect signal from tissues with very short T2 values, including unique viscoelastic tissues such as tendons. The purpose of this study was to use UTE sequences to measure T2∗, T1 and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) variations of tendon samples under static tensile loads. Six human peroneal tendons were imaged before and under static loading using UTE sequences on a clinical 3T MRI scanner. Tendons were divided into two static tensile loading groups: group A that underwent one-step loading (15N) and group B that underwent two-step loading (15 and 30N). The T2∗, T1 and MTR variations were investigated in two selected section regions of interest (ROIs), including whole and core sections. Mean T2∗ values for the first step of loading (groups A and B) in both whole section and core section ROIs were significantly decreased by 13±7% (P=0.028) and 16±5% (P=0.017), respectively. For the second loading step (group B), there was a consistent, but non-significant reduction in T2∗ value by 9±2% (P=0.059) and 7±5% (P=0.121) for whole and core sections, respectively. Mean T1 did not show any consistent changes for either loading steps (P>0.05). Mean MTR increased slightly, but not significantly for both loading steps (P>0.05).

This paper presents the validation of a customized smart shoe for estimating foot progression angle during walking. The smart shoe is composed of an electronic module with inertial and magnetometer sensing inserted into the sole of a standard walking shoe. The smart shoe charges wirelessly, and up to 160h of continuous data (sampled at 100Hz) can be stored locally on the shoe. For validation testing, fourteen healthy subjects were recruited and performed treadmill walking trials with small, medium, and large toe-in (internal foot rotation), small, medium, and large toe-out (external foot rotation) and normal foot progression angle at self-selected walking speeds. Foot progression angle calculations from the smart shoe were compared with measurements from a standard motion capture system. In general, foot progression angle values from the smart shoe closely followed motion capture values for all walking conditions with an overall average error of 0.1±1.9deg and an overall average absolute error of 1.7±1.0deg. There were no significant differences in foot progression angle accuracy across the seven different walking gait patterns. The presented smart shoe could potentially be used for knee osteoarthritis or other clinical applications requiring foot progression angle assessment in community settings or in clinics without specialized motion capture equipment.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

With vertical vibration excitation, this study investigated how forces are distributed over the body-seat interface. Vertical and fore-and-aft forces were measured beneath the ischial tuberosities, middle thighs, and front thighs of 14 subjects sitting on a rigid flat seat in three postures with different thigh contact while exposed to random vertical vibration at three magnitudes. Measures of apparent mass were calculated from transfer functions between the vertical acceleration of the seat and the vertical or fore-and-aft forces measured at the three locations, and the sum of these forces. When sitting normally or sitting with a high footrest, vertical forces at the ischial tuberosities dominated the vertical apparent mass. With feet unsupported to give increased thigh contact, vertical forces at the front thighs were dominant around 8Hz. Around 3-7Hz, fore-and-aft forces at the middle thighs dominated the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass. Around 8-10Hz, fore-and-aft forces were dominant at the ischial tuberosities with feet supported but at the front thighs with feet unsupported. All apparent masses were nonlinear: as the vibration magnitude increased the resonance frequencies decreased. With feet unsupported, the nonlinearity in the apparent mass was greater at the front thighs than at the ischial tuberosities. It is concluded that when the thighs are supported on a seat it is not appropriate to assume the body has a single point of vibration excitation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Insufficient extensibility might lead to an incomplete reconstruction; moreover, excessive stresses after repair may result in repair failure without healing. Therefore, estimates of extensibility of cuff muscles can help in pre-surgical planning to prevent unexpected scenarios during surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine if quantified mechanical properties of the supraspinatus muscle using shear wave elastography (SWE) could be used to predict the extensibility of the musculotendinous unit on cadaveric specimens. Forty-five fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders (25 intact and 20 with rotator cuff tear) were used for the study. Passive stiffness of 4 anatomical regions in the supraspinatus muscle was first measured using SWE. After detaching the distal edge of supraspinatus muscle from other cuff muscles, the detached muscle was axially pulled with the scapula fixed. The correlation between the SWE modulus and the extensibility of the muscle under 30 and 60N loads was assessed. There was a significant negative correlation between SWE measurements and the experimental extensibility. SWE modulus for the anterior-deep region in the supraspinatus muscle showed the strongest correlation with extensibility under 30N (r=0.70, P<0.001) and 60N (r=0.68, P<0.001).

Meniscus degeneration affects ∼35% of the population, and potentially leads to knee osteoarthritis. The etiology of meniscal degeneration remains to be elucidated, although many factors have been considered. However, the role of nutritional supply to meniscus cells in the pathogenesis of meniscus degeneration has been so far overlooked. Nutrients are delivered to meniscal cells through the surrounding synovial fluid and the blood vessels present in the outer region of the meniscus. During maturation, vascularization progressively recedes up to the outer 10% of the tissue, leaving the majority avascular. It has been hypothesized that vascular recession might significantly reduce the nutrient supply to cells, thus contributing to meniscus degeneration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of vascular recession on nutrient levels available to meniscus cells. This was done by developing a novel computational model for meniscus homeostasis based on mixture theory. It was found that transvascular transport of nutrients in the vascularized region of the meniscus contributes to more than 40% of the glucose content in the core of the tissue. However, vascular recession does not significantly alter nutrient levels in the meniscus, reducing at most 5% of the nutrient content in the central portion of the tissue. Therefore, our analysis suggests that reduced vascularity is not likely a primary initiating source in tissue degeneration. However, it does feasibly play a key role in inability for self-repair, as seen clinically.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

All rights reserved. Thanks to Google Scholar, we were instantly alerted to the article from Dennis et al. (2017), entitled ‘‘Cerebral aneurysm blood flow simulations are sensitive to basic solver settings” which demonstrated the impact of time-step size and residual error tolerances on aneurysm CFD solutions. While we appreciate the attention that is being paid, finally, to robust verification of cardiovascular CFD models, we were surprised and disappointed that the authors appeared to be unaware of a study published in 2015, in which we looked at the compounding effects of mesh density, time-step size and solver numerics on aneurysm CFD (Khan et al., 2015). In particular, we demonstrated the clear benefits of using high-order numerical schemes allowing for coarser mesh and time-step resolutions vs. prevalent low-order, dissipative schemes with fine resolutions. While our study relied on open-source solvers, we did include in the Discussion a sanity check using Fluent. Specifically, for a single (steady inflow) model with fixed mesh density and time-step size, we gradually refined several Fluent solver settings from their default values, and showed that this had a non-negligible effect on the (suppression of) flow instabilities. Dennis et al. appeared to use expert choices for their fixed solver settings (e.g. solver order, pressure scheme, upwinding method). In our experience with aneurysm CFD Challenges, many groups are not using (and may not even be aware of) such expert options, but rather are relying on default solver settings, which often turn out to be low-order, dissipative schemes. We fear that Dennis et al.’s emphasis on residual error tolerances may draw attention away from those more basic and crucial solver settings. We also think the readership deserves more clarity from this Mayo Clinic group on the practical impact of what seem, at least from the single case shown in their Figs. 2–4, to be minor differences in peak systolic flow patterns due to the solver settings they chose to vary. Slight changes in the location or extent of an impingement jet or vortex core can lead to apparently large point-wise errors; however, one may question whether these are ‘‘large” relative to the uncertainties of aneurysm CFD and of clinical decision-making. For example, Dr. Kallmes has previously highlighted the problem of aneurysm neck overestimation by 3D angiography (Kallmes, 2011), which was subsequently shown to have a similar – or, depending upon one’s perspective, similarly minor – impact on intra-aneurysm flow and WSS (Schneiders et al., 2013). In this context, Dennis et al.’s paper might have the unintended and ironic effect of discouraging users from probing their basic solver settings if they perceive the reported differences to be, practically, negligible. Finally, Dennis et al. conclude that solution convergence ‘‘must be ensured individually and independently for each aneurysm simulation”, which echoes the conclusion of a previous grid refinement study from this group (Hodis et al., 2012). As we pointed out in Khan et al. (2015), such case-by-case verification is hardly pragmatic for large studies. (Or, to put it in clinical terms, it might well be efficacious, but it’s unlikely to be effective.) Instead, as argued in Khan et al. (2015), a more practicable approach would be to establish robust and rigorously calibrated CFD protocols, which aim to balance the trade-offs among CPU time, operator time, and the nominal accuracy required by the clinical or biological application. In summary, we regret that Dennis et al. missed this opportunity to reflect upon, and perhaps rebut, some of the issues raised in our 2015 study. In writing this letter, we hope to stimulate such dialog for the benefit of the aneurysm CFD community.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is also thought that elastin is responsible for the low energy loss observed with cyclic loading. These tenets are supported through experiments that alter component amounts through protease digestion, vessel remodeling, normal growth, or in different artery types. Genetic engineering provides the opportunity to revisit these tenets through the loss of expression of specific wall components. We used newborn mice lacking elastin (Eln-/-) or two key proteins (lysyl oxidase, Lox-/-, or fibulin-4, Fbln4-/-) that are necessary for the assembly of mechanically-functional elastic fibers to investigate the contributions of elastic fibers to large artery mechanics. We determined component content and organization and quantified the nonlinear and viscoelastic mechanical behavior of Eln-/-, Lox-/-, and Fbln4-/- ascending aorta and their respective controls. We confirmed that the lack of elastin, fibulin-4, or lysyl oxidase leads to absent or highly fragmented elastic fibers in the aortic wall and a 56-97% decrease in crosslinked elastin amounts. We found that the resistance to stretch at low pressure is decreased only in Eln-/- aorta, confirming the role of elastin in the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the aortic wall. Dissipated energy with cyclic loading and unloading is increased 53-387% in Eln-/-, Lox-/-, and Fbln4-/- aorta, indicating that not only elastin, but properly assembled and crosslinked elastic fibers, are necessary for low energy loss in the aorta.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate knee joint kinematics and kinetics in six degrees of freedom (DoF) during the loading phases of a jump lunge and side cut using this in silico method. Thirty-five healthy adults completed these movements and their surface marker trajectories were then scaled and processed with OpenSim's inverse kinematics (IK) and inverse dynamics tools. Knee flexion angle-dependent kinematic constraints defined based on previous bone pin (BP) marker trajectories were then applied to the OpenSim model during IK and these constrained results were then processed with the standard inverse dynamics tool. Significant differences for all hip, knee, and ankle DoF were observed after STA suppression for both the jump lunge and side cut. Using clinically relevant effect size estimates, we conclude that STA contamination had led to misclassifications in hip transverse plane angles, knee frontal and transverse plane angles, medial/lateral and distractive/compressive knee translations, and knee frontal plane moments between the NoBP and the BP IK solutions. Our results have substantial clinical implications since past research has used joint kinematics and kinetics contaminated by STA to identify risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The hand is comprised of 27smallmass segments. Because of the influence of the extrinsic finger muscles, the passive torques about each finger joint become a complex function dependent on the posture of multiple joints of the distal upper limb. However, biomechanical models implemented for the dynamic simulation of hand movements generally don't extend proximally to include the wrist and distal upper limb. Thus, they cannot accurately represent these complex passive torques. The purpose of this short communication is to both describe a method to incorporate the length-dependent passive properties of the extrinsic index finger muscles into a biomechanical model of the upper limb and to demonstrate their influence on combined movement of the wrist and fingers. Leveraging a unique set of experimental data, that describes the net passive torque contributed by the extrinsic finger muscles about the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger as a function of both metacarpophalangeal and wrist postures, we simulated the length-dependent passive properties of the extrinsic finger muscles. Dynamic forward simulations demonstrate that a model including these properties passively exhibits coordinated movement between the wrist and finger joints, mimicking tenodesis, a behavior that is absent when the length-dependent properties are removed. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating the length-dependent properties of the extrinsic finger muscles into biomechanical models to study healthy and impaired hand movements.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The first one is based on the angular integration (AI) of the strain energy on a unit sphere for the analytically defined fiber dispersion. The second one is based on the introduction of the generalized structure tensors (GST). AI approach is very involved computationally while GST approach requires somewhat complicated procedure for the exclusion of compressed fibers. We present some middle ground models, which are based on the use of 16 and 8 structure tensors. These models are moderately involved computationally and they allow excluding compressed fibers easily. We use the proposed models to study the role of the fiber dispersion in the constitutive modeling of the arterial wall. Particularly, we study the auxetic effect which can appear in anisotropic materials. The effect means thickening of the tissue in the direction perpendicular to its stretching. Such an effect was not observed in experiments while some simple anisotropic models do predict it. We show that more accurate account of the fiber dispersion suppresses the auxetic effect in a qualitative agreement with experimental observations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This anisotropic multiphysics damage model integrates the continuum mixture theory and a continuum damage model, and the anisotropic damage is considered by evolution of internal damage variables governing the anisotropic mechanical behaviors of tissues. The energy dissipation associated with the transport of fluid and ions is generally related to tissue damage. The anisotropic multiphysics damage model is applied to simulate a case of annulus fibrosus (AF) damage in an isolated intervertebral disc under compression, to understand the damage initiation and propagation. It is found that, for this case (with 1000N/s of compression rate and neglected ground matrix damage), the damage initiated in the outer and middle posterior regions of AF at about 700N of axial compression. The region-dependent yield stretch ratio predicted by this model is consistent with experimental findings. A sensitive study on the damage parameters is also presented.

A proof-of-principle for quantification of knee instability.,"Knee instability is a major problem in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury or knee osteoarthritis. A valid and clinically meaningful measure for functional knee instability is lacking. The concept of the gait sensitivity norm, the normalized perturbation response of a walking system to external perturbations, could be a sensible way to quantify knee instability. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of this concept for measurement of knee responses, using controlled external perturbations during walking in healthy subjects. Nine young healthy participants walked on a treadmill, while three dimensional kinematics were measured. Sudden lateral translations of the treadmill were applied at five different intensities during stance. Right knee kinematic responses and spatio-temporal parameters were tracked for the perturbed stride and following four cycles, to calculate perturbation response and gait sensitivity norm values (i.e. response/perturbation) in various ways. The perturbation response values in terms of knee flexion and abduction increased with perturbation intensity and decreased with an increased number of steps after perturbation. For flexion and ab/adduction during midswing, the gait sensitivity norm values were shown to be constant over perturbation intensities, demonstrating the potential of the gait sensitivity norm as a robust measure of knee responses to perturbations. These results show the feasibility of using the gait sensitivity norm concept for certain gait indicators based on kinematics of the knee, as a measure of responses during perturbed gait. The current findings in healthy subjects could serve as reference-data to quantify pathological knee instability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Further, prior work has not analyzed upper body kinematics. This study aims to investigate effects of slope on gait parameters using a self-paced TM (SPTM) which facilitates more natural walking, including measuring upper body kinematics and gait coordination parameters. Gait of 11 young healthy participants was sampled during walking in steady state speed. Measurements were made at slopes of +10°, 0° and -10°. Force plates and a motion capture system were used to reconstruct twenty spatiotemporal gait parameters. For validation, previously described parameters were compared with the literature, and novel parameters measuring upper body kinematics and bilateral gait coordination were also analyzed. Results showed that most lower and upper body gait parameters were affected by walking slope angle. Specifically, UH walking had a higher impact on gait kinematics than DH walking. However, gait coordination parameters were not affected by walking slope, suggesting that gait asymmetry, left-right coordination and gait variability are robust characteristics of walking. The findings of the study are discussed in reference to a potential combined effect of slope and gait speed.

These structures could be fluidized in response to transient mechanical cues. Ultrasound devices have been widely used in medicine which their generated ultrasonic waves could disrupt/fluidize actin filaments in cytoskeleton and thus could affect cellular organization. Present research aims at revealing the mechanism of fluidization caused by ultrasound induced strains. First, a numerical simulation was performed to reveal the effect of oscillating ultrasonic pressure on induced deformation in the cell with respect to different cell geometries and exposure conditions. The model revealed that higher pressure and frequencies induce higher levels of strain in the cell. The results also showed that spread cells are more exposed to cytomechanical remodeling due to higher level of ultrasound induced deformations but also the effect of harmonic excitation decreases with spreading. Furthermore, strain values found to be less in the nucleus comparing the value in the cytoplasm, but still these strains can affect the behavior of the cell through mechanotransduction mechanisms. Then, different experimental ultrasound protocols were used to evaluate their effects on cell viability and actin cytoskeleton distribution. Results of Live/Dead assay indicated that high pressure and duration of the exposure had negative effects on the viability of C2C12 cells, while the viability ratio still remained above 85%. In addition, actin fluorescent staining showed that high levels of filament disruption could occur with increasing the pressure.

The infeasibility of measuring the in situ response and load paths of individual ligaments has precluded a complete characterization of their mechanical behavior via experiment. In the present study a fiber-based modeling approach of in situ ankle ligaments was developed and validated for determining the heterogeneous force-elongation characteristics and the consequent injury patterns. Nine major ankle ligaments were modeled as bundles of discrete elements, corresponding functionally to the structure of collagen fibers. To incorporate the progressive nature of ligamentous injury, the limit strain at the occurrence of fiber failure was described by a distribution function ranging from 12% to 18% along the width of the insertion site. The model was validated by comparing the structural kinetic and kinematic response obtained experimentally and computationally under well-controlled foot rotations. The simulation results replicated the 6 degree-of-freedom bony motion and ligamentous injuries and, by implication, the in situ deformations of the ligaments. Gross stiffness of the whole ligament derived from the fibers was comparable to existing experimental data. The present modeling approach provides a biomechanically realistic, interpretable and computationally efficient way to characterize the in situ ligament slack, sequential and heterogeneous uncrimping of collagen fascicles and failure propagation as the external load is applied. Applications of this model include functional ankle joint mechanics, injury prevention and countermeasure design for athletes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to (i) to assess the stationarity of the vibratory signal of the racket and hand and (ii) to identify the best mother wavelet to perform future time-frequency analysis, (iii) to determine if the stroke spin, racket characteristics and impact zone can influence the selection of the best mother wavelet. A total of 2364 topspin and flat forehand drives were performed by fourteen male competitive tennis players with six different rackets. One tri-axial and one mono-axial accelerometer were taped on the racket throat and dominant hand respectively. The signal stationarity was tested through the wavelet spectrum test. Eighty-nine mother wavelet were tested to select the best mother wavelet based on continuous and discrete transforms. On average only 25±17%, 2±5%, 5±7% and 27±27% of the signal tested respected the hypothesis of stationarity for the three axes of the racket and the hand respectively. Regarding the two methods for the detection of the best mother wavelet, the Daubechy 45 wavelet presented the highest average ranking. No effect of the stroke spin, racket characteristics and impact zone was observed for the selection of the best mother wavelet.

Altered patellofemoral contact forces are theorized to contribute to this pain. Musculoskeletal modeling has been employed to better understand the etiology of patellofemoral pain. Currently, there are no data on the effective quadriceps moment arm for individuals with patellofemoral pain, forcing researchers to apply normative values when modeling such individuals. In addition, the ratio of patellofemoral reaction force to quadriceps force is often used as a surrogate for patellofemoral joint contact force, ignoring the fact that the quadriceps efficiency can vary with pathology and intervention. Thus, the purposes of this study were to: (1) quantify the effective quadriceps moment arm in individuals with patellofemoral pain and compare this value to a control cohort and (2) develop a novel methodology for quantifying the normalized patellofemoral joint reaction force in vivo during dynamic activities. Dynamic MR data were captured as subjects with patellofemoral pain (30F/3M) cyclically flexed their knee from 10° to 40°. Data for control subjects (29F/9M) were taken from a previous study. The moment arm data acquired across a large cohort of individuals with patellofemoral pain should help advance musculoskeletal modeling. The primary finding of this study was an increased mean normalized patellofemoral reaction force of 14.9% (maximum values at a knee angle of 10°) in individuals with patellofemoral pain. Understanding changes in the normalized patellofemoral reaction force with pathology may lead to improvements in clinical decision making, and consequently treatments, by providing a more direct measure of altered patellofemoral joint forces.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Hence, the aim of this project was to develop new implantable force transducers for a biomechanical description of various aortic root repair techniques. Two novel force transducers were developed. Both transducers were manufactured using rapid prototyping and were instrumented with miniature strain gauges. Before implantation both transducers were calibrated using a dedicated setup, yielding very linear correlation between the applied load and transducer output. The developed force transducers were implanted and tested in an 80kg porcine model. In the post-cardioplegic heart, the peak annular forces varied in the range of 2-4N and the commissural forces varied from 0.4 to 0.8N with a left ventricular pressure of 111mmHg.

Thirteen patients were recruited in the clinical study, which involved distal retraction of maxillary canines with 1.5N (150g) force for 12weeks. In a split mouth study, vibration and non-vibration sides were randomly assigned to each subject. Vibration of 50Hz, of approximately 0.2N (20g) of magnitude, was applied on the buccal surface of maxillary canine for the vibration group. A mode-based steady-state dynamic finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted based on an anatomically detailed model, complying with the clinical protocol. Both the amounts of space closure and canine distalization of the vibration group were significantly higher than those of the control group, as measured intra-orally or on models (p<0.05). Therefore it is indicated that a 50Hz and 20g single-tooth vibration can accelerate maxillary canine retraction. The volume-average hydrostatic stress (VHS) in the periodontal ligament (PDL) was computationally calculated to be higher with vibration compared with the control group for maxillary teeth and for both linguo-buccal and mesial-distal directions. An increase in vibratory frequency further amplified the PDL response before reaching a local natural frequency. An amplification of PDL response was also shown to be induced by vibration based on computational simulation.

Individuals who have undergone limb salvage surgeries may require an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) to compensate for limb impairments and restore walking ability. Understanding the effects of AFO design parameters on gait biomechanics is important to refine AFO prescription criteria. In this study sagittal plane kinematic and kinetic data, muscle activity and alignment preference were examined as individuals treated for traumatic lower extremity injuries (N=12) walked over level ground with Plantarflexed (PF), Neutral, and Dorsiflexed (DF) aligned AFOs. A PF alignment resulted in earlier center of pressure progression (p<0.007) and a resulting decrease in both internal knee extensor moment (p<0.001) and quadriceps and soleus muscle activity (p<0.014) compared to the Neutral and DF alignments without affecting the lower limb support moment. A clear alignment preference was observed, with eight participants preferring the PF over the Neutral and DF alignments. The increase in internal knee extensor moment between the PF and DF alignments in the present study is consistent with previous investigations in other patient populations, suggesting a more DF aligned AFO may affect the knee joint moment similarly across patient populations. The results of this study suggest AFO alignment is an important design parameter that affects ankle and knee joint moments and muscle activity and should be carefully considered during AFO design and clinical fitting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For these calculations, plaque geometry from MRI is often used. Unfortunately, MRI is hampered by a low resolution, leading to an overestimation of cap thickness and an underestimation of PCS. We developed a model to reconstruct the cap based on plaque geometry to better predict cap thickness and PCS. We used histological stained plaques from 34 patients. These plaques were segmented and served as the ground truth. Sections of these plaques contained 93 necrotic cores with a cap thickness <0.62 mm which were used to generate a geometry-based model. The histological data was used to simulate in vivo MRI images, which were manually delineated by three experienced MRI readers. Caps below the MRI resolution (n = 31) were (digitally removed and) reconstructed according to the geometry-based model. Cap thickness and PCS were determined for the ground truth, readers, and reconstructed geometries. Cap thickness was 0.07 mm for the ground truth, 0.23 mm for the readers, and 0.12 mm for the reconstructed geometries. The model predicts cap thickness significantly better than the readers. PCS was 464 kPa for the ground truth, 262 kPa for the readers and 384 kPa for the reconstructed geometries. The model did not predict the PCS significantly better than the readers. The geometry-based model provided a significant improvement for cap thickness estimation and can potentially help in rupture-risk prediction, solely based on cap thickness.

Descriptive data on the aspects of site specific in vivo tendon strain with varying knee joint angle are non-existent. The present study determines and compares surface and deep layer strain of the patellar tendon during isometric contractions across a range of knee joint angles.


METHODS
Male participants (age 22.0±3.4) performed ramped isometric knee extensions at knee joint angles of 90°, 70°, 50° and 30° of flexion. Strain patterns of the anterior and posterior regions of the patellar tendon were determined using real-time B-mode ultrasonography at each knee joint angle. Regional strain measures were compared using an automated pixel tracking method.


RESULTS
Strain was seen to be greatest for both the anterior and posterior regions with the knee at 90° (7.76±0.89% and 5.06±0.76%). Anterior strain was seen to be significantly greater (p<0.05) than posterior strain for all knee angles apart from 30°, 90°=(7.76vs. 5.06%), 70°=(4.77vs. 3.75%), and 50°=(3.74vs. 2.90%). The relative strain (ratio of anterior to posterior), was greatest with the knee joint angle at 90°, and decreased as the knee joint angle reduced.


CONCLUSIONS
The results from this study indicate that not only are there greater absolute tendon strains with the knee in greater flexion, but that the knee joint angle affects the regional strain differentially, resulting in greater shear between the tendon layers with force application when the knee is in greater degrees of flexion. These results have important implications for rehabilitation and training.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze lower limb joint work and joint contribution of the hip, knee and ankle to total lower limb work during sloped walking in a healthy population. Eighteen male participants (27.0±4.7yrs, 1.80±0.05m, 74.5±8.2kg) walked on an instrumented ramp at inclination angles of 0°, ±6°, ±12° and ±18° at 1.1m/s. Kinematic and kinetic data were captured using a motion-capture system (Vicon) and two force plates (AMTI). Joint power curves, joint work (positive, negative, absolute) and each joint's contribution to total lower limb work were analyzed throughout the stance phase using an ANOVA with repeated measures. With increasing inclination positive joint work increased for the ankle and hip joint and in total during uphill walking. Negative joint work increased for each joint and in total work during downhill walking. Absolute work was increased during both uphill (all joints) and downhill (ankle & knee) walking. Knee joint contribution to total negative and absolute work increased during downhill walking while hip and ankle contributions decreased. This study identified, that, when switching from level to a 6° and from 6° to a 12° inclination the gain of individual joint work is more pronounced compared to switching from 12° to an 18° inclination. The results might be used for training recommendations and specific training intervention with respect to sloped walking.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One of the most prevalent gait patterns among children with CP, crouch gait, is often singled out as especially exhausting. The dynamics of crouch gait increase external flexion moments and the demand on extensor muscles. This elevated demand is thought to dramatically increase energy expenditure. However, the impact of crouch severity on energy expenditure has not been investigated among children with CP. We evaluated oxygen consumption and gait kinematics for 573 children with bilateral CP. The average net nondimensional oxygen consumption during gait of the children with CP (0.18±0.06) was 2.9 times that of speed-matched typically-developing peers. Crouch severity was only modestly related to oxygen consumption, with measures of knee flexion angle during gait explaining only 5-20% of the variability in oxygen consumption. While knee moment and muscle activity were moderately to strongly correlated with crouch severity (r2=0.13-0.73), these variables were only weakly correlated with oxygen consumption (r2=0.02-0.04). Thus, although the dynamics of crouch gait increased muscle demand, these effects did not directly result in elevated energy expenditure. In clinical gait analysis, assumptions about an individual's energy expenditure should not be based upon kinematics or kinetics alone. Identifying patient-specific factors that contribute to increased energy expenditure may provide new pathways to improve gait for children with CP.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Models are often developed using the anatomy of an individual subject. Average mechanical property values for the annulus and other soft tissue structures are typically utilized from the literature, as data for the same subject are not available. However, these properties can have significant variability. While probabilistic methods enable the impact of soft tissue property variability on spine mechanics to be assessed, they often require lengthy computation times. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to develop efficient methods to perform Monte Carlo simulations of a finite element model of the L4 L5 functional spinal unit considering variability in the properties of the soft tissue structures. Distributions for the soft tissue properties included the stiffness of spinal ligaments and parameters of a Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden constitutive material model of the disc. Variance reduction sampling methods, including the Sobol and Descriptive sampling techniques, were assessed for efficiency and accuracy in comparison to traditional random Monte Carlo sampling. Comparisons were based on output torque-rotation curves at the 10th and 90th percentile for flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending. The Descriptive sampling technique best matched the random sampling technique, at the extremes of rotation, with a 3.6% mean difference.

However, the uniarticular soleus (SOL) and the biarticular (GAS) function differently during walking, with in vivo evidence suggesting that their associated fascicles and tendinous structures exhibit unique kinematics during walking. Given the strong association between muscle fiber length, velocity and force production, we conjectured that SOL and GAS mechanics and energetic behavior would respond differently to altered AT compliance. To test this, we characterized GAS and SOL muscle and tendon mechanics and energetics due to systematic changes in tendon compliance using musculoskeletal simulations of walking. Increased tendon compliance enlarged GAS and SOL tendon excursions, shortened fiber operation lengths and affected muscle excitation patterns. For both muscles, an optimal tendon compliance (tendon strains of approximately 5% with maximum isometric force) existed that minimized metabolic energy consumption. However, GAS muscle-tendon mechanics and energetics were significantly more sensitive to changes in tendon compliance than were those for SOL. In addition, GAS was not able to return stored tendon energy during push-off as effectively as SOL, particularly for larger values of tendon compliance. These fundamental differences between GAS and SOL sensitivity to altered tendon compliance seem to arise from the biarticular nature of GAS. These insights are potentially important for understanding the functional consequences of altered Achilles tendon compliance due to aging, injury, or disease.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The accuracy of biomechanical models is predicated on the realism by which they represent their biomechanical tissues. Unfortunately, most models use phenomenological ligament models that neglect the behaviour in the failure region. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test whether a mechanistic model of ligamentous tissue portrays behaviour representative of actual ligament failure tests.


MODEL
The model tracks the time-evolution of a population of collagen fibres in a theoretical ligament. Each collagen fibre is treated as an independent linear cables with constant stiffness. Model equations were derived by assuming these fibres act as a continuum and applying a conservation law akin to Huxley's muscle model. A breaking function models the rate of collagen fibre breakage at a given displacement, and was chosen to be a linear function for this preliminary analysis.


METHODS
The model was fitted to experimental average curves for the cervical anterior longitudinal ligament. In addition, the model was cyclically loaded to test whether the tissue model behaves similarly.


RESULTS
The model agreed very well with experiment with an RMS error of 14.23 N and an R2 of 0.995. Cyclic loading exhibited a reduction in force similar to experimental data.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The proposed model showcases behaviour reminiscent of actual ligaments being strained to failure and undergoing cyclic load. Future work could incorporate viscous effects, or validate the model further by testing it in various loading conditions. Characterizing the breaking function more accurately would also lead to better results.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The most commonly used buffer solution is a physiological concentration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS); however, PBS increases the tissue's water content and decreases its tensile stiffness. In addition, solutes from the buffer can diffuse into the tissue and interact with its structure and mechanics. These bathing solution effects can confound the outcome and interpretation of mechanical tests. Potential bathing solution artifacts, including solute diffusion, and their effect on mechanical properties, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to measure the effects of long-term exposure of rat tail tendon fascicles to several concentrations (0.9-25%) of NaCl, sucrose, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and SPEG (NaCl+PEG) solutions on water content, solute diffusion, and mechanical properties. We found that with an increase in solute concentration the apparent water content decreased for all solution types. Solutes diffused into the tissue for NaCl and sucrose, however, no solute diffusion was observed for PEG or SPEG. The mechanical properties changed for both NaCl solutions, in particular after long-term (8h) incubation the modulus and equilibrium stress decreased compared to short-term (15min) for 25% NaCl, and the cross sectional area increased for 0.9% NaCl. However, the mechanical properties were unchanged for both PEG and SPEG except for minor alterations in stress relaxation parameters. This study shows that NaCl and sucrose buffer solutions are not suitable for long-term mechanical tests. We therefore propose using PEG or SPEG as alternative buffer solutions that after long-term incubation can maintain tissue hydration without solute diffusion and produce a consistent mechanical response.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Rheology co-factors such as a high hematocrit and a high shear rate are known to promote platelet mass transport toward the vessel wall. Hemodynamic conditions promoting RBC aggregation may also favor platelet migration, particularly in the venous system at low shear rates. The aim of this study was to confirm experimentally the impact of RBC aggregation on platelet-sized micro particle migration in a Couette flow apparatus. Biotin coated micro particles were mixed with saline or blood with different aggregation tendencies, at two shear rates of 2 and 10s-1 and three hematocrits ranging from 20 to 60%. Streptavidin membranes were respectively positioned on the Couette static and rotating cylinders upon which the number of adhered fluorescent particles was quantified. The platelet-sized particle adhesion on both walls was progressively enhanced by increasing the hematocrit (p<0.001), reducing the shear rate (p<0.001), and rising the aggregation of RBCs (p<0.001). Particle count was minimum on the stationary cylinder when suspended in saline at 2s-1 (57±33), and maximum on the rotating cylinder at 60% hematocrit, 2s-1 and the maximum dextran-induced RBC aggregation (2840±152). This fundamental study is confirming recent hypotheses on the role of RBC aggregation on venous thrombosis, and may guide molecular imaging protocols requiring injecting active labeled micro particles in the venous flow system to probe human diseases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, while recent findings stressed the importance of multi-segment analysis, most of prior gait studies modelled the lumbar spine as one segment, when it was not the entire trunk that was considered as a single segment. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive multi-segment research that could improve our understanding of CLBP pathomechanism and thus possibly contribute to better care for CLBP. This study aimed at characterizing the angle patterns at the lower lumbar (LLS), upper lumbar (ULS), lower thoracic (LTS) and upper thoracic (UTS) joints in the three anatomical planes and at comparing CLBP patients and asymptomatic subjects. Spinal kinematics of 11 CLBP patients and 11 controls was measured using a marker-based motion capture system and described according to a previously proposed multi-segment biomechanical model. Characteristic patterns were observed at the UTS, LTS and ULS joints in the transverse plane and at the UTS, ULS and LLS joints in the frontal plane. CLBP patients walked with smaller frontal-plane LLS range of motion than controls. The results also suggested that patients had more asymmetrical LTS motion in the transverse plane. In conclusion, this work extended prior literature by showing specific CLBP-related alterations in multi-segment spinal kinematics during gait. Further research is necessary to understand the factors influencing kinematics alterations and how treatment strategies might improve motor behaviour in CLBP patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The ability of FLS to sense and respond to these stimuli plays a key role in their normal function, and is implicated in the alterations to function that occur in osteoarthritis (OA). The present work characterizes the response of FLS to fluid flow-induced shear stress via real-time calcium imaging, and tests the hypothesis that this response is modulated by interleukin-1α (IL-1α), a cytokine elevated in OA. FLS demonstrated a robust calcium signaling response to fluid shear that was dose dependent upon stress level and required both external and internal calcium sources. Preconditioning with 10ng/mL IL-1α for 24h heightened this shear stress response by significantly increasing the percent of responding cells and peak magnitude, while significantly decreasing the time for a peak to occur. Intercellular communication via gap junctions was found to account for a portion of the FLS population response in normal conditions, and was significantly increased by IL-1α preconditioning. IL-1α was also found to significantly increase average length and incidence of the primary cilium, an organelle commonly implicated in shear mechanosensing. These findings suggest that the elevated levels of IL-1α found in the OA environment heighten FLS sensitivity to fluid shear by altering both intercellular communication and individual cell sensitivity, which could affect downstream functions and contribute to progression of the disease state.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The viscoelasticity is considered within three time regimes: (1) short time regime for milliseconds to seconds time scale which corresponds to sub-cellular level; (2) middle time regime for several tens of seconds to several minutes time scale which corresponds to cellular level; and (3) long time regime for several tens of minutes to several hours time scale which corresponds to supra-cellular level. Short and middle time regimes have been successfully elaborated in the literature, whereas long time viscoelasticity remains unclear. Long time regime accounts for collective cell migration. Collective cell migration could induce uncorrelated motility which has an impact to energy storage and dissipation during cell surface rearrangement. Uncorrelated motility influences: (1) volume fraction of migrating cells, (2) distribution of migrating cells, (3) shapes of migrating cell groups. These parameters influence mechanical coupling between migrating and resting subpopulations and consequently the constitutive model for long time regime. This modeling consideration indicates that additional experimental work is needed to confirm the feasibility of constitutive models which have been applied in literature for long time regime as: (1) relaxation of stress and strain, (2) storage and loss moduli as the function of time, (3) distribution of migrating cells.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A neuromuscular imbalance called leg dominance may provide a biomechanical explanation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the side-to-side lower limb differences in movement patterns, muscle forces and ACL forces during a single-leg drop-landing task from two different heights. We hypothesized that there will be significant differences in lower limb movement patterns (kinematics), muscle forces and ACL loading between the dominant and non-dominant limbs. Further, we hypothesized that significant differences between limbs will be present when participants land from a greater drop-landing height. Eight recreational female participants performed dominant and non-dominant single-leg drop landings from 30 to 60cm. OpenSim software was used to develop participant-specific musculoskeletal models and to calculate muscle forces. We also predicted ACL loading using our previously established method. There were no significant differences between dominant and non-dominant leg landing except in ankle dorsiflexion and GMED muscle forces at peak GRF. Landing from a greater height resulted in significant differences among most kinetics and kinematics variables and ACL forces. Minimal differences in lower-limb muscle forces and ACL loading between the dominant and non-dominant legs during single-leg landing may suggest similar risk of injury across limbs in this cohort. Further research is required to confirm whether limb dominance may play an important role in the higher incidence of ACL injury in female athletes with larger and sport-specific cohorts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Multiple overlapping uncovered stents (MOUS) system has shown potentials in managing complex aortic aneurysms with side branches involvement. It promotes the development of thrombus by modulating local flow pattern that reduces the wall tension, while maintaining patency of side branches. However the modulation of local hemodynamic parameters depends on various factors that have not been assessed comprehensively.


METHODS
Aneurysm 3D geometry was reconstructed based on CT images. One-way fluid-structure interaction analysis was performed to quantify structural stress concentration in the wall, and changes of blood velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), relative residence time (RRT) and pressure in the sac due to the stent deployment.


RESULTS
High structural stress concentration due to stent deployment was found in the landing zone and it increased linearly with the number of stents deployed. The wall tension in the sac was unaffected by the stent deployment. Stress within the wall was insensitive to the different overlapping pattern. After one stent was deployed, the mean flow velocity in the sac reduced by 36.4%. The deployment of the 2nd stent further reduced the mean sac velocity by 10%. WSS decreased while both OSI and RRT increased after stent deployment, however pressure in the sac remained nearly unchanged. Except for the cases with complete stents struts alignment, different overlapping pattern had little effect on flow parameters.


CONCLUSIONS
Mechanical parameters modulated by the MOUS are insensitive to different overlapping pattern suggesting that endovascular procedure can be performed with less attention to the overlapping pattern.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here we report cell stiffness alteration by changing the cell substrate stiffness for isolated cells and cells in contact with other cells. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used to prepare soft substrates with three different stiffness values (173, 88 and 17kPa respectively). Breast cancer cells lines, namely HBL-100, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 with different level of aggressiveness are cultured on these substrates and their local elasticity is investigated by vertical indentation of the cell membrane. Our preliminary results show an unforeseen behavior of the MDA-MB-231 cells. When cultured on glass substrate as isolated cells, they are less stiff than the other two types of cells, in agreement with the general statement that more aggressive and metastatic cells are softer. However, when connected to other cells the stiffness of MDA-MB-231 cells becomes similar to the other two cell lines. Moreover, the stiffness of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured on soft PDMS substrates is significantly higher than the stiffness of the other cell types, demonstrating thus the strong influence of the environmental conditions on the mechanical properties of the cells.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Toward addressing such a research gap, a case-control study was conducted to explore the differences in lower back mechanical loads between a group of females (n=19) with non-chronic, non-specific LBP and a group of asymptomatic females (n=19). The differences in lower back mechanical loads were determined when participants completed one symmetric lowering and lifting of a 4.5kg load at their preferred cadence. The axial, shearing, and moment components of task demand at the time of peak moment component as well as measures of peak trunk kinematics were analyzed. Patient vs. asymptomatic group performed the task with smaller peak thoracic rotation and peak lumbar flexion. While no differences in the moment component of task demand on the lower back between the patients and controls were found, the shearing (40-50 age group) and axial components of task demand were, respectively, larger and smaller in patients vs.


CONTROLS
Whether alterations in lower back loads in patients with non-chronic LBP are in response to pain or preceded the pain, the long-term exposure to abnormal lower back mechanics may adversely affect spinal structure and increase the likelihood of further injury or pain. Therefore, the underlying reason(s) as well as the potential consequence(s) of such altered lower back mechanics in patients with non-chronic LBP should to be further investigated.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

They may help revealing a sub-optimal cardiac function that is not evident in terms of tissue motion, which is naturally heterogeneous and variable, and can influence cardiac adaptation. However, hemodynamic forces are not utilized in clinical cardiology due to the unavailability of simple non-invasive measurement tools. Hemodynamic forces depend on the intraventricular flow; nevertheless, most of them are imputable to the dynamics of the endocardial flow boundary and to the exchange of momentum across the mitral and aortic orifices. In this study, we introduce a simplified model based on first principles of fluid dynamics that allows estimating hemodynamic forces without knowing the velocity field inside the LV. The model is validated with 3D phase-contrast MRI (known as 4D flow MRI) in 15 subjects, (5 healthy and 10 patients) using the endocardial surface reconstructed from the three standard long-axis projections. Results demonstrate that the model provides consistent estimates for the base-apex component (mean correlation coefficient r=0.77 for instantaneous values and r=0.88 for root mean square) and good estimates of the inferolateral-anteroseptal component (r=0.50 and 0.84, respectively). The present method represents a potential integration to the existing ones quantifying endocardial deformation in MRI and echocardiography to add a physics-based estimation of the corresponding hemodynamic forces. These could help the clinician to early detect sub-clinical diseases and differentiate between different cardiac dysfunctional states.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Treatments and aging affect these micro-structural features. We previously demonstrated decreased fatigue life with an unexplained mechanism and decreased osteon size in cortical bone treated with high-dose bisphosphonate. Here, three finite element models were examined: type-1: a single osteon, as a homogeneous unit and with heterogeneous lamellae and interlamellae, type-2: a control, interstitial-only tissue and type-3: the osteon with cement line, set within the interstitial tissue. Models were loaded in simulated, sinusoidal bending fatigue. As osteon size was decreased, lamellar number and lamellar thickness were incrementally adjusted for each model. As hypothesized, lamellae within the larger type-1 models attained greater cycles to failure and the addition of an osteon to type-2 models (generating a type-3 model set) yielded increased fatigue life. However, as the osteon size was decreased, the potential for compressive damage nucleation was increased within the lamellae of the osteons versus the interstitium. Also, osteons with fewer, thicker lamellae displayed increased fatigue life. Osteonal microstructure plays a role in damage initiation location, especially when BMU size is smaller. Previous findings by us and others could partially be explained by this further understanding of increased probability for damage nucleation in smaller osteons.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the proper establishment of such a conclusion would require biophysical understanding of the underlying mechanism of the cell stiffness. In this work, we compared the elastic moduli of the actin cytoskeletons of Hey A8 ovarian carcinoma cells with and without metastasis (HM and NM), as measured by 2D atomic force microscopy (AFM) with low-depth nanoindentation via a rate-jump method. The results indicate clearly that HM cells showed lower actin cytoskeleton stiffness atop of their nucleus position and higher actin cytoskeleton stiffness at their rims, compared to NM cells, suggesting that the local stiffness on the cytoskeleton can reflect actin filament distribution. Immunofluorescence staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also indicated that the difference in stiffness in Hey A8 cells with different metastasis is associated with their F-actin rearrangement. Finite-element modelling (FEM) shows that a migrating cell would have its actin filaments bundled together to form stress fibers, which would exhibit lower indentation stiffness than the less aligned arrangement of filaments in a non-migrating cell. The results here indicate that the actin cytoskeleton stiffness can serve as a reliable marker for grading the metastasis of adherent carcinoma cells due to their cytoskeleton change and potentially predicting the migration direction of the cells.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False
