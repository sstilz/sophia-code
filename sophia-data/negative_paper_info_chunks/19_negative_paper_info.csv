However, these tools, in the context of pediatric head injury, have yet to be validated due to a paucity of pediatric head response data. The goal of this study is to investigate the response and injury tolerance of the pediatric head to impact. Twelve pediatric heads were impacted in a series of drop tests. The heads were dropped onto five impact locations (forehead, occiput, vertex and right and left parietal) from drop heights of 15 and 30 cm. The head could freely fall without rotation onto a flat 19 mm thick platen. The impact force was measured using a 3-axis piezoelectric load cell attached to the platen. Age and drop height were found to be significant factors in the impact response of the pediatric head. The head acceleration (14-15 cm; 103-30 cm), Head Injury Criterion (HIC) (253-15 cm; 154-30 cm) and impact stiffness (5800-15 cm; 3755-30 cm) when averaged across all impact locations increased with age from 33 weeks gestation to 16 years, while the pulse duration (66-15 cm; 53-30 cm) decreased with age. Increases in head acceleration, HIC and impact stiffness were also observed with increased drop height, while pulse duration decreased with increased drop height. One important observation was that three of the four cadaveric heads between the ages of 5-months and 22-months sustained fractures from the 15 cm and 30 cm drop heights. The 5-month-old sustained a right parietal linear fracture while the 11- and 22-month-old sustained diastatic linear fractures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To gain better insight into roles of GSLs, we studied the effects of GSL-deletion on the physiological responses of chondrocytes to mechanical stress. Mice lacking Ugcg gene (Ugcg-/-) were genetically generated to obtain GSL-deficient mice, and their chondrocytes from the joints were used for functional analyses in vitro culture experiments. The cells were seeded in a three-dimensional collagen gel and subjected to 5%, 10% or 16% cyclic tensile strain for either 3 or 24 h. The gene expressions of chondrocyte anabolic and catabolic factors, and the induction of Ca2+ signaling were analyzed. Our results revealed that chondrocytes derived from GSL-deficient mice exhibited an elevation in the expression of catabolic factors (ADAMTS-5, MMP-13) following the exposure to strain with amplitudes of 10%. Likewise, applying cyclic tensile strain with these amplitudes resulted in an increased Ca2+ oscillation ratio in chondrocytes from GSL-deficient as compared to the ratio from control mice. These results demonstrated that deletion of GSL stimulated the catabolic responses of chondrocytes to mechanical stress via the augmentation of the sensitivity to mechanical stress that may lead to the cartilage deterioration. These findings suggest that the regulation of the physiological responses of chondrocytes by GSLs could be a potential target in a therapeutic intervention in osteoarthritis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

There is an incomplete understanding of the complex function and interaction between the cervix and uterus. This, in part, is due to the limited research into multiaxial biomechanical functions and geometry of these organs. Knowledge of the biomechanical function and interaction between these organs may elucidate etiologies of conditions such as preterm birth. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the multiaxial biomechanical properties of the murine cervix and uterus using a biaxial testing set-up. To accomplish this, an inflation-extension testing protocol (n = 15) was leveraged to quantify biaxial biomechanical properties while preserving native matrix interactions and geometry. Ultrasound imaging and histology (n = 10) were performed to evaluate regional geometry and microstructure, respectively. Histological analysis identified a statistically significant greater collagen content and significantly smaller smooth muscle content in the cervix as compared to the uterus. No statistically significant differences in elastic fibers were identified. Analysis of bilinear fits revealed a significantly stiffer response from the circumferentially orientated ECM fibers compared to axially orientated fibers in both organs. Bilinear fits and a two-fiber family constitutive model showed that the cervix was significantly less distensible than the uterus. We submit that the regional biaxial information reported in this study aids in establishing an appropriate reference configuration for mathematical models of the uterine-cervical complex. Thus, may aid future work to elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms leading to cervical or uterine conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies have shown increased vibration intensity and damping coefficient within the soft tissue with fatigue. The question of this study was to investigate if the vibration settling time remains constant during a prolonged running. Eleven semi-professional middle/long distance runners ran to exhaustion on a treadmill with their preferred constant speed (4.29 ± 0.33 m/s) for 3873 ± 1147 m. Vibration of the gastrocnemius lateralis, electrical activity of the tibialis anterior and the gastrocnemius medialis along with ground reaction force (GRF) were recorded. The results demonstrated significant increase in impact peak and loading rate, and the frequency content of the impact, with no significant change in active peak of the vertical GRF. Fatigue resulted in increased vibration intensity, damping coefficient, and energy dissipation of vibration with no change in vibration settling time. Furthermore, peak acceleration significantly linearly (R = 0.59) increased as a function of running time. The mean frequency of muscle activity of the gastrocnemius medialis and the intensity of muscle activity in TA significantly decreased. The results suggest that constant vibration settling time might either be an objective for muscle tuning which is more pronounced in fatigued state or a passive by-product of muscle function in running. Further studies are needed to address this point.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, both the application and language of the mechanical constructs are not always adhered to when applied to biological systems, which can lead to errors and misunderstandings within the scientific literature. Here we address three topics that seem to be common points of confusion and misconception, with a specific focus on sports biomechanics applications: (1) joint reaction forces as they pertain to loads actually experienced by biological joints; (2) the partitioning of scalar quantities into directional components; and (3) weight and gravity alteration.

However, this procedure involves the risk of a higher complication rate. In order to reduce the occurrence of re-ruptures and pathological tendon extensions, a tendon reconstruction with the highest possible primary stability is desirable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if augmentation using synthetic polyester tapes (QuadsTape™) could provide greater primary stability in case of different tendon suture techniques. 90 tendons of the superficial toe flexor of pigs were divided into 9 groups. The reconstruction method was combined using the factors suture technique (Kessler and Bunnell), augmentation (non-augmented and augmented with QuadsTape™) and defect type (end-to-end and 10 mm gap). The biomechanical measurements were performed on a material testing machine and consisted of a creep test, a cyclic test and a tear-off test. This study compared creep strain, ultimate load failure, maximum stress and stiffness. Irrespective of the type of defect involved, augmentation of the tendon sutures led to a significant increase of the maximum force (not augmented: 82.30 ± 25.48 N, augmented: 135.73 ± 30.69 N, p < 0.001) and the maximum stress (not augmented: 2.26 ± 0.83 MPa, augmented: 4.13 ± 1.79 MPa, p < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a non-significant increase in stiffness and no significant differences were observed with respect to creep strain. Augmentation of Achilles tendon reconstruction using QuadsTape™ increases composite strength and stiffness in the in vitro model, thus potentially contributing to the feasibility of early rehabilitation programs. Biological factors still need to be investigated in order to formulate appropriate indications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We developed a computational model of the microvascular perfusion in the calf muscles. We included 20 patients (10 PAD, 10 controls) and utilized the geometry, mean signal intensity and arterial input functions from CE-MRI calf muscle perfusion scans. The model included the microvascular pressure (pv), outflow filtration coefficient (OFC), transfer rate constant (kt), porosity (φ), and the interstitial permeability (Ktissue). Parameters were fitted and the simulations were compared across PAD patients and controls. Intra-observer reproducibility of the simulated mean signal intensities was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.995). kt and Ktissue were higher in PAD patients compared with controls (4.72 interquartile range (IQR) 3.33, 5.56 vs. 2.47 IQR 2.10, 2.85; p = 0.003; and 3.68 IQR 3.18, 4.41 vs. 1.81 IQR 1.81, 1.81; p < 0.001).

Numerous knee kinematic models of different complexity, with either generic or subject-specific anatomy, have been presented and used to predict three-dimensional tibiofemoral (TFJ) and patellofemoral (PFJ) joint kinematics of cadavers or healthy adults, but not pediatric populations. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop subject-specific TFJ and PFJ kinematic models, with TFJ models having either rigid or extensible ligament constraints, for eight healthy pediatric participants and (ii) to validate the estimated joint and ligament kinematics against in vivo kinematics measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at four TFJ flexion angles. Three different TFJ models were created from MRIs and used to solve the TFJ kinematics: (i) 5-rigid-link parallel mechanism with rigid surface contact and isometric anterior cruciate (ACL), posterior cruciate (PCL) and medial collateral (MCL) ligaments (ΔLnull), (ii) 6-link parallel mechanism with minimized ACL, PCL, MCL and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) length changes (ΔLmin) and (iii) 6-link parallel mechanism with prescribed ACL, PCL, MCL and LCL length variations (ΔLmatch). Each model's geometrical parameters were optimized using a Multiple Objective Particle Swarm algorithm. When compared to MRI-measured data, ΔLnull and ΔLmatch performed the best, with average root mean square errors below 6.93° and 4.23 mm for TFJ and PFJ angles and displacements, respectively, and below 2.01 mm for ligament lengths (<4.32% ligament strain). Therefore, within these error ranges, ΔLnull and ΔLmatch can be used to estimate three-dimensional pediatric TFJ, PFJ and ligament kinematics and can be incorporated into lower-limb models to estimate joint kinematics and kinetics during dynamic tasks.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Radiographic classification systems group patients by the presence or absence of these gross anatomical features but are poorly correlated to function. Statistical-shape modelling (SSM) can detect subtle differences in 3D-bone geometry, providing an opportunity for accurate predictive models. The aim of this study was to describe and quantify the main modes of shape variation which distinguish end-stage OA from asymptomatic knees. Seventy-six patients with OA and 77 control participants received a CT of their knee. 3D models of the joint were created by manual segmentation. A template mesh was fitted to all meshes and rigidly aligned resulting in a set of correspondent meshes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to create the SSM. Logistic regression was performed on the PCA weights to distinguish morphological features of the two groups. The first 7 modes of the SSM captured >90% shape variation with 6 modes best distinguishing between OA and asymptomatic knees. OA knees displayed sub-chondral bone expansion particularly in the condyles and posterior medial tibial plateau of up to 10 mm. The model classified the two groups with 95% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, 94% specificity, and 97% AUC. There were distinct features which differentiated OA from asymptomatic knees.

There is evidence that rehabilitation produces important gains on balance and gait. However, responsiveness to rehabilitation of balance and gait measures is unknown in PNLL. Aim of the current work is to evaluate the responsiveness to rehabilitation of balance, gait and sensory ataxia measures in elderly with PNLL. Twenty-five elderly with PNLL attending physiotherapy and occupational therapy during inpatient rehabilitation were recruited. Balance and gait measures (including static posturography, TUG test and the 10 m walking test) were administered on admission and discharge. An accelerometer secured to the trunk was used for TUG recording and static balance assessment. Static balance was tested with open and closed eyes, so as to assess sensory ataxia. Following rehabilitation, patients improved gait [admission vs discharge, mean(SD): 0.86(0.33) vs 0.98(0.32) m/s], TUG [18.7(7.8) vs 15.1(5.2) s] and turning [46.2(15.3) vs 53.3(15.3) °/s]. However, none of 12 static balance parameters derived from trunk acceleration significantly changed. Principal component analysis showed that before training, eyes closed and eyes open balance correlated with orthogonal components (one and two vs. three and four). After training, eyes open and eyes closed balance were more similar to each other being both correlated with component one. Responsiveness to rehabilitation is larger for gait than static balance measured by trunk acceleration. However, exercise can also have a beneficial effect on sensory ataxia by making eyes closed balance more similar to eyes open balance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the face analysis domain suffers from a lack of valid motion capture protocol, due to the complexity of the human face. Indeed, a framework for defining the optimal marker set layout does not exist yet and, up to date, researchers still use their traditional facial point sets with manually allocated markers. Therefore, the study proposes an automatic approach to compute a minimum optimized marker layout to be exploited in facial motion capture, able to simplify the marker allocation without decreasing the significance level. Specifically, the algorithm identifies the optimal facial marker layouts selecting the subsets of linear distances among markers that allow to automatically recognizing with the highest performances, through a k-nearest neighbours classification technique, the acted facial movements. The marker layouts are extracted from them. Various validation and testing phases have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness and usefulness of the custom approach.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In principle, more detailed information could be obtained non-invasively based on space- and time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow) data. Yet the limitations of this imaging technique require testing the accuracy of 4D flow-derived hemodynamic quantities against other methodologies. With the objective of assessing the feasibility and accuracy of this non-invasive method to support the clinical diagnosis of CoA, we developed an algorithm (4DF-FEPPE) to obtain relative pressure distributions from 4D flow data by solving the Poisson pressure equation. 4DF-FEPPE was tested against results from a patient-specific fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation, whose patient-specific boundary conditions were prescribed based on 4D flow data. Since numerical simulations provide noise-free pressure fields on fine spatial and temporal scales, our analysis allowed to assess the uncertainties related to 4D flow noise and limited resolution. 4DF-FEPPE and FSI results were compared on a series of cross-sections along the aorta. Bland-Altman analysis revealed very good agreement between the two methodologies in terms of instantaneous data at peak systole, end-diastole and time-averaged values: biases (means of differences) were +0.4 mmHg, -1.1 mmHg and +0.6 mmHg, respectively. Limits of agreement (2 SD) were ±0.978 mmHg, ±1.06 mmHg and ±1.97 mmHg, respectively. Peak-to-peak and maximum trans-coarctation pressure drops obtained with 4DF-FEPPE differed from FSI results by 0.75 mmHg and -1.34 mmHg respectively. The present study considers important validation aspects of non-invasive pressure difference estimation based on 4D flow MRI, showing the potential of this technology to be more broadly applied to the clinical practice.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Intimal flap fenestration and blood pressure are clinically relevant variables in this pathology, yet their effects on dissection hemodynamics are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to characterize these effects on flow in dissection models to better guide interventions to prevent aneurysm formation and false lumen flow. Silicone models of aortic dissection with mobile intimal flap were fabricated based on patient images and installed in a flow loop with pulsatile flow. Flow fields were acquired via 4-dimensional flow MRI, allowing for quantification and visualization of relevant fluid mechanics. Pulsatile vortices and jet-like structures were observed at fenestrations immediately past the proximal entry tear. False lumen flow reversal was significantly reduced with the addition of fenestrations, from 19.2 ± 3.3% in two-tear dissections to 4.67 ± 1.5% and 4.87 ± 1.7% with each subsequent fenestration. In contrast, increasing pressure did not cause appreciable differences in flow rates, flow reversal, and vortex formation. Increasing the number of intermediate tears decreased flow reversal as compared to two-tear dissection, which may prevent false lumen thrombosis, promoting persistent false lumen flow. Vortices were noted to result from transluminal fluid motion at distal tear sites, which may lead to degeneration of the opposing wall. Increasing pressure did not affect measured flow patterns, but may contribute to stress concentrations in the aortic wall. The functional and anatomic assessment of disease with 4D MRI may aid in stratifying patient risk in this population.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While models are often used to better understand injury mechanisms, experimental data for their validation remain sparse, particularly regarding articular facets. The aim of this study was to assess the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion with a specific focus on facet tracking. 9 cadaveric cervical FSUs were imaged and loaded under a 10 Nm flexion moment, exerted incrementally, while biplanar X-rays were acquired at each load increment. The relative vertebral and facet rotations and displacements were assessed using radio-opaque markers implanted in each vertebra and CT-based reconstructions registered on the radiographs. The only failures obtained were due to specimen preparation, indicating a failure moment of cervical FSUs greater than 10 Nm in quasistatic flexion. Facet motions displayed a consistent anterior sliding and a variable pattern regarding their normal displacement. The present study offers insight on the behavior of cervical FSUs under quasi-static flexion beyond physiological thresholds with accurate facet tracking.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the primary risk factor for glaucoma, is thought to induce abnormally high strains in optic nerve head (ONH) tissues, which ultimately result in retinal ganglion cell damage and vision loss. The mechanisms by which excessive deformations result in vision loss remain incompletely understood. The ability of computational and in vitro models of the ONH to provide insight into these mechanisms, in many cases, depends on our ability to replicate the physiological environment, which in turn requires knowledge of tissue biomechanical properties. The majority of mechanical data published to date regarding the ONH has been obtained from tensile testing, yet compression has been shown to be the main mode of deformation in the ONH under elevated IOP. We have thus tested pig and rat ONH tissue using unconfined cyclic compression. The material constants C1, obtained from fitting the stress vs. strain data with a neo-Hookean material model, were 428 [367, 488] Pa and 64 [53, 76] Pa (mean [95% Confidence Interval]) for pig and rat optic nerve head, respectively.

An alternative approach would be to capitalize on recent advances in deep learning. In this study, using the pre-trained CaffeNet convolutional neural network (CNN) model, multivariate regression of marker-based motion capture to 3D KJM for three sports-related movement types were compared. The strongest overall mean correlation to source modeling of 0.8895 was achieved over the initial 33% of stance phase for sidestepping.

The purpose of this study was to visualize the three-dimensional (3D) flow field in the wake region during human UUS in a water flume. A national level male swimmer performed 41 UUS trials in a water flume. A motion capture system and stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) equipment were used to investigate the 3D coordinates of the swimmer and 3D flow fields in the wake region. After one kick cycle was divided into eight phases, we conducted coordinate transformations and phase averaging method to construct quasi 3D flow fields. At the end of the downward kick, the lower limbs external rotations of the lower limbs were observed, and the feet approached towards each other. A strong downstream flow, i.e. a jet was observed in the wake region during the downward kick, and the paired vortex structure was accompanied by a jet. In the vortex structure, a cluster of vortices and a jet were generated in the wake during the downward kick, and the vortices were subsequently shed from the feet by the rotated leg motion. This suggested that the swimmer gained a thrust by creating vortices around the foot during the downward kick, which collided to form a jet.

Previous studies have shown that, in fatigue failure and damage of cartilage and fibrocartilage, shear loads could be one of the biggest contributors to the failure. The aim of the present study is to develop an evaluation method to study shear properties of the disc and to do a mathematical characterization of it. For the experiments, twelve porcine discs were used. Each disc was dissected from the TMJ and, then, static strain control tests were carried out to obtain the shear relaxation modulus for the central region of the discs. From the results, it was found that the disc presents a viscoelastic behavior under shear loads. Relaxation modulus decreased with time.

While mitral valve mechanics have been studied for many decades, traditional testing methods limit the spatial resolution of measurements and can be destructive. Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an emerging method for measuring viscoelastic properties of tissues in a noninvasive, nondestructive manner. In this study, we employed air-pulse OCE to measure the spatial variation in mitral valve elastic properties with micro-scale resolution at 1 mm increments along the radial length of the leaflets. We analyzed differences between the leaflets, as well as between regions of the valve. We found that the anterior leaflet has a higher elastic wave velocity, which is reported as a surrogate for stiffness, than the posterior leaflet, most notably at the annular edge of the sample. In addition, we found a spatial elastic gradient in the anterior leaflet, where the annular edge was found to have a greater elastic wave velocity than the free edge. This gradient was less pronounced in the posterior leaflet. These patterns were confirmed using established uniaxial tensile testing methods. Overall, the anterior leaflet was stiffer and had greater heterogeneity in its mechanical properties than the posterior leaflet. This study measures differences between the two mitral leaflets with greater resolution than previously feasible and demonstrates a method that may be suitable for assessing valve mechanics following repair or during the engineering of synthetic valve replacements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The two groups were evaluated before and 2 years after the procedure using Corvis ST (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Germany) and DCR parameters such as deformation amplitude ratio at 1 mm and 2 mm (DA ratio-1 mm and DA ratio-2 mm) and integrated radius and stiffness parameters at A1 (SP-A1). Two-year follow-up was completed for 16 of the 30 eyes in the 5-min group and 21 of the 25 eyes in the 10-min group; data from those who were lost to follow-up was not included in the analyses. Mean age at baseline was 21.7 ± 4.9 and 21.5 ± 5.2 years in the 5- and 10-min groups, respectively (P = 0.895). At 2 years after CXL, in the 5-min group, the reduction in integrated radius (-1.12 ± 1.27 mm, P = 0.003) was significant, and the increase in SP-A1 (7.11 ± 14.86 mmHg/mm, P = 0.075) was borderline, while in the 10-min group, the decrease in DA ratio-2 mm (-0.43 ± 0.58, P = 0.003) and integrated radius (-1.89 ± 1.72 mm, P < 0.001), and increase in SP-A1 (7.67 ± 10.92 mmHg/mm, P = 0.004) were significant. In both groups, the strongest and significant correlation was observed between DCR parameters and changes in radius of curvature.

Forty-nine runners performed a running protocol on a treadmill at comfortable velocity. Two systems were used to determine spatiotemporal parameters (i.e. contact time [CT], flight time [FT], step frequency [SF] and step length [SL]) during running: OptoGait system and high-speed video analysis at 1000 Hz. The collected data was re-filtered in the OptoGait software by using nine different settings (i.e. 0_0, 1_1, 2_2, 3_3, 3_4, 4_4, 4_5, 5_4 and 5_5), and compared to those obtained through video analysis. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed very large correlations (r > 0.9, p < 0.001) in CT, FT, SF and SL between both systems, regardless of the OptoGait's filter settings. The ICC reported an almost perfect association (ICC > 0.9) for both SL and SF regardless of the filter setting. However, large variations between filter settings according to the data from video analysis were reported in CT and FT (0_0, 1_1 and 2_2 filter settings obtained an association ICC > 0.9, whereas other filters obtained lower ICCs). Bland-Altman plots revealed small bias and error and no presence of heteroscedasticity of error for 1_1 setting. In conclusion, the filter setting for the OptoGait system should be considered to minimize the bias and error of spatiotemporal parameters measurement. For running on a treadmill, the 1_1 filter setting is recommended if gait parameters are to be compared to a high-speed video analysis (1000 Hz).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an orthosis inspired by the concept of a foot's twisted osteoligamentous plate on the kinematics of foot-ankle complex. Thirty-five subjects underwent a kinematic assessment of the foot-ankle complex during walking using three different orthoses: (1) Twisted Plate Spring (TPS) orthosis: inspired by the concept of a twisted osteoligamentous plate shape and made with a spring-like material (carbon fiber); (2) Flat orthosis: control orthosis made of a non-elastic material with a non-inclined surface; and (3) Rigid orthosis: control orthosis made of a non-elastic material, with the same shape of the TPS. Repeated measures analyses of variance demonstrated that the TPS reduced the duration and magnitude of rearfoot eversion (p ≤ 0.03), increased rearfoot inversion relative to shank (p < 0.01), increased forefoot eversion relative to rearfoot (p < 0.01), and increased peak of plantar flexion of forefoot relative to rearfoot during the propulsive phase (p = 0.01) compared to Flat orthosis. The effects of the TPS were different from the Rigid orthosis, demonstrating that, alongside shape, material properties were a determinant factor for the obtained results. The findings of this study help clarify the role of a mechanism similar to a twisted osteoligamentous plate on controlling foot pronation and facilitating supination during the stance phase of walking.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Different thresholds (1%, 2% or 5% of maximal) are indifferently used to set ""passive state"". This study aimed to investigate the effects of a slight activity on the joint and muscle mechanical properties during stretching. The joint torque and muscle shear modulus of the triceps surae muscles were measured in fifteen healthy volunteers during ankle dorsiflexions: (i) in a ""fully relaxed"" state, (ii) during active conditions where participants were asked to produce an sEMG amplitude of 1%, 2% or 5% of their maximal sEMG amplitude of the triceps surae. The 1% condition was the only that did not result in significant differences in joint torque or shear modulus compared to the relaxed condition. In the 2% condition, increases in joint torque were found at 80% of the maximal angle in dorsiflexion, and in the shear modulus of gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis at the maximal angle in dorsiflexion. During the 5% condition, joint torque and the shear modulus of gastrocnemius medialis were higher than during relaxed condition at angles larger than 40% of maximal angle in dorsiflexion. The results provide new insights on the thresholds that should be considered for the design of stretching studies. A threshold of 1% seems much more appropriate than a 2% or 5% threshold in healthy participants.

The trajectories of the swing foot are adjusted by coordination of the lower limbs, which is evaluated with uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis. A previous study that applied this analysis to walking revealed that older adults with fall history had compensatorily great segment coordination to stabilize the swing foot during normal walking. However, it is unknown whether the increase in segment coordination helps for preventing incident falls in the future. At baseline measurement, 30 older adults walked for 20 times at a comfortable speed. UCM analysis was performed to evaluate how the segment configuration in the lower limbs contributes to the swing foot stability. One year after the baseline visit, we asked the subjects if there were incident falls through a questionnaire. The univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the index of segment coordination and incident falls with and without adjustment for gait velocity. Twenty-eight older adults who responded to the questionnaire were classified into older adults (n = 12) who had the incident fall and those (n = 16) who did not have falls. It was revealed that older adults who increased the segment coordination associated with swing foot stability tended to experience at least one fall within one year of measurement.

It is not obvious how hindfoot (or rearfoot) axes defined by skin-mounted markers relate to the anatomy of the underlying bones. The aim of this study was to compare the marker-based axes of the hindfoot in a multi-segment foot model to the orientations of the talus and calcaneus as characterized by their principal axes of inertia. Twenty adult females with no known foot deformities had radio-opaque markers placed on their feet and ankles at the foot model marker locations. CT images of the feet were acquired as the participants lay supine with their feet in a semi-weight bearing posture. The spatial coordinates of the markers were obtained from the images and used to define the foot model axes. Segmented masks of the tali and calcanei were used to create 3D bone models, from which the principal axes of the bones were obtained. The orientations of the principal axes were either within the range of typical values reported in the imaging literature or differed in ways that could be explained by variations in how the angles were defined. The model hindfoot axis orientations relative to the principal axes of the bones had little bias but were highly variable.

Strength of the hip abductor muscle group is a predictor of overall function following THA. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hip abductor strengthening following rehabilitation on joint contact forces (JCFs) in the lower extremity and low back during a high demand step down task. Five THA patients performed lower extremity maximum isometric strength tests and a stair descent task. Patient-specific musculoskeletal models were created in OpenSim and maximum isometric strength parameters were scaled to reproduce measured pre-operative joint torques. A pre-operative forward dynamic simulation of each patient performing the stair descent was constructed using their corresponding patient-specific model to predict JCFs at the ankle, knee, hip, and low back. The hip abductor muscles were strengthened with clinically supported increases (0-30%) above pre-operative values in a probabilistic framework to predict the effects on peak JCFs (99% confidence bounds). Simulated hip abductor strengthening resulted in lower peak JCFs relative to pre-operative for all five patients at the hip (18.9-23.8 ± 16.5%) and knee (20.5-23.8 ± 11.2%). Four of the five patients had reductions at the ankle (7.1-8.5 ± 11.3%) and low back (3.5-7.0 ± 5.3%) with one patient demonstrating no change.

Morphometric data were obtained from digitized images of the segments at no-load and zero-stress states. Pressure and diameter changes were measured during flow and ramp distensions under active and passive experimental conditions. Circumferential stresses (force per area) and strains (deformation) were computed with referenced to the zero-stress state. The contraction frequency was analyzed. Contraction thresholds and maximum contraction amplitude were calculated in terms of mechanical stress and strain.

Current rTSA testing standards rely upon synthetic bone surrogates, but it is unclear if these models accurately recapitulate the mechanics of osteoporotic bone. Additionally, it also unknown if the use of a central screw effectively provides resistance to micromotion in the milieu of poor quality bone. The purpose of this experiment was to create a novel cyclic load test protocol that elicited clinically relevant failures, so that comparisons of relative motion between baseplates and bones could be made with: (1) synthetic bones and poor quality cadaveric bones, and (2) the use or omission of a central screw. rTSA components were implanted into cadaveric and synthetic bones with and without a central screw. To model a range of loads that may be experienced during abduction, increasing cyclic loads were applied to shoulder joints in 30° of humeral abduction. Cycles and loads prior to permanent deformation exceeding 150 µm, 1 mm, and joint failure were determined using measurements from the test frame and from 3-D motion analysis. Synthetic bones demonstrated significantly more resistance to micromotion in comparison to cadaveric bones.

However, the hemodynamic changes due to remodeling are poorly understood, despite their importance in surgical procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this study, a framework to simulate remodeling of the arterial network following pathological flow alterations was developed and applied to investigate the hemodynamic characteristics of patients with CA stenosis. A one-dimensional-zero-dimensional cardiovascular model was used for blood flow simulation. After introducing CA stenosis into the normal network, arterial remodeling was simulated by iteratively changing the diameter of each artery until time-averaged wall shear stress reached its value under normal conditions. A representative case was simulated to validate the present framework, followed by simulation cases to investigate the impact of stenosis severity on remodeling outcome. A markedly dilated arcade was observed whose diameter agreed well with the corresponding values measured in subjects with CA stenosis, confirming the ability of the framework to predict arterial remodeling. A series of simulations clarified how the geometry and hemodynamics after remodeling change with stenosis severity. In particular, the arterial remodeling and resulting blood flow redistribution were found to maintain adequate organ blood supply regardless of stenosis severity. Furthermore, it was suggested that flow conditions in patients with CA stenosis could be estimated from geometric factors, namely, stenosis severity and arcade diameter, which can be preoperatively and non-invasively measured using diagnostic medical images.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty-one patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD), iliac artery stenoses and an ultrasound based peak systolic velocity ratio between 2.5 and 5.0 underwent 3DRA and intra-arterial pressure measurements under hyperemic conditions. For each lesion, geometric properties were extracted from the 3DRA images using quantitative vascular analysis software. Hyperemic blood flow was estimated based on stenosis geometry using an empirical relation. The geometrical properties and hyperemic flow were used to estimate the pressure gradient by means of the geometry-based model. The predicted pressure gradients were compared with in vivo measured intra-arterial pressure measurements performed under hyperemic conditions. The developed geometry-based model showed good agreement with the measured hyperemic pressure gradients resulting in a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.86. The mean bias ± 2SD between the geometry-based model and in vivo measurements was comparable to results found by evaluating the actual computational fluid dynamics model (-1.0 ± 14.7 mmHg vs -0.9 ± 12.7 mmHg).

Inverse modeling schemes have been used to estimate specimen-specific ligament properties, where external joint forces are assumed to balance with internal ligament and contact forces. This study simplifies this assumption by adjusting experimental loads to remove internal contact forces. The purpose of this study was to use novel experimental loading in an inverse modeling scheme to estimate ligament slack lengths, perform validation using additional loading scenarios, and evaluate sensitivity to the applied loading. Joint kinematics and kinetics were experimentally measured for a set of load cases. An optimization scheme used a specimen-specific forward kinematics model to estimate ligament slack lengths by minimizing the residual between model and experimentally measured kinetics. The calibrated model was used for a form of validation by evaluating non-optimized load cases. Additionally, uncertainty analysis related kinetic errors to previously reported kinematic errors. The six DOF tibial reactions realized RMS errors less than 23 N and 0.75 Nm for optimized load cases, and 33 N and 2.25 Nm for the non-optimized load cases. The uncertainty analysis, which was performed using the optimized load cases, showed average kinetic RMS errors less than 26 N and 0.45 Nm. The model's recruitment patterns were similar to those found in clinical and cadaveric studies.

Previous observational studies have suggested that there may be a relationship between step width and STJ supination moment. This study directly tests the hypothesis that walking with a step width greater than preferred would reduce STJ moments, energy absorption, and power generation requirements, while increasing energy absorption at the hip during initial contact. Participants (n = 12, 7 females) were asked to walk on an instrumented treadmill at a constant velocity and cadence at a range of fixed step widths ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 times leg length (L). Walking at step widths greater than preferred (0.149 ± 0.04 L) reduced peak STJ moments at initial contact and propulsion which subsequently reduced the negative and positive work performed at the STJ. There was a 43% reduction in energy absorption (negative work) and approximately 30% decrease in positive work at the STJ as step width increased from 0.1 L to 0.4 L. An increase in energy absorption at the knee and hip was evident with an increase in step width during initial contact, although minimal mechanical changes were observed at the proximal joints during propulsion. These results suggest an increase in step width reduces the forces generated by muscles at the STJ across stance and is therefore likely to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of their injuries. In terms of rehabilitation, the increase in mechanical costs occurring due to an increase in energy absorption by the hip and knee is of minimal concern.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Bridging vein (BV) ruptures is a major cause of ASDH. The KTH finite element head model includes bridging veins to predict acute subdural hematoma due to BV rupture. In this model, BVs were positioned according to Oka et al. (1985). The aim of the current study is to investigate whether the location and entry angles of these BVs could be modelled using data from a greater statistical sample, and what the impact of this improvement would be on the model's predictive capability of BV rupture. From the CT angiogram data of 78 patients, the relative position of the bridging veins and their entry angles along the superior sagittal sinus was determined. The bridging veins were repositioned in the model accordingly. The performance of the model, w.r.t. BV rupture prediction potential was tested on simulations of full body cadaver head impact experiments. The experiments were simulated on the original version of the model and on three other versions which had updated BV positions according to mean, maximum and minimum entry angles. Even though the successful prediction rate between the models stayed the same, the location of the rupture site significantly improved for the model with the mean entry angles. Moreover, the models with maximum and minimum entry angles give an insight of how BV biovariability can influence ASDH. In order to further improve the successful prediction rate, more biofidelic data are needed both with respect to bridging vein material properties and geometry. Furthermore, more experimental data are needed in order to investigate the behaviour of FE head models in depth.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Femoral soft tissue stiffness was measured from a large sample, and compared how this was affected by age, gender and site. One hundred fifty healthy individuals (fifty-two young (aged between 19 and 29), forty-eight middle-aged (30-64), and fifty old (over 65)) participated. Each age group included an equal number of males and females. Using an automated hand-held indentation device, soft tissue stiffness was measured over twelve sites with respect to the greater trochanter (GT). For both left and right hips, the stiffness was associated with age (p < 0.0005), gender (p < 0.0005), and site (p < 0.0005). On average, the stiffness was 26% greater in older than young adults (321.5 versus 254.3 N/m). On average across twelve sites, the regression analysis indicated that the stiffness increases 1.33 N/m every year (""soft tissue stiffness over the hip = 1.33*age + 221.8""; R = 0.518, p < 0.0005). Furthermore, the stiffness was 18% greater in male than female (308.8 versus 262.6 N/m), and differed across twelve sites over the hip, being greatest (424.2 N/m) at the GT, and least (206.3 N/m) at the superior gluteal region. The results provide insights into the shock absorbing property of soft tissue over the hip, and inform the improvement of fall-related injury prevention interventions (i.e., hip protector, safe landing strategies) in older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, the plantar tissues were divided into eight regions to account for the various tissue characteristics. The plantar tissue model described each region as an ellipsoid, with a viscoelastic material model. The model combined varying elliptical contact areas with nonlinear tissue stiffness and damping. The main instruments used in this research were pressure-measuring insoles, which were used to determine the ground reaction force, as well as contact areas. The measured contact areas were fitted as elliptical areas to describe the compression of the corresponding ellipsoids. The approach was tested using walking data collected from 26 individuals: four men, 22 women, 24.4 ± 6.9 years old, 66.9 ± 21.4 kg of mass, 1.66 ± 0.12 m tall. The geometric and material variables of the proposed ellipsoidal model were optimized for each participant to match the ground reaction forces. Results suggest that the ellipsoid model is able to reproduce ground reaction force with reasonable accuracy. The largest errors were seen in heel and toe regions and were due to high-rate forces and small comparative areas, respectively. The model also showed that there are regional differences in the mechanical characteristics of plantar tissue, which confirms earlier research.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigates whether spatiotemporal, foot clearance and stride-to-stride variability analysis can discriminate VaP, and responsiveness to levodopa. Fifteen healthy subjects, 15 Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) patients and 15 VaP patients, were assessed in two phases: before (Off-state), and one hour after (On-state) the acute administration of a suprathreshold (1.5 times the usual) levodopa dose. Participants were asked to walk a 30-meter continuous course at a self-selected walking speed while wearing foot-worn inertial sensors. For each gait variable, mean, coefficient of variation (CV), and standard deviations SD1 and SD2 obtained by Poincaré analysis were calculated. General linear models (GLMs) were used to identify group differences. Patients were subject to neuropsychological evaluation (MoCA test) and Brain MRI. VaP patients presented lower mean stride velocity, stride length, lift-off and strike angle, and height of maximum toe (later swing) (p < .05), and higher %gait cycle in double support, with only the latter unresponsive to levodopa. VaP patients also presented higher CV, significantly reduced after levodopa. Yet, all VaP versus IPD differences lost significance when accounting for mean stride length as a covariate. In conclusion, VaP patients presented a unique gait with reduced degrees of foot clearance, probably correlated to vascular lesioning in dopaminergic/non-dopaminergic cortical and subcortical non-dopaminergic networks, still amenable to benefit from levodopa. The dependency of gait and foot clearance and variability deficits from stride length deserves future clarification.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The majority of these injuries occur during running; however, the relationship between running mechanics and hamstring injury is unclear. Obtaining large samples of prospective injury data to examine this relationship is difficult, and therefore exploratory analysis frameworks may assist in deriving valuable information from studies with small but novel samples. The aim of this study was to undertake a prospective exploratory analysis of the relationship between running mechanics and hamstring injury. Kinematic and kinetic data of the trunk, pelvis and lower limbs were collected during maximal overground running efforts for ten elite rugby union athletes. Subsequently, hamstring injury occurrence was recorded for the following Super Rugby season, during which three athletes sustained a running-based hamstring injury. Functional principal component analysis was used to visualise patterns of variability in running mechanics during the late swing phase between athletes. Results indicated that subsequently injured athletes demonstrated a tendency for greater thoracic lateral flexion, greater hip extension moments and greater knee power absorption, compared to uninjured athletes. All variables demonstrated an ability to descriptively differentiate between injured and uninjured athletes at approximately 60% of the late swing phase. Therefore, we hypothesize that greater thoracic lateral flexion, a greater hip extension moment and greater knee power absorption between peak hip flexion and peak knee extension during the late swing phase may put rugby athletes at greater risk of running-based hamstring injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, injury rates are high in climbing populations, especially in the upper extremity and shoulder. Despite likely arising from an arboreal, climbing ancestor and being closely related to primates that are highly proficient climbers, the modern human shoulder has devolved a capacity for climbing. Limited biomechanical research exists on manual climbing performance. This study assessed kinematic and muscular demands during a bimanual climbing task that mimicked previous work on climbing primates. Thirty participants were recruited - 15 experienced and 15 inexperienced climbers. Motion capture and electromyography (EMG) measured elbow, thoracohumeral and trunk angles, and activity of twelve shoulder muscles, respectively, of the right-side while participants traversed across a horizontal climbing apparatus. Statistical parametric mapping was used to detect differences between groups in kinematics and muscle activity. Experienced climbers presented different joint motions that more closely mimicked the kinematics of climbing primates, including more elbow flexion (p = 0.0045) and internal rotation (p = 0.021), and less thoracohumeral elevation (p = 0.046). Similarly, like climbing primates, experienced climbers generally activated the shoulder musculature at a lower percentage of maximum, particularly during the exchange from support to swing and swing to support phase. However, high muscle activity was recorded in all muscles in both participant groups. Climbing experience coincided with a positive training effect, but not enough to overcome the high muscular workload of bimanual climbing. Owing to the evolved primary usage of the upper extremity for low-force, below shoulder-height tasks, bimanual climbing may induce high risk of fatigue-related musculoskeletal disorders.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Biplane videoradiography (BVR) has allowed investigators to study dynamic activities in the knee, hip, and shoulder joint; however, currently, BVR has not been utilized for the wrist joint because of the challenges associated with imaging multiple overlapping bones. Therefore, our aim was to develop a BVR procedure and to quantify its accuracy for evaluation of wrist kinematics. BVR was performed on six cadaveric forearms for one neutral static and six dynamic tasks, including flexion-extension, radial-ulnar deviation, circumduction, pronation, supination, and hammering. Optical motion capture (OMC) served as the gold standard for assessing accuracy. We propose a feedforward tracking methodology, which uses a combined model of metacarpals (second and third) for initialization of the third metacarpal (MC3). BVR-calculated kinematic parameters were found to be consistent with the OMC-calculated parameters, and the BVR/OMC agreement had submillimeter and sub-degree biases in tracking individual bones as well as the overall joint's rotation and translation. All dynamic tasks (except pronation task) showed a limit of agreement within 1.5° for overall rotation, and within 1.3 mm for overall translations. Pronation task had a 2.1° and 1.4 mm limit of agreement for rotation and translation measurement. The poorest precision was achieved in calculating the pronation-supination angle, and radial-ulnar and volar-dorsal translational components, although they were sub-degree and submillimeter.

Functional decline frequently occurs during hospitalization, resulting in a loss of Independence in activities of daily living after discharge. The aim of the study was to assess the functional decline in different ADLs of hospitalized elderly patients in an Acute Care for Elderly (ACE) unit incorporating a body-worn inertial sensor and accompanying custom algorithms. 38 hospitalized older adults (age ≥ 75) were included. The patients completed different functional tasks, including a balance test, Gait Velocity Test (GVT), verbal and arithmetic dual-task gait, and a sit-to-stand ability test at admission and discharge. Movement-related parameters were acquired from a unique tri-axial inertial sensor unit. Maximal muscle strength and muscle power output endpoints were also assessed. The results indicated that significant improvements (p < 0.05) were found at discharge compared with the admission values for gait variability and spatiotemporal parameters in the 4- and 6-meter GVT. These significant gains were also obtained in the verbal GVT. In contrast, a significant reduction was found in the functional status measured with the Barthel Index scale. Regarding to the sit-to-stand ability, lower peak power was observed in the sit-to-stand phase of the task at discharge. In conclusion, inertial sensor unit and our custom, validated, algorithms represent a feasible tool for measuring and monitoring functional trajectory during hospitalization in older adults and they are sensitive to detect differences in movement pattern parameters in different ADLs such as walking and the ability to stand from a seated position.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study aimed to quantify these errors by comparing data when max-ROM was obtained from the joint position data, as usual (max-ROMPOS), to data where max-ROM was defined as the first point of dynamometer arm deceleration (max-ROMACC). Fifteen participants performed isokinetic ankle joint max-ROM tests at 5, 30 and 60° s-1. Max-ROM, peak passive joint moment, end-range musculo-articular (MAC) stiffness and area under the joint moment-position curve were calculated. Greater max-ROM was observed in max-ROMPOS than max-ROMACC (P < 0.01) at 5 (0.2 ± 0.15%), 30 (1.8 ± 1.0%) and 60° s-1 (5.9 ± 2.3%), with the greatest error at the fastest velocity. Peak passive moment was greater and end-range MAC stiffness lower in max-ROMPOS than in max-ROMACC only at 60° s-1 (P < 0.01), whilst greater elastic energy storage was found at all velocities. Max-ROM and peak passive moment are affected by the delay between button press and eventual stopping of joint rotation in an angular velocity-dependent manner. This affects other variables calculated from the data. When high data accuracy is required, especially at fast joint rotation velocities (≥30° s-1), max-ROM (and associated measures calculated from joint moment data) should be taken at the point of first change in acceleration rather than at the dynamometer's ultimate joint position.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Walking stability appears to be related to walking speed, although the exact relationship is unclear. As walking speed decreases, the double support (DS) period of gait increases both in time and as a percentage of the gait cycle. Because humans have more control over their center of mass movement during DS, increasing DS duration may alter stability. This study examined how human gait is affected by changing DS percentage independent of walking speed. Sixteen young, healthy adults walked on a treadmill at a single speed for six one-minute trials. These trials included normal gait as well as longer- and shorter-than-normal DS percentage gaits. Subjects were consistently able to decrease DS percentage but had difficulty increasing DS percentage. In some cases, subjects altered their cadence when changing DS percentage, particularly when attempting to increase DS percentage. The changes to gait when decreasing DS percentage were similar to changes when increasing walking speed but occurred mainly during the swing period. These changes include increased hip and knee flexion during the swing period, increased swing foot height, and larger magnitude peaks in ground reaction forces. The changes in gait when attempting to increase DS percentage trended toward changes when decreasing walking speed. Altering DS percentage induced gait changes that were similar to, yet clearly distinct from, gait changes due to walking speed. Further, the difficulty of increasing DS percentage when walking at a constant speed suggests that people walk more slowly when they want to increase time spent in DS.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, when designing a new experiment, it remains unclear whether holes should be cut in footwear to permit motion tracking via skin-mounted markers, or whether marker placement locations should be tightly controlled across conditions. Here we provide data to assist researchers in answering these questions. We performed a gait analysis study of walking (0.8, 1.2, 1.6 m·s-1) and running (2.6, 2.8, 3.0 m·s-1) while subjects (N = 10) wore custom-modified footwear, which allowed markers to be placed either on the shoe, or on the skin via cut-out windows in the shoes. First, we compared foot markers affixed to the skin vs. on the same locations on the shoe. Using statistical non-parametric mapping techniques, we discovered that skin vs. shoe markers had no statistically significant effect on net AJC power estimates throughout stance phase, for all walking and running speeds. Second, we compared calcaneal markers in the nominal shoe configuration vs. markers in a nearby location (∼27 mm below) on the shoe. We observed significant differences when marker placement on the shoe was varied, which may be relevant to repeated-measures study designs. The results suggest that when computing AJC power for walking and running, you may want to put down the scissors (i.e., forego cutting holes in your footwear), and instead pick up a Sharpie® (pen) or use a template, to maintain consistent marker placement across trials and conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Data extracted from such tests are often used to develop and validate anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs), which function as human surrogates in tests for injury assessment. Given that the location and orientation of installed instrumentation differs between subjects, nominally similar measurements made on different PMHS must be transformed to standardized, skeletal-based local coordinate systems (LCS) before appropriate data comparisons can be made. Standardized PMHS LCS that correspond to ATD instrumentation locations and orientations have not previously been published. This paper introduces anatomically-defined PMHS LCS for body regions in which kinematic measurements are made using ATDs. These LCS include the head, sternum, single vertebrae, pelvis, femurs (distal and proximal), and tibiae (distal and proximal) based upon skeletal landmarks extracted from whole body CT scans. The proposed LCS provide a means to standardize the reporting of PMHS data, and facilitate both the comparison of PMHS impact data across institutions and the application of PMHS data to the development and validation of ATDs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

By contrast, isometric force is increased following active lengthening compared to a reference isometric contraction at the same muscle length and level of activation; this is termed rFE. To date, there have been no investigations of rFD and rFE in human muscle fibres, therefore the purpose of this study was to determine whether rFD and rFE occur at the single muscle fibre level in humans. rFD and rFE were investigated in maximally activated single muscle fibres biopsied from the vastus lateralis of healthy adults. To induce rFD, fibres were activated and shortened from an average sarcomere length (SL) of 3.2-2.6 μm. Reference isometric contractions were performed at an average SL of 2.6 μm. To induce rFE, fibres were actively lengthened from an average SL of 2.6-3.2 μm and a reference isometric contraction was performed at an average SL of 3.2 μm. Isometric steady-state force was lower following active shortening (p < 0.05), and higher following active lengthening (p < 0.05), as compared to the reference isometric contractions.

It has been reported that statistical parametric mapping's (SPM's) probability values can be invalid for such cases. The purpose of this paper was to clarify the scope of validity for SPM analysis of nonuniformly and heterogeneously smooth one-dimensional (1D) data. We simulated a variety of nonuniformly and heterogeneously smooth Gaussian 1D data over a range of smoothness values, and computed Type I error rates across 10,000 simulation iterations for each smoothness type. Results showed that, in all cases, SPM accurately controlled error at the prescribed α=0.05. Moreover, the distribution of false positives was uniform across time, implying that all regions are equally likely to produce false positives, irrespective of local roughness. We nevertheless show that cluster-level inferences (i.e., p values specific to local regions of significance), while never exceeding alpha (by definition), may be over-or-underestimated by approximately 0.01 for the currently simulated scenarios. We conclude that SPM's null hypothesis rejection decisions are valid for both nonuniform and heterogeneous 1D data, but that clusters' p values may be marginally too small/large in rough/smooth regions, respectively. Since cluster-level p values never exceed α, these p value errors are negligible for hypothesis testing purposes. Nevertheless, inter-cluster p value comparisons should be avoided.

Cubic-Hermite finite element meshes have been used for simulating cardiac biomechanics due to their convergence characteristics and their ability to capture smooth geometries compactly-fewer elements are needed to build the cardiac geometry-compared to linear tetrahedral meshes. Such meshes have previously been used only with simple ventricular geometries with non-physiological boundary conditions due to challenges associated with creating cubic-Hermite meshes of the complex heart geometry. However, it is critical to accurately capture the different geometric characteristics of the heart and apply physiologically equivalent boundary conditions to replicate the in vivo heart motion. In this work, we created a four-chamber cardiac model utilizing cubic-Hermite elements and simulated a full cardiac cycle by coupling the 3D finite element model with a lumped circulation model. The myocardial fiber-orientations were interpolated within the mesh using the Log-Euclidean method to overcome the singularity associated with interpolation of orthogonal matrices. Physiologically equivalent rigid body constraints were applied to the nodes along the valve plane and the accuracy of the resulting simulations were validated using open source clinical data. We then simulated a complete cardiac cycle of a healthy heart and a heart with acute myocardial infarction. We compared the pumping functionality of the heart for both cases by calculating the ventricular work. We observed a 20% reduction in acute work done by the heart immediately after myocardial infarction.

Four different optimization methods estimated muscle activation and musculotendon forces of a scaled-generic musculoskeletal model for each child walking, i.e. (i) static optimization that minimized summed-excitation squared; (ii) static optimization with maximum isometric muscle forces scaled to body mass; (iii) an EMG-assisted approach using optimization to minimize summed-excitation squared while reducing tracking errors of experimental EMG-linear envelopes and joint moments; and (iv) EMG-assisted with musculotendon model parameters first personalized by calibration. Both static optimization approaches showed a relatively low model performance compared to EMG envelopes. EMG-assisted approaches performed much better, especially in CP, with only a minor mismatch in joint moments. Calibration did not affect model performance significantly, however it did affect musculotendon forces, especially in CP. A model more consistent with experimental measures is more likely to yield more physiologically representative results. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of calibrated EMG-assisted modelling when estimating musculotendon forces in TD children and even more so in children with CP.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In elite play, the most common mechanism is impact to the head by an opposing player's upper limb, with shoulder-to-head impacts accounting for twice as many concussions as elbow- and hand-to-head impacts combined. Improved understanding of the biomechanics of head impacts in hockey may inform approaches to prevention. In this study, we measured the magnitude and duration of linear and rotational head accelerations when hockey players (n = 11; aged 21-25) delivered checks ""as hard as comfortable"" to the head of an instrumented dummy with their shoulder, elbow and hand. There were differences in both peak magnitude and duration of head accelerations across upper limb impact sites, based on repeated-measures ANOVA (p < 0.005). Peak linear head accelerations averaged 1.9-fold greater for hand and 1.3-fold greater for elbow than shoulder (mean values = 20.35, 14.23 and 10.55 g, respectively). Furthermore, peak rotational head accelerations averaged 2.1-fold greater for hand and 1.8-fold greater for elbow than shoulder (1097.9, 944.1 and 523.1 rad/s2, respectively). However, times to peak linear head acceleration (a measure of the duration of the acceleration impulse) were 2.1-fold longer for shoulder than elbow, and 2.5-fold longer for shoulder than hand (12.26, 5.94 and 4.98 ms, respectively), and there were similar trends in the durations of rotational head acceleration. Our results show that, in body checks to the head delivered by varsity-level hockey players, shoulder-to-head impacts generated longer durations but lower magnitude of peak head acceleration than elbow- and hand-to-head impacts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This simple spring model, however, only describes the CoM during the stance phase, and the mechanics involved in the bipedality of the human gait are limited. In this study, a bipedal spring walking model was proposed to demonstrate the dynamics of bipedal walking, including swing dynamics followed by the step-to-step transition. The model consists of two springs with different stiffnesses and rest lengths representing the stance leg and swing leg. One end of each spring has a foot mass, and the other end is attached to the body mass. To induce a forward swing that matches the gait phase, a torsional hip joint spring was introduced at each leg. To reflect the active knee flexion for foot clearance, the rest length of the swing leg was set shorter than that of the stance leg, generating a discrete elastic restoring force. The number of model parameters was reduced by introducing dependencies among stiffness parameters. The proposed model generates periodic gaits with dynamics-driven step-to-step transitions and realistic swing dynamics. While preserving the mimicry of the CoM and ground reaction force (GRF) data at various gait speeds, the proposed model emulated the kinematics of the swing leg. This result implies that the dynamics of human walking generated by the actuations of multiple body segments is describable by a simple spring mechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to quantify 3D joint work at the hip, knee, and ankle during slope walking. Work was calculated for ten males (23.9 ± 1.1 years) walking at a self-selected speed on inclines and declines (-20, -12, -6, 0, 6, 12, 20 degrees). Sagittal positive work significantly increased at the hip, knee, and ankle for incline walking (for example, hip positive work increased 153%, 280%, and 453% for 6, 12, and 20 degrees, respectively; knee and ankle positive work also increased) (p ≤ 0.05), in order to raise and propel the body forward.

Changes in peak moments due to CoP error have been reported in the literature. However, debate exists as to what levels of error are acceptable. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of CoP error on the kinetic profiles of children with typical development (TD) and children with cerebral palsy (CP) during gait. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were recorded and simulated CoP errors were applied at 3 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, 12 mm increments in both positive and negative anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. Absolute differences in maximum kinetic parameters between increments were assessed in conjunction with changes in the Gait Deviation Index-Kinetic (GDI-Kinetic). Changes in GDI-Kinetic above 3.6 points were considered clinically significant. Maximum peak changes of up to 24.8% (CP) and 34.7% (TD) (sagittal plane) and up to 36.8% (CP) and 61.5% (TD) (coronal plane) were demonstrated at the knee. While absolute percentage differences were high at some error increments, GDI-Kinetic results suggested that such large percentage differences may still be clinically acceptable. Children with TD demonstrated clinically significant changes in GDI-Kinetic for CoP displacements of 9 mm and 12 mm, corresponding to 23% and 35% absolute differences in maximum moments. In contrast, the clinically significant threshold was not reached for children with CP that may be related to a slower walking speed.

Changes in haemodynamics of the diabetic aortas remain largely unclear and relevant computational analyses are lacking in the literature. Ten adult rabbits (1.6-2.2 kg) were collected and the type I diabetic rabbit model was induced by injection of alloxan. A total of five control and five diabetic rabbit aortas were considered for subsequent numerical simulation. The CT scanning was performed to reconstruct three-dimensional model of the individual rabbit descending aorta. The flow velocity waveforms were measured by ultrasound machine and were set to be the inlet boundary conditions. The reconstructed aortas were then imported into ANSYS to perform mesh generation and computational analysis. Results showed that the distributions of haemodynamic indicators time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillating shear index (OSI) and transverse wall shear stress (transWSS) in the non-diabetic rabbit aortas were similar to those in the diabetic rabbit aortas. However, the mean values of TAWSS and transWSS in the non-diabetic rabbit aortas were significantly higher than those values in the diabetic rabbit aortas (TAWSS: p = 0.04; transWSS: p = 0.02). The back of right renal artery tended to have high OSI in both the non-diabetic and the diabetic rabbit aortas. Notably, the regions with high OSI tended to have intense disturbed flow and low TAWSS in the most diabetic rabbit aortas. The results suggest that diabetes leads to changes in haemodynamic parameters in the rabbit aortas.

Thus, there is a need for experimental comparisons between tissue and simulant materials under the same experimental conditions. This study compares the response of porcine brain tissue and a variety of brain tissue simulants in quasi-static and sinusoidal compression tests. Fresh porcine brain tissue was obtained from a local abattoir and tested within 4 h post mortem. Additionally, the effect of post mortem time was investigated by comparing samples stored at room temperature and stored frozen (-18 °C), at various time intervals.

The experiments were performed using a DMA apparatus (TA Instruments Q800). The quasi-static compression data were fit to Ogden hyperelastic functions so that parameters could be compared. It was found that bovine gelatin at 3% and 5% concentration demonstrated the closest response to brain tissue in quasi-static compression. Conversely, in sinusoidal compression, the agarose gel and Sylgard 527 were found to be in closer agreement with the tissue, than bovine gel.

We recently found that this preference arises not just through evolution and development, but that the nervous system will continuously optimize step frequency in response to new energetic cost landscapes. Here we tested whether energy optimization is also a major objective in the nervous system's real-time control of step width using a device that can reshape the relationship between step width and energetic cost, shifting people's energy optimal step width. We accomplished this by changing the walking incline to apply an energetic penalty as a function of step width. We found that people didn't spontaneously initiate energy optimization, but instead required experience with a lower energetic cost step width. After initiating optimization, people adapted, on average, 3.5 standard deviations of their natural step width variability towards the new energy optimal width. Within hundreds of steps, they updated this as their new preferred width and rapidly returned to it when perturbed away. This new preferred width reduced energetic cost by roughly 14%, however, it was slightly narrower than the energetically optimal width, possibly due to non-energy objectives that may contribute to the nervous system's control of step width. Collectively, these findings suggest that the nervous systems of able-bodied people can continuously optimize energetic cost to determine preferred step width.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A greater proportion of the top 50% of women maintained NRFS than amongst the bottom 50%. The proportion of RFS increased with distance run in the men's race, although more than 75% of athletes across both marathons had consistent footstrike patterns between laps (79 RFS and 36 NRFS). As most athletes were RFS (including the top four finishing men), there appears to be no clear advantage to NRFS in marathon running. Coaches should note that it is normal for elite marathon runners to be either RFS or NRFS; however, forefoot striking was rare.

In this study, SO was enhanced through an open-access MATLAB interface, where calculated muscle activations can additionally satisfy crucial mechanical stability requirements. This Stability-Constrained SO (SCSO) is applicable to many OpenSim models and can potentially produce more biofidelic results than SO alone, especially when antagonistic muscle co-contraction is required to stabilize body joints. This hypothesis was tested using existing models and experimental data in the literature. Muscle activations were calculated by SO and SCSO for a spine model during two series of static trials (i.e. simulation 1 and 2), and also for a lower limb model (supplementary material 2). In simulation 1, symmetric and asymmetric flexion postures were compared, while in simulation 2, various external load heights were compared, where increases in load height did not change the external lumbar flexion moment, but necessitated higher EMG activations. During the tasks in simulation 1, the predicted muscle activations by SCSO demonstrated less average deviation from the EMG data (6.8% -7.5%) compared to those from SO (10.2%). In simulation 2, SO predicts constant muscle activations and forces, while SCSO predicts increases in the average activations of back and abdominal muscles that better match experimental data. Although the SCSO results are sensitive to some parameters (e.g. musculotendon stiffness), when considering the strategy of the central nervous system in distributing muscle forces and in activating antagonistic muscles, the assigned activations by SCSO are more biofidelic than SO.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The blood-borne cells are in direct contact with the inner layer of endothelium, formed by a highly compliant layer of endothelial cells. The effect of endothelial stiffness on the adhesion and motion of rolling cells is poorly understood. Inspired by recent in vitro studies, here we implemented a computational method to model the specific adhesion of a rolling cell onto a soft substrate, subjected to a creeping shear flow. The substrate is modeled as an elastic half-space, coated with P- and E-selectin receptors with specific affinity for the complementary ligands located on the moving cell. Of particular importance is to predict the effect of substrate stiffness on cell adhesion and its kinematics and kinetics of motion. Simulation results show that the effect of substrate compliance is minimal when coated with P-selectin. Conversely, the trajectory of rolling cells on E-selectin coated substrates is sensitive to the substrate compliance. This is attributed to the moderation of binding forces applied by the soft substrate which leads to a higher average translational velocity of cells.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fourteen well-trained male swimmers (21.1 ± 1.7 yrs) performed maximal 50 m front crawl swimming with (W) and without (WO) 25 reflective markers attached to their skin and swimwear. This number represents the minimum required to estimate the body's center of mass. Fifty meter swimming time, mid-pool swimming velocity, stroke rate, and stroke length were determined using video analysis. We found swimming time to be 3.9 ± 1.6% longer for W condition. Swimming velocity (3.3 ± 1.8%), stroke rate (1.2 ± 2.0%), and stroke length (2.1 ± 2.7%) were also significantly lower for W condition. To elucidate whether the observed reduction in performance was potentially owing to an additional drag force induced by the reflective markers, measured swimming velocity under W condition was compared to a predicted velocity that was calculated based on swimming velocity obtained under WO condition and an estimate of the additional drag force induced by the reflective markers. The mean prediction error and ICC (2,1) for this analysis of measured and predicted velocities was 0.014 m s-1 and 0.894, respectively. Reducing the drag force term led to a decrease in the degree of agreement between the velocities. Together, these results suggest that the reduction in swimming performance resulted, at least in part, from an additional drag force produced by the reflective markers.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, it is currently unclear how sex may influence kinematic differences previously reported in runners with patellofemoral pain. This case-control study aimed to evaluate lower limb kinematics in males and females with and without patellofemoral pain during prolonged running. Materials and methods Lower limb 3D kinematics were sampled in 20 runners with PFP (11 females, 9 males) and 20 asymptomatic runners (11 females, 9 males) during a 3 km treadmill run. Data were analysed when mean-pooled as mixed sex groups (PFP versus control) and as individual sex sub-groups. Results Mixed-sex runners with PFP were found to have significantly greater peak hip adduction (mean difference=4.9°, d=0.91, 95% CI 1.4–8.2, p=0.01) when compared to matched controls.

Females with PFP ran with greater peak hip adduction compared to female controls (mean difference=6.6°, p=0.02, F=3.41, 95% CI 0.4–12.8), but not males with or without PFP. Analyses of sub-group comparisons for all other kinematic variables were non-significant.

Although step width variability, as measured by standard deviation, has been hypothesized to be associated with falls to the side, there is little supporting evidence. The extent to which such a relationship could be reliably established, however, is dependent on the accuracy with which step width, and thus step width variability, is measured. It has been reported that 400 consecutive steps are required to accurately estimate step width of young adults during treadmill walking. The degree to which this requirement generalizes to other populations has not been determined. Here, a secondary analysis of step width time series data from 19 middle-age women during treadmill walking revealed that 400 steps were insufficient to accurately estimate step width or step width variability for the majority of the women sampled. Patterns observed in the data suggest the potential influence of confounding factors including acclimatization to the task and fatigue during the protocol. The results suggest that the minimum number of steps previously reported as necessary to accurately assess step width and step width variability of young adults during treadmill walking is not valid for middle-age women. Furthermore, the results point to the potential value of reproducing and/or extending the original experiment that established 400 consecutive steps as necessary to accurately estimate step kinematics among young adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ten healthy older (71.4 ± 1.44 years) and younger adults (26.2 ± 1.63 years) stood atop a moveable platform and received blocks of twelve consecutive EXT and SLF drop perturbations. Following the last SLF trial, participants received an additional EXT trial spaced 20 min apart to assess retention (EXT RTN) of any modulation effects. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded bilaterally over the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and tibialis anterior (TA). Whole-body kinematics and kinetic data were recorded. Stability in the antero-posterior direction was quantified using the margin of stability (MoS). Compared with EXT trials, both groups reduced SCM peak amplitude responses during SLF and EXT RTN trials. VL/BF and TA/MG coactivation were reduced during SLF FTR compared to EXT FTR (p < 0.05) with reduced peak vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) in both younger and older adults (p < 0.05). Older adults increased their MoS during SLF FTR compared to EXT FTR (p < 0.05). Both groups performed more eccentric work during SLF trials compared to EXT (p < 0.05).

Twenty men were tested on two sessions separated by 48 h against external loads of 0.5, 30 and 60 kg. The initiation of the jump was defined as the first instant in which the vertical ground reaction force exceeded system weight by 10 N (10 N), 50 N (50 N), 1% of system weight (1%SW), 10% of system weight (10%SW) and five standard deviation of system weight minus 30 ms (5SDSW). The following variables were calculated from the force-time signal collected on a force platform: mean, peak and time to peak values of force, power and velocity, average rate of force development, peak rate of force development, rate of force development index, impulse, jump height, and push-off time. The 50 N, 10%SW and 5SDSW thresholds generally revealed a higher reliability than the 10 N and 1%SW thresholds (97 and 21 out of 252 comparisons for the coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively). The magnitude of most of the variables calculated using the 50 N and 10%SW thresholds significantly differed with respect to the 10 N, 1%SW and 5SDSW thresholds (P < 0.05).

However, the consistency between models remain unknown and differences in model predicted hip contact forces between studies are difficult to distinguish from natural inter-individual differences. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate differences in hip joint contact forces during gait between four OpenSim models. These models included the generic models gait2392 and the Arnold Lower Limb Model, as well as the hip specific models hip2372 and London Lower Limb Model. Data from four individuals who have had a total hip replacement with instrumented hip implants performing slow, normal, and fast walking trials were taken from the HIP98 database to evaluate the various models effectiveness at estimating hip loads. Muscle forces were estimated using static optimization and hip contact forces were calculated using the JointReaction analysis in OpenSim. Results indicated that, for gait, the hip specific London Lower Limb Model consistently predicted peak push-off hip joint contact forces with lower magnitude and timing errors compared to the other models. Likewise, root mean square error values were lowest and correlation coefficients were highest for the London Lower Limb Model. These results suggest that the London Lower Limb Model is the most appropriate model for investigations focused on hip joint loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study investigated the effect of an active exoskeleton, controlled using three different control modes (INCLINATION, EMG & HYBRID), on spinal compression forces during lifting with various techniques. Ten healthy male subjects lifted a 15 kg box, with three lifting techniques (free, squat & stoop), each of which was performed four times, once without EXO and once each with the three different control modes. Using inverse dynamics, we calculated L5/S1 joint moments. Subsequently, we estimated spine forces using an EMG-assisted trunk model. Peak compression forces substantially decreased by 17.8% when wearing the EXO compared to NO EXO. However, this reduction was partly, by about one third, attributable to a reduction of 25% in peak lifting speed when wearing the EXO. While subtle differences in back load patterns were seen between the three control modes, no differences in peak compression forces were found. In part, this may be related to limitations in the torque generating capacity of the EXO. Therefore, with the current limitations of the motors it was impossible to determine which of the control modes was best. Despite these limitations, the EXO still reduced both peak and cumulative compression forces by about 18%.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We investigated the relationships between clinical and biomechanical walking measures that may contribute to changes in daily stepping activity following physical interventions provided to participants with subacute stroke. Following ≤40 rehabilitation sessions, 39 participants were categorized into three groups: responders/retainers increased daily stepping >500 steps/day post-training (POST) without decreases in stepping at 2-6 month follow-up (F/U); responders/non-retainers increased stepping at POST but declined >500 steps/day at F/U; and, non-responders did not change daily stepping from baseline testing (BSL). Gait kinematics and kinetics were evaluated during graded treadmill assessments at BSL and POST. Clinical measures of gait speed, timed walking distance, balance and balance confidence were measured at BSL, POST and F/U. Between-group comparisons and regression analyses were conducted to predict stepping activity from BSL and POST measurements. Baseline and changes in clinical measures of walking demonstrated selective associations with stepping, although kinematic measures appeared to better discriminate responders. Specific measures suggest greater paretic vs non-paretic kinematic changes in responders with training, although greater non-paretic changes predicted greater gains (i.e., smaller declines) in stepping in retainers at F/U. No kinetic variables were primary predictors of changes in stepping activity at POST or F/U.

This new metric was used to compare a generic model scaled in a standard manner to a more subject-specific model. An experimental protocol for assessing the RWS was performed by ten participants for four distinct hand-payload cases. In addition, isometric individual strength measurements were collected for 12 different directions. The strength of subject-specific musculoskeletal models was then computed using the following assumptions: (1) standard routines including the length-mass-fat (LMF) scaling law; (2) the isometric strengths of the muscle elements were optimized to the individual strength measurements using joint strength factors (JSF). The RWS of each participant was subsequently estimated from each of the scaling approaches, LMF and JSF, for the four load cases. The experimental RWS showed that the volume and shape decreased with increasing hand-payload for every participant. The lateral and frontal far-from-torso aspects of the RWS were reduced the most. These trends were reproduced by both strength scaling approaches, but the LMF-scaled models were not able to track the overall RWS volume decrease with increasing payload, since they proved to be weaker than the participants. On the other hand, the optimised JSF subject-specific models performed better on the prediction of the RWS for all payload cases across participants. The RWS can potentially be further used as a subject-specific musculoskeletal model validation, enabling quantification of the volume and shape differences between experimentally and model-predicted RWSs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Detecting heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events using the trajectory of markers attached to the feet is common in straight-line gait analysis and could reveal very useful to evaluate turning maneuvers. Yet, a comprehensive evaluation is missing, making difficult the selection of features for temporal analysis of turning. This study aimed to compare features of foot marker trajectories to detect HS and TO. Twenty healthy participants, 10 young (5 males, 23 ± 1 years old, 21.3 ± 2.2 kg/m2) and 10 elderly (4 males, 72 ± 5 years old, 26.4 ± 6.4 kg/m2), performed quarter, half, and full turns as well as straight-line walking in a gait lab. Fourteen features, adapted from straight-line walking literature, were used to detect HS and TO based on marker trajectories. Force plate measures served as reference. One HS and one TO feature were found particularly suitable. Overall, they detected more than 99% of the 1788 events recorded, with accuracies and precisions of -3.9 ms and 9.0 ms for HS and -7.8 ms and 10.7 ms for TO, respectively. Differences in accuracy and precision were observed among walking conditions and groups, but remained small, generally below 4.0 ms. In conclusion, this study identified kinematic features that can be used to analyze both turning and straight-line walking.

Limited data currently exists describing the preparatory movement patterns and those that occur during an episode of 'giving way. Therefore, this case report describes the movement patterns and the forces generated during an unintentional 'giving way' captured while an individual with unilateral CAI was performing a single-leg landing task in a research laboratory. The participant completed five single-leg landing trials for both limbs. 3D lower extremity kinematics and kinetics for the sagittal and frontal plane were extracted from 200 ms before and after initial contact (IC). Relative to the affected and un-affected single-leg landing trials, the 'giving way' episode was characterized by an increase in plantarflexion and hip extension moments before and after IC. The plantarflexion deviation dissipated (50 ms post-IC) and was followed by excessive ankle inversion. The ankle began to plantarflex again (150 ms post-IC) and the knee extended (50 ms post-IC) and adducted (100 ms post-IC). As a result, the ankle inversion angle plateaued at 150 ms post-IC. Furthermore, large sagittal plane internal joint moments were observed. In the frontal plane, the 'giving way' trial generated a large inversion joint moment which was counteracted by a large internal eversion joint moment. The observed plantarflexion and knee extension and adduction after initial contact likely contributed to preventing the ankle from continuing to invert and avoid an ankle sprain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The goal is stable embolisation that facilitates stent endothelialisation, and elimination of the aneurysm. However, it is not fully understood why some aneurysms fail to develop a stable clot even with sufficient levels of flow reduction. Computational prediction of thrombus formation dynamics can help predict the post-operative response in such challenging cases. In this work, we propose a new model of thrombus formation and platelet dynamics inside intracranial aneurysms. Our novel contribution combines platelet activation and transport with fibrin generation, which is key to characterising stable and unstable thrombus. The model is based on two types of thrombus inside aneurysms: red thrombus (fibrin- and erythrocyte-rich) can be found in unstable clots, while white thrombus (fibrin- and platelet-rich) can be found in stable clots. The thrombus generation model is coupled to a CFD model and the flow-induced platelet index (FiPi) is defined as a quantitative measure of clot stability. Our model is validated against an in vitro phantom study of two flow-diverting stents with different sizing. We demonstrate that our model accurately predicts the lower thrombus stability in the oversized stent scenario. This opens possibilities for using computational simulations to improve endovascular treatment planning and reduce adverse events, such as delayed haemorrhage of flow-diverted aneurysms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Elbow extension strength appears to be a key determinant of rotator cuff stress during upper limb weight-bearing lifts since individuals with paraplegia who generate greater elbow extensor moments experience lower rotator cuff stress relative to individuals with tetraplegia. Biceps-to-triceps transfer surgery can increase elbow extension strength in individuals with tetraplegia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether active elbow extension via biceps transfer decreases rotator cuff stress during weight-bearing lifts in individuals with tetraplegia. A forward dynamics computational framework was used to estimate muscle stress during the lift; stress was computed as muscle force divided by the peak isometric muscle force. We hypothesized that rotator cuff stresses would be lower in simulated lifting with biceps transfer relative to simulated lifting without biceps transfer. We found that limited elbow extension strength in individuals with tetraplegia, regardless of whether elbow strength is enabled via biceps transfer or is residual after spinal cord injury, results in muscle stresses exceeding 85% of the peak isometric muscle stress in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The rotator cuff stresses we estimated suggest that performance of weight-bearing activities should be minimized or assisted in order to reduce the risk for shoulder pain.

Combining the advantages of both domains is necessary when tissue stress and physical body motion are both of interest. However, the method for this topic is still in exploration. The aim of this study is to implement unique controlling strategies in finite element model for simultaneously simulating musculoskeletal body dynamics and in vivo stress inside human tissues. A finite element lower limb model with 3D active muscles was selected for the implementation of controlling strategies, which was further validated against in-vivo human motion experiments. A unique feedback control strategy that couples together a basic Proportion-Integration-Differentiation (PID) controller and generic active signals from Computed Muscle Control (CMC) method of the musculoskeletal model or normalized EMG singles was proposed and applied in the present model. The results show that the new proposed controlling strategy show a good correlation with experimental test data of the normal gait considering joint kinematics, while stress distribution of local lower limb tissue can be also detected in real-time with lower limb motion. In summary, the present work is the first step for the application of active controlling strategy in the finite element model for concurrent simulation of both body dynamics and tissue stress. In the future, the present method can be further developed to apply it in various fields for human biomechanical analysis to monitor local stress and strain distribution by simultaneously simulating human locomotion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This scheme simplifies the neural control problem associated with the high-dimensional structure of the neuromuscular system. Several lines of evidence have suggested that neurological injuries, such as stroke or cerebral palsy, may reduce the dimensions that are available to the motor control system, and these altered dimensions or synergies are thought to contribute to impaired walking patterns. However, no study has investigated whether impaired low-dimensional control spaces necessarily lead to impaired walking patterns. In this study, using a two-dimensional model of walking, we developed a synergy-based control framework that can simulate the dynamics of walking. The simulation analysis showed that a synergy-based control scheme can produce well-coordinated movements of walking matching unimpaired gait. However, when the dimensions available to the controller were reduced, the simplified emergent pattern deviated from unimpaired gait. A system with two synergies, similar to those seen after neurological injury, could not produce an unimpaired walking pattern. These findings provide further evidence that altered muscle synergies can contribute to impaired gait patterns and may need to be directly addressed to improve gait after neurological injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the T2 relaxation time of tibiotalar cartilage and ankle biomechanics following 5 km barefoot running. Twenty healthy runners (who had no 5 km barefoot running experience) underwent 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) scans and assessment of running gait before and after 5 km barefoot running. Participants were divided into two groups consisting of marathon-experienced (n = 10) and novice (n = 10) with equal number of males and females in each group. Three musculoskeletal radiologists measured T2 relaxation times in 18 regions of the ankle cartilage: anterior zone, central zone, and posterior zone, or lateral, middle, and medial sections in the sagittal plane. Three-dimensional ankle kinetics, kinematics, and plantar pressure were all also assessed during barefoot running. In the novice group, the T2 relaxation time in the posterior zone of tibial cartilage (p = 0.001) and lateral section in both tibial (p = 0.02) and talar (p = 0.02) cartilage were significantly increased after barefoot running. Ankle kinematics exhibited significant changes in females. Plantar loading was shifted from the medial to lateral aspect after running. This included a significant reduction in the loading under the toes and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd metatarsals, with a significant increase under the 4th and 5th metatarsals and lateral midfoot.

Using an integrated force plate, impact forces were assessed from 10 young adults (5 males; 5 females), falling from planted knees onto outstretched arms, from a random order of drop heights: 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm. A single-spring model incorporating body mass, drop height plus the estimated linear stiffness of the upper extremity (hand, wrist and arm) was used to predict impact force on the hand. We used an analysis of variance linearity test to test the validity of using a linear stiffness coefficient in the model. We used linear regression to assess variance (R2) in experimental impact force predicted by the single-spring model. We derived optimum linear stiffness coefficients for male, female and sex-combined. Our results indicated that the association between experimental and predicted impact forces was linear (P < 0.05). Explain variance in experimental impact force was R2 = 0.82 for sex-combined, R2 = 0.88 for males and R2 = 0.84 for females. Optimum stiffness coefficients were 7436 N/m for sex-combined, 8989 N/m for males and 4527 N/m for females. In conclusion, a linear spring coefficient used in the single-spring model proved valid for predicting impact forces from fall heights up to 25 cm. Results also suggest the use of sex-specific spring coefficients when estimating impact force using the single-spring model.

Hence, wave speed could be used to infer tendon load provided that the wave speed-stress relationship can be calibrated and remains robust across loading conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of loading rate and fluid immersion on the wave speed-stress relationship in ex vivo tendons, and to assess potential calibration techniques. Tendon wave speed and axial stress were measured in 20 porcine digital flexor tendons during cyclic (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 Hz) or static axial loading. Squared wave speed was highly correlated to stress (r2avg = 0.98) and was insensitive to loading rate (p = 0.57). The constant of proportionality is the effective density, which reflects the density of the tendon tissue and additional effective mass added by the adjacent fluid. Effective densities of tendons vibrating in a saline bath averaged 1680 kg/m3 and added mass effects caused wave speeds to be 22% lower on average in a saline bath than in air. The root-mean-square error between predicted and measured stress was 0.67 MPa (6.7% of maximum stress) when using tendon-specific calibration parameters. These errors increased to 1.31 MPa (13.1% of maximum stress) when calibrating based on group-compiled data from ten tendons.

To better understand their respective involvement, a protocol was set up for young healthy individuals consisting in standing on a double seesaw, favoring pitch motions and laying on a dual-force platform. The postural control effects induced by two types of asymmetry, weight-bearing and the CP movement patterns, were investigated. These asymmetries were achieved by associating two seesaws with two different lengths for the radii of the ridges and by requiring specific body-weight distributions. The results indicate that the postural strategies, aimed at controlling anteroposterior sway, are related to the subjects' capacity to minimize the CP displacements under the less stable support, whatever load is applied. In contrast, the degree of involvement of the more stable support must be viewed as a complement used to secure the appropriate motor output, i.e., the resultant CP movements. Within this objective, both the applied load and the CP amplitudes under the more stable support are taken into account. These data provide additional insights into the compensatory mechanisms between the interactions between the two feet, which are used to produce the adequate resultant CP movements and therefore upright stance control. The specificity of the double seesaw that can induce asymmetric CP patterns and/or asymmetric body-weight distribution makes it a legitimate contender to be used as a rehabilitation device for patients with neurological and/or traumatic diseases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The Achilles tendon moment arm may be determined geometrically from an axis (or center) of joint rotation and the line of action of the tendon force, but such moment arms may be sensitive to the location of the joint axis. Using motion analysis to track an ultrasound probe overlying the Achilles tendon along with markers on the shank and foot, we measured Achilles tendon moment arm during loaded and unloaded dynamic plantarflexion motions in 15 healthy subjects. Three representations of the axis or center of rotation of the ankle were considered: (1) a functional axis, defined by motions of the foot and shank; (2) a transmalleolar axis; and (3) a transmalleolar midpoint. Moment arms about the functional axis were larger than those found using the transmalleolar axis and transmalleolar midpoint (all p < 0.001). Moment arms computed with the functional axis increased with plantarflexion angle (all p < 0.001), and increased with loading in the most plantarflexed position (p < 0.001) but these patterns were not observed when either using a transmalleolar axis or transmalleolar midpoint.

However, determination of each muscular force remains fairly challenging in vivo; the conventional data available may be inapplicable to patients who experience major oral interventions such as maxillofacial reconstruction, in which the resultant unsymmetrical anatomical structure invokes a more complex stomatognathic functioning system. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) establish an inverse identification procedure by incorporating the sequential Kriging optimization (SKO) algorithm, coupled with the patient-specific finite element analysis (FEA) in silico and occlusal force measurements at different time points over a course of rehabilitation in vivo; and (2) evaluate muscular functionality for a patient with mandibular reconstruction using a fibula free flap (FFF) procedure. The results from this study proved the hypothesis that the proposed method is of certain statistical advantage of utilizing occlusal force measurements, compared to the traditionally adopted optimality criteria approaches that are basically driven by minimizing the energy consumption of muscle systems engaged. Therefore, it is speculated that mastication may not be optimally controlled, in particular for maxillofacially reconstructed patients. For the abnormal muscular system in the patient with orofacial reconstruction, the study shows that in general, the magnitude of muscle forces fluctuates over the 28-month rehabilitation period regardless of the decreasing trend of the maximum muscular capacity. Such finding implies that the reduction of the masticatory muscle activities on the resection side might lead to non-physiological oral biomechanical responses, which can change the muscular activities for stabilizing the reconstructed mandible.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The optimization-based minimal biped model and spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum (SLIP) model are two popular models that can achieve human-like walking patterns. However, ground reaction forces (GRF) from these two models still deviate from experimental data. In this paper, we proposed an actuated dissipative spring-mass model by integrating these two models to realize more human-like GRF patterns. We first explored the function of stiffness, damping, and weights of both energy cost and force cost in the objective function and found that these parameters have distinctly different influences on the optimized gait and GRF profiles. The stiffness and objective weight affect the number and size of peaks in the vertical GRF and stance time. The damping changes the relative size of the peaks but has little influence on stance time. Based on these observations, these parameters were manually tuned at three different speeds to approach experimentally measured vertical GRF and the highest correlation coefficient can reach 0.983. These results indicate that the stiffness, damping, and proper objective functions are all important factors in achieving human-like motion for this simple walking model. These findings can facilitate the understanding of human walking dynamics and may be applied in future biped models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

When studying high-dimensional datasets, traditional dimension reduction methods (e.g. principal components analysis) require ""data flattening"", which may make the ensuing solutions difficult to interpret. The aim of the present study is to present a case study of how a multi-dimensional dimension reduction technique, Parallel Factor 2 (PARAFAC2), provides a clinically interpretable set of solutions to typical biomechanical datasets where different variables are collected during walking and running. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data used for the present analyses came from two publicly available datasets on walking (n = 33) and running (n = 28). For each dataset, a four-dimensional array was constructed as follows: Mode A was time normalized cycle points; mode B was the number of participants multiplied by the number of speed conditions tested; mode C was the number of joint degrees of freedom, and mode D was variable (angle, velocity, moment, power). Five factors for walking and four factors for running were extracted which explained 79.23% and 84.64% of their dataset's variance. The factor which explains the greatest variance was swing-phase sagittal plane knee kinematics (walking), and kinematics and kinetics (running). Qualitatively, all extracted factors increased in magnitude with greater speed in both walking and running. This study is a proof of concept that PARAFAC2 is useful for performing dimension reduction and producing clinically interpretable solutions to guide clinical decision making.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Force plates (FP) were used as the gold standard to determine ICFP and TOFP for each step. Three algorithms for finding IC, ICMilner, ICAlvim, ICAlvim-mod, and one algorithm for finding toe off, TOFellin, were chosen for analysis. Root mean square errors (RMSE) and difference scores with 95% confidence intervals were computed for IC, TO and stance time (ST). ICAlvim RMSE ranged from 0.175 to 0.219 s.

In line with this hypothesis, studies have shown that the ACL is elongated with decreasing knee flexion angle. Furthermore, at low flexion angles the patellar tendon is oriented to increase the anterior shear component of force acting on the tibia. This indicates that knee extension represents a position in which the ACL is taut, and thus may have an increased propensity for injury, particularly in the presence of excessive force acting via the patellar tendon. However, there is very little in vivo data to describe how patellar tendon orientation and ACL elongation interact during flexion. Therefore, this study measured the patellar tendon tibial shaft angle (indicative of the relative magnitude of the shear component of force acting via the patellar tendon) and ACL length in vivo as subjects performed a quasi-static lunge at varying knee flexion angles. Spearman rho rank correlations within each individual revealed that flexion angles were inversely correlated to both ACL length (rho = -0.94 ± 0.07, mean ± standard deviation, p < 0.05) and patellar tendon tibial shaft angle (rho = -0.99 ± 0.01, p < 0.05). These findings indicate that when the knee is extended, the ACL is both elongated and the patellar tendon tibial shaft angle is increased, resulting in a relative increase in anterior shear force on the tibia acting via the patellar tendon. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that landing with the knee in extension is a high risk scenario for ACL injury.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

CVS manifests itself as the progressive narrowing of intracranial arteries. It is usually diagnosed using Doppler ultrasound, which quantifies blood velocity changes in the affected vessels, but has low sensitivity when CVS affects the peripheral vasculature. The aim of this study was to identify alternative biomarkers that could be used to diagnose CVS. We used a 1D modelling approach to describe the properties of pulse waves that propagate through the cardiovascular system, which allowed the effects of different types of vasospasm on waveforms to be characterised at several locations within a simulated cerebral network. A sensitivity analysis empowered by the use of a Gaussian process statistical emulator was used to identify waveform features that may have strong correlations with vasospasm. We showed that the minimum rate of velocity change can be much more effective than blood velocity for stratifying typical manifestations of vasospasm and its progression. The results and methodology of this study have the potential not only to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of vasospasm, but also to be used in the diagnosis of many other cardiovascular diseases where cardiovascular waves can be decoded to provide disease characterisation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We aimed to develop and validate a new method for analyzing 3D forearm rotational motion. We proposed biplane fluoroscopic intensity-based 2D-3D matching, which employs automatic registration processing using the evolutionary optimization strategy. Biplane fluoroscopy was conducted for forearm rotation at 12.5 frames per second along with computed tomography (CT) at one static position. An arm phantom was embedded with eight stainless steel spheres (diameter, 1.5 mm), and forearm rotational motion measurements using the proposed method were compared with those using radiostereometric analysis, which is considered the ground truth. As for the time resolution analysis, we measured radiohumeral joint motion in a patient with posterolateral rotatory instability and compared the 2D-3D matching method with the simulated multiple CT method, which uses CTs at multiple positions and interpolates between the positions. Rotation errors of the radius and ulna between these two methods were 0.31 ± 0.35° and 0.32 ± 0.33°, respectively, translation errors were 0.43 ± 0.35 mm and 0.29 ± 0.25 mm, respectively. Although the 2D-3D method could detect joint dislocation, the multiple CT method could not detect quick motion during joint dislocation. The proposed method enabled high temporal- and spatial-resolution motion analyses with low radiation exposure. Moreover, it enabled the detection of a sudden motion, such as joint dislocation, and may contribute to 3D motion analysis, including joint dislocation, which currently cannot be analyzed using conventional methods.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the range of stretch velocities studied in previous investigations has been limited to slow and moderate velocities. High velocities of muscle stretching are associated with a loss of force and incomplete cross-bridge attachment to actin, thus creating a unique set of eccentric conditions referred to as slippage. The purpose of this study was to extend the relationship between stretch velocity and RFE to high velocities. We hypothesized that slippage at high velocities might affect RFE. We stretched cat soleus muscles for 4 mm to the plateau of the force-length relationship at speeds of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 mm/s to induce RFE, and slippage for the fastest condition. For each RFE test, a corresponding isometric reference test was conducted. Residual force enhancement was quantified as the relative increase in isometric steady state force between the experimental stretch and the isometric reference tests. Residual force enhancement was similar for all stretch speeds, as expected, with the exception of the fastest speed (64 mm/s), which was associated with slippage and no significant RFE. These results suggest that if stretch speeds are too fast, and are associated with slippage, RFE is abolished. We conclude from these findings that proper cross-bridge engagement is required during eccentric muscle action to produce RFE.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Further, walking on uneven surfaces is a common fall risk for these people that hinder with their daily life activities. In addition, a few years after a stroke, lower-limb exercises become less focused, especially the ankle joint movement. The objective of this study is to determine the gait performance of older adults with chronic stroke on an uneven surface in relation to ankle mobility after a four-week bi-axial ankle range of motion (ROM) exercise session. Fifteen older adults with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis (N = 15; mean age = 65 years) participated in a total of 12 bi-axial ankle ROM exercises that consisted of three 30-min training sessions per week for four weeks. Basic clinical tests and gait performance in even and uneven surfaces were evaluated before and after training.

Even though push-rim wheelchairs help to promote a healthy life style, the high muscular demand and the non-continuous push motions can lead to serious upper extremity injuries. In this study, muscle EMG data of ten healthy subjects were recorded for a newly introduced handle based propulsion mechanism (HBP) and compared to conventional push-rim propulsion at two workloads, 25 W and 35 W respectively. The results for the mean peak muscle activations at both workloads demonstrate that push-rim propulsion leads to higher peak muscle activity compared to HBP at a similar wheelchair forward velocity of 1.11 m/s. The generation of these high peak muscle activations with increasing loads in push-rim propulsion over time can lead to overuse injuries.

The hypothesis that diastolic vortices store kinetic energy and assist systolic ejection was tested, by performing systolic simulations in the presence and absence of diastolic vortices. The latter was achieved by reinitializing the entire velocity field to be zero at the beginning of systole. A rudimentary prescribed motion model of a mitral valve was included in the simulations to direct the incoming mitral jet towards the apex. Results showed that the presence or absence of diastolic vortex rings had insignificant impact on the energy expended by walls of the left ventricles for systolic ejection for both the porcine subjects, under all physiological conditions. Although substantial kinetic energy was stored in diastolic vortices by end diastole, it provided no appreciable savings during systolic ejection, and most likely continued to complete dissipation during systole. The role of diastolic vortices in apical washout was investigated by studying the cumulative mass fraction of passive dye that was ejected during systole in the presence and absence of vortices. Results indicated that the diastolic vortices play a crucial role in ensuring efficient washout of apical blood during systolic ejection.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although the leg force actuator has been widely studied, few researches analyze the hip torque actuator during the step-to-step transition. In this paper, we build a powered walking model which consists of a point mass linked with two compliant legs. Each leg has a spring and a damper in parallel. Two types of active actuators, the force actuator on the leg and the torque actuator at the hip, are added to simulate the leg force and hip torque actuator during the step-to-step transition. The cycle walk is solved by numerical simulations under different hip torque strength, and the energetics and stability are evaluated. The simulation results show that the hip torque actuator can reduce the energy cost and improve the stability of walking. Further analysis shows that the hip torque actuator can reduce mechanical works of both legs with small extra energy cost. To understand the principle of hip torque actuator, the CoM dynamics is analyzed. It is shown that the hip torque actuator is efficient on the redirection of CoM. Thus, it can improve the stability and reduce required forces of both legs, which decreases the energy cost. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the hip torque during the step-to-step transition, and may help improve the design of bipedal robots and prosthesis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, little is known about the adaptive changes in micromechanical behavior of cancellous and cortical tissues resulting from loading or disuse. To address this issue, in vivo tibial loading and hindlimb unloading experiments were conducted on 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Changes in bone mass and tissue-level strains in the metaphyseal cancellous and midshaft cortical bone of the tibiae, resulting from loading or unloading, were determined using microCT and finite element (FE) analysis, respectively. We found that loading- and unloading-induced changes in bone mass were more pronounced in the cancellous than cortical bone. Simulated FE-loading showed that a greater proportion of elements experienced relatively lower longitudinal strains following load-induced bone adaptation, while the opposite was true in the disuse model. While the magnitudes of maximum or minimum principal strains in the metaphyseal cancellous and midshaft cortical bone were not affected by loading, strains oriented with the long axis were reduced in the load-adapted tibia suggesting that loading-induced micromechanical benefits were aligned primarily in the loading direction. Regression analyses demonstrated that bone mass was a good predictor of bone tissue strains for the cortical bone but not for the cancellous bone, which has complex microarchitecture and spatially-variant strain environments. In summary, loading-induced micromechanical benefits for cancellous and cortical tissues are received primarily in the direction of force application and cancellous bone mass may not be related to the micromechanics of cancellous bone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A single shoe-embedded sensor module can measure the foot progression angle (FPA) during walking. The FPA has important clinical utility, particularly in populations with knee osteoarthritis, as it is a target for biomechanical treatments. However, the validity and the day-to-day reliability of FPA measurement using wearable systems during over-ground walking has yet to be established. Two gait analysis sessions on 20 healthy adults were conducted. During both sessions, participants performed natural over-ground walking in a motion capture laboratory and on a 100 m linear section of outdoor athletics track. FPA was measured in the laboratory via marker trajectory data, while the sensor module measured FPA during the outdoor track walking. Validity was examined by comparing the laboratory- and sensor-measured average FPA. Day-to-day reliability was examined by comparing the sensor-measured FPA between the first and second gait analysis sessions. Average absolute error between motion capture and sensor measured FPA were 1.7° and 2.1° at session 1 and 2, respectively. A Bland and Altman plot indicated no systematic bias, with 95% limit of agreement widths of 4.2° - 5.1°.

Flow through these pathways is important for solute transport and to prevent fluid accumulation. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with subarachnoid space obstructions such as Chiari I malformation. However, the mechanism of development of these fluid-filled cavities is unclear. Studies have suggested that changes in the arterial and CSF pressures could alter normal perivascular flow. This study uses an idealised model of the perivascular space to investigate how variation in the arterial pulse influences fluid flow. The model used simulated subarachnoid pressures from healthy controls (N = 9), Chiari patients with (N = 7) and without (N = 8) syringomyelia. A parametric analysis was conducted to determine how features of the arterial pulse altered flow. The features of interest included: the timing and magnitude of the peak displacement, and the area under the curve in the phases of uptake and decline. A secondary aim was to determine if the previously observed differences between subject groups were sensitive to variation in the arterial pulse wave. The study demonstrated that the Chiari patients without a syrinx maintained a significantly higher level of perivascular inflow over a physiologically likely range of pulse wave shapes. The analysis also suggested that age-related changes in the arterial pulse (i.e. increased late systolic pulse amplitude and faster diastolic decay), could increase resistance to perivascular inflow affecting solute transport.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These models are constructed by three-dimensionally scanning two national-team ski jumpers taking flight postures. The drag and lift forces on each component of a ski jumper and skis (head with helmet and goggle, body, arms, legs and skis) and their lift-to-drag ratios are obtained. For the two posture models, the drag forces on the body, legs and skis are larger than those on the arms and head with helmet and goggle, but the lift forces on the body and skis are larger than their drag forces, resulting in high lift-to-drag ratios on the body and skis and low lift-to-drag ratio on the legs. We construct simple geometric models, such as the circular cylinder, sphere and thin rectangular plate, predicting the drag and lift forces on each component of a ski jumper and skis, and validate them with those obtained from LES. Using these geometric models, we perform a parametric study on the position angles of flight posture for higher total lift-to-drag ratio. The flight postures obtained increase the total lift-to-drag ratios by 35% and 21% from those of two base postures, respectively. Finally, LESs are performed for the postures obtained and show the increases in the total lift-to-drag ratios by 21% and 16%, respectively, indicating the adequacy of using the simple geometric models for finding a flight posture of ski jumping having a higher lift-to-drag ratio at low cost.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We adapted a previous joint-level approach to develop a muscle-specific index-based approach to characterise the functional behaviours of human lower-limb muscles during movement tasks. Using muscle mechanical power and work outputs derived from experimental data and computational simulations of human walking and running, our index-based approach differentiated known distinct functional behaviours with varying mechanical demands, such as greater spring-like function during running compared with walking; with anatomical location, such as greater motor-like function in proximal compared with the distal lower-limb muscles; and with MTU architecture, such as greater strut-like muscles fibre function compared with the MTU in the ankle plantarflexors. The functional indices developed in this study provide distinct quantitative measures of muscle function in the human lower-limb muscles during dynamic movement tasks, which may be beneficial towards tuning the design and control strategies of physiologically-inspired robotic and assistive devices.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study assesses the ability of a motion capture system (Vicon T40s) arranged externally to track a retro-reflective marker inside a glass tank filled with water and without water. The reflective tape used for marker creation in this study was of Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) grade as the conventional marker loses its reflective properties when submerged. The overall trueness calculated based on the mean marker distance errors, varied between 0.257 mm and 0.290 mm in different mediums (air, glass and water). The overall precision calculated based on mean standard deviation of mean marker distances at different locations varied between 0.046 mm and 0.360 mm in different mediums. Our results suggest, that there is no significant influence of the presence of water on the overall static accuracy of the marker center distances when markers were made of SOLAS grade reflective tape. Using optical motion tracking systems for evaluating locomotion in aquatic environment can help to better understand the effects of aquatic therapy in clinical rehabilitation, especially in scenarios that involve equipment, such as an underwater treadmill which generally have constrained capture volumes for motion capture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Its features are susceptible to cardiovascular pathology and treatment, in particular to surgical interventions involving the valves (mitral valve replacement). To improve our understanding of intraventricular fluid mechanics and the impact of various types of prosthetic valves thereon, we have developed a custom-designed versatile left ventricular phantom with anatomically realistic moving left ventricular membrane. A biological, a tilting disc and a bileaflet valve (in two different orientations) were mounted in the mitral position and tested under the same settings. To investigate 3D flow within the phantom, a four-view tomographic particle image velocimetry setup has been implemented. The results compare side-by-side the evolution of the 3D flow topology, vortical structures and kinetic energy in the left ventricle domain during the cardiac cycle. Except for the tilting disc valve, all tested prosthetic valves induced a crossed flow path, where the outflow crosses the inflow path, passing under the mitral valve. The biological valve shows a strong jet with a peak velocity about twice as high compared to all mechanical heart valves, which makes it easier to penetrate deeply into the cavity. Accordingly, the peak kinetic energy in the left ventricle in case of the biological valve is about four times higher than the mechanical heart valves. We conclude that the tomographic particle imaging velocimetry setup provides a useful ground truth measurement of flow features and allows a comparison of the effects of different valve types on left ventricular flow patterns.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty-five post-TKR patients and ten healthy controls performed five walking trials on level ground and different slopes on an instrumented ramp system. A 2 × 2 × 4 (limb × group × incline slope) mixed model ANOVA was used to examine selected variables. The peak knee extension moment (KEM) was greater in 15° uphill walking compared to level, 5° and 10° uphill walking. TKR patients had lower peak KEM and smaller knee extension range of motion than healthy controls in all walking conditions. The Replaced Limb showed lower peak KEM in 10° and 15° uphill walking than the Non-replaced Limb and smaller knee extension range of motion (ROM) in 10° uphill walking. Knee extension and abduction ROM increased with increased incline angles. The greater peak loading-response vertical ground reaction force was found in level walking compared to three levels of uphill walking. The peak loading-response knee abduction moment was greater in level walking compared to 10° and 15° uphill walking. However, the medial knee contact force was greater in non-replaced limb compared to replaced limb in 10° and 15° uphill walking.

This approach allowed us to express CF as the function of inter-lamellar water channel width (w) and to derive an analytical solution of the width (wmin) at the minimum CF. Morphometric and physiological data for rainbow trout in the literature were referred to calculate CF(w) curves and their wmin values at five intensity stages of swimming exercise. Obtained wmin values were evenly distributed around the standard measure of the width (ws = 24 μm) in this fish. Individual levels of CF(wmin) were also fairly close to the corresponding CF(ws) values within a 10% deviation, suggesting the reliability of approximating [CF(wmin) = CF(ws)]. The cost-performance of O2 uptake through the gill (ηg) was then assessed from reported data of total O2 uptake/CF(ws) at each intensity stage. The ηg levels at any swimming stage exceeded 95% of the theoretical maximum value, implying that O2 uptake is nearly optimally performed in the lamellar-channel system at all swimming speeds. Further analyses of O2 transport in this fresh water fish revealed that the water ventilation by the buccal/opercular pumping evokes a critical limit of swimming velocity, due to confined O2 supply to the peripheral skeletal muscles, which is avoided in ram ventilators such as tuna.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, these test standards have several simplifications to make it practical, robust and cost-effective, such as the head is represented with a hemisphere, only the linear kinematics is evaluated and the body is excluded. Little is known about how these simplifications may influence the test results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of these simplifications on global head kinematics and head injury prediction for different age groups. The finite element human body model PIPER was used and scaled to seven different age groups from 1.5 up to 18 years old, and each model was impacted at three different playground surface stiffness and three head impact locations. All simulations were performed in pairs, including and excluding the body. Linear kinematics and skull bone stress showed small influence if excluding the body while head angular kinematics and brain tissue strain were underestimated by the same simplification. The predicted performance of the three different playground surface materials, in terms of head angular kinematics and brain tissue strain, was also altered when including the body. A body and biofidelic neck need to be included, together with suitable head angular kinematics based injury thresholds, in future physical or virtual playground surface test standards to better prevent brain injuries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, variations in micromechanics among arterial layers (i.e. intima, media, adventitia), as well as dependency on local matrix composition and/or structure, anatomical location or developmental stage remain largely unknown. This study determined layer-specific stiffness in elastic arteries, including the main pulmonary artery, ascending aorta, and carotid artery using atomic force indentation. To compare stiffness with age and frozen processing techniques, neonatal and adult pulmonary arteries were tested, while fresh (vibratomed) and frozen (cryotomed) tissues were tested from the adult aorta. Results revealed that the mean compressive modulus varied among the intima, sub-luminal media, inner-middle media, and adventitia layers in the range of 1-10 kPa for adult arteries. Adult samples, when compared to neonatal pulmonary arteries, exhibited increased stiffness in all layers except adventitia. Compared to freshly isolated samples, frozen preparation yielded small stiffness increases in each layer to varied degrees, thus inaccurately representing physiological stiffness. To interpret micromechanics measurements, composition and structure analyses of structural matrix proteins were conducted with histology and multiphoton imaging modalities including second harmonic generation and two-photon fluorescence. Composition analysis of matrix protein area density demonstrated that decrease in the elastin-to-collagen and/or glycosaminoglycan-to-collagen ratios corresponded to stiffness increases in identical layers among different types of arteries. However, composition analysis was insufficient to interpret stiffness variations between layers which had dissimilar microstructure.

However, forefoot strike may overload the plantar fascia and alter the plantar fascia elasticity. This study aimed to use ultrasound elastography to investigate and compare shear wave elasticity of the plantar fascia between rearfoot strikers and forefoot strikers. A total of 35 participants (21 rearfoot strikers and 14 forefoot strikers), who were free of lower limb injuries and diseases, were recruited from a local running club. Individual foot strike patterns were identified through the measured plantar pressure during treadmill running. The B-Mode ultrasound images and shear wave elastographic images of the plantar fascia were collected from each runner. Two independent investigators reviewed the images and examined the plantar fascia qualitatively and quantitatively. The results demonstrated an overall good agreement between the investigators in the image review outcomes (ICC:0.96-0.98, κ: 0.89). There were no significant differences in the fascial thickness (p = 0.50) and hypoechogenicity on the gray-scale images (p = 0.54) between the two groups. Shear wave elastography showed that forefoot strikers exhibited reduced plantar fascia elasticity compared to rearfoot strikers (p = 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.91). A less elastic fascial tissue was more easily strained under loading. Tissue overstrain is frequently related to the incidence of plantar fasciitis.

However, the optimal intensity of hollowing is still unclear. The objective of the present study is to verify the validity of estimating the tension of the TrA by measuring the girth of the abdomen with a tape and to determine the optimum intensity of hollowing to effectively train the TrA. Sixteen healthy males performed hollowing with an intensity of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, estimated from the girth of the abdomen. The shear elastic modulus was measured for the rectus abdominis (RA), external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and TrA at all intensities via ultrasonic shear wave elastography. The shear elastic modulus was considered as the index of the tension of the abdominal muscles at each intensity, and the ratio of the TrA to RA, EO, and IO respectively was calculated as the index of TrA selectivity. As the intensity of hollowing increased, the girth of abdomen decreased and tension of all the four muscles increased. The ratio of TrA to the RA, EO, and IO did not exhibit a significant variation among hollowing intensities of 25% to 100%. It is rational to estimate the tension of the TrA by measuring the girth of the abdomen.

Discrete element analysis (DEA) is a computationally efficient method to estimate cartilage contact stresses with potential application at the PFJ to better understand PFJ mechanics. The current study validated a DEA modeling framework driven by PFJ kinematics to predict experimentally-measured PFJ contact stress distributions. Two cadaveric knee specimens underwent quadriceps muscle [215 N] and joint compression [350 N] forces at ten discrete knee positions representing PFJ positions during early gait while measured PFJ kinematics were used to drive specimen-specific DEA models. DEA-computed contact stress and area were compared to experimentally-measured data. There was good agreement between computed and measured mean and peak stress across the specimens and positions (r = 0.63-0.85). DEA-computed mean stress was within an average of 12% (range: 1-47%) of the experimentally-measured mean stress while DEA-computed peak stress was within an average of 22% (range: 1-40%). Stress magnitudes were within the ranges measured (0.17-1.26 MPa computationally vs 0.12-1.13 MPa experimentally). DEA-computed areas overestimated measured areas (average error = 60%; range: 4-117%) with magnitudes ranging from 139 to 307 mm2 computationally vs 74-194 mm2 experimentally.

It remains challenging to both model the musculoskeletal system and then fit the modelled muscles to a specific human subject. We present a reduced muscle model, a planar musculoskeletal model, and a fitting method that can be used to find a feasible set of active and passive muscle parameters for a specific subject. At a minimum, the fitting method requires inverse dynamics data of the subject, a scalar estimate of the peak activation reached during the movement, and a plausible initial estimate for the strength and flexibility of that subject. While additional data can be used to result in a more accurate fit, this data is not required for the method solve for a feasible fit. The minimal input requirements of the proposed fitting method make it well suited for subjects who cannot undergo a maximum voluntary contraction trial, or for whom recording electromyographic data is not possible.

One of the primary biochemical changes associated with disc degeneration is the loss of proteoglycans, which leads to tissue dehydration. While previous studies have reported the effects of in vivo degeneration on annulus fibrosus (AF) failure mechanics, the independent role of water remains unclear, as does the tissue's rate-dependent failure response. Our first objective was to determine the effect of loading rate on AF failure properties in tension; our second objective was to quantify the effect of water content on failure properties. Water content was altered through enzymatic digestion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and through osmotic loading. Bovine AF specimens were tested monotonically to failure along the circumferential direction at 0.00697%/s or 6.97%/s. Increased loading rate resulted in a ∼50% increase in linear-region modulus, failure stress, and strain energy density across all treatment groups (p < 0.001). Decreased GAG and water contents resulted in decreased modulus, failure stress, and strain energy density; however, these differences were only observed at the low loading rate (p < 0.05; no changes at high rate). Osmotic loading was used to evaluate the effect of hydration independently from GAG composition, resulting in similar decreases in water content, modulus, and strain energy density. This suggests that hydration is essential for maintaining tissue stiffness and energy absorption capacity, rather than strength, and that GAGs contribute to tissue strength independently from mediating water content.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To compare the activity and fatigue of upper extremity muscles, pain levels, subject satisfaction levels, perceived exertion, and number of repetitions in Task-Specific Training (TST) compared with Robot-Assisted Training (RAT) in individuals post-stroke.


METHODS
Twenty sub-acute post stroke subjects (16 men; median (interquartile range) age 64.0 (71.5-57.0) years) received two 30-min treatment sessions, one TST and one RAT. Before each session, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was administered. Activity levels and fatigue of six muscles were monitored using surface electromyography and the number of repetitions was counted. After each session, the subjective assessment questionnaire of treatment, the Borg scale and VAS were administered.


RESULTS
During TST, the Anterior Deltoid, Upper Trapezius and Biceps were more active, while during the RAT, the Triceps was more active. The Triceps activity increased during TST towards the end of the session. The pain levels increased after TST and the number of repetitions was higher compared to RAT. There were no significant differences in muscle fatigue, perceived physical exertion and subject satisfaction levels between both treatment sessions.


CONCLUSION
This is the first study to explore the biomechanics of both treatment methods and might therefore shed light on the mechanisms behind their positive outcomes. Due to the differences in the biomechanics of the treatments, a combination of both treatments may be beneficial to the activation of different muscle groups, thereby contributing to the rehabilitation program post stroke.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While locomotor training often improves walking speed, its influence on dynamic balance is unclear. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of a locomotor training program on dynamic balance in individuals post-stroke during steady-state walking and determine if improvements in walking speed are associated with improved balance control. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected pre- and post-training from seventeen participants who completed a 12-week locomotor training program. Dynamic balance was quantified biomechanically (peak-to-peak range of frontal plane whole-body angular-momentum) and clinically (Berg-Balance-Scale and Dynamic-Gait-Index). To understand the underlying biomechanical mechanisms associated with changes in angular-momentum, foot placement and ground-reaction-forces were quantified. As a group, biomechanical assessments of dynamic balance did not reveal any improvements after locomotor training. However, improved dynamic balance post-training, observed in a sub-group of 10 participants (i.e., Responders), was associated with a narrowed paretic foot placement and higher paretic leg vertical ground-reaction-force impulse during late stance. Dynamic balance was not improved post-training in the remaining seven participants (i.e., Non-responders), who did not alter their foot placement and had an increased reliance on their nonparetic leg during weight-bearing. As a group, increased walking speed was not correlated with improved dynamic balance. However, a higher pre-training walking speed was associated with higher gains in dynamic balance post-training. These findings highlight the importance of the paretic leg weight bearing and mediolateral foot placement in improving frontal plane dynamic balance post-stroke.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to validate a low-cost wearable sensor that accurately measured peak knee extension during clinical exercises and needed no additional equipment for calibration. Sagittal plane knee motion was quantified using a 9-axis motion sensor and directly compared to motion capture data. The motion sensor measured the field strength of a strong earth magnet secured to the distal femur, which was correlated with knee angle during a simple calibration process. Peak knee motions and kinematic patterns were compared with motion capture data using paired t-tests and cross correlation, respectively. Peak extension values during seated knee extensions were accurate within 5 degrees across all subjects (root mean square error: 2.6 degrees, P = 0.29). Knee flexion during gait strongly correlated (0.84 ≤ rxy ≤ 0.99) with motion capture measurements but demonstrated peak flexion errors of 10 degrees. In this study, we present a low-cost sensor (≈$ 35 US) that accurately determines knee extension angle following a calibration procedure that did not require any other equipment.

Altered functional demands can also shift the passive force-length relationship. The extent that passive mechanical properties differ within a muscle group (e.g. spine extensors) or between homologous muscles of different species is unknown. It was hypothesized that multifidus, believed to specialize in spine stabilization, would generate greater passive tensile stresses under isometric conditions than erector spinae, which have more generalized functions of moving and stabilizing the spine; observing greater multifidus moduli in different species would strengthen this hypothesis. Permeabilized fibre bundles (n = 337) from the multifidus and erector spinae of mice, rats, and rabbits were mechanically tested. A novel logistic function was fit to the experimental data to fully characterize passive stress and modulus. Species had the greatest effect on passive muscle parameters with mice having the largest moduli at all lengths. Rats generated less passive stress than rabbits due to a shift of the passive force-length relationship towards longer muscle lengths. Rat multifidus generated slightly greater stresses than erector spinae, but no differences were observed between mouse muscles. The secondary objective was to determine the parameters required to simulate the passive force-length relationship. Experimental data were compared to the passive muscle model in OpenSim. The default OpenSim model, optimized for hindlimb muscles, did not fit any of the spine muscles tested; however, the model could accurately simulate experimental data after adjusting the input parameters. The optimal parameters for modelling the passive force-length relationships of spine muscles in OpenSim are presented.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the underlying damage to tissue architecture is difficult to quantify histologically, and published data on macroscopic changes in biophysical properties are sparse. To better understand the influence of hepatic cells and stroma on global biophysical parameters, we studied rat liver specimens freshly taken (within 30 min after death) and treated by freeze-thaw cycles overnight at either -20 °C or -80 °C using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) performed at 0.5 T in a tabletop MRE scanner. Tissue structure was analyzed histologically and rheologic data were analyzed using fractional order derivatives conceptualized by a called spring-pot component that interpolates between pure elastic and viscous responses. Overnight freezing and thawing induced membrane disruptions and cell detachment in the space of Disse, resulting in a markedly lower shear modulus μ and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (μ[-20 °C] = 1.23 ± 0.73 kPa, μ[-80 °C] = 0.66 ± 0.75 kPa; ADC[-20 °C] = 0.649 ± 0.028 μm2/s, ADC[-80 °C] = 0.626 ± 0.025 μm2/s) compared to normal tissue (μ = 9.92 ± 3.30 kPa, ADC = 0.770 ± 0.023 μm2/s, all p < 0.001). Furthermore, we analyzed the springpot-powerlaw coefficient and observed a reduction in -20 °C specimens (0.22 ± 0.14) compared to native tissue (0.40 ± 0.10, p = 0.033) and -80 °C specimens (0.54 ± 0.22, p = 0.002), that correlated with histological observations of sinusoidal dilation and collagen distortion within the space of Disse. Overall, the results suggest that shear modulus and water diffusion in liver tissue markedly decrease due to cell membrane degradation and cell detachment while viscosity-related properties appear to be more sensitive to distorted stromal and microvascular architecture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The in vivo kinematics of the ovine stifle joint were assessed during 'normal' gait, and at 20 and 40 weeks after p-ACL transection (Tx). Gross morphological scoring of the knee was conducted. p-ACL Tx creates significant progressive post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA)-like damage by 40 weeks. Statistically significant increases for flexion angles at hoof-strike (HS) and mid-stance (MST) were seen at 20 weeks post p-ACL Tx and the HS and hoof-off (HO) points at 40 weeks post p-ACL-Tx, therefore increased flexion angles occurred during stance phase. Statistically significant increases in posterior tibial shift at the mid-flexion (MF) and mid-extension (ME) points were seen during the swing phase of the gait cycle at 40 weeks post p-ACL Tx. Correlation analysis showed a strong and significant correlation between kinematic changes (instabilities) and gross morphological score in the inferior-superior direction at 40 weeks post p-ACL Tx at MST, HO, and MF. Further, there was a significant correlation between change in gross morphological combined score (ΔGCS) and the change in location of the helical axis in the anterior direction (ΔsAP) after p-ACL Tx for all points analyzed through the gait cycle. This study quantified in vivo joint kinematics before and after p-ACL Tx knee injury during gait, and demonstrated that a p-ACL knee injury leads to both PTOA-like damage and kinematic changes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

RT calculation methods are classified into Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches where several measures have been proposed to quantify RT. Each of these methods has a different definition of RT, and it is not clear how they are related. In this study, image-based computational models of blood flow in an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a cerebral aneurysm were considered and RT was calculated using different methods. In the Lagrangian methods, discrete particle tracking of massless tracers was used to calculate particle residence time and mean exposure time. In the Eulerian methods, continuum transport models were used to quantify RT using Eulerian RT and virtual ink approaches. Point-wise RT and Eulerian indicator RT were also computed based on measures derived from velocity. A comparison of these methods is presented and the implications of each method are discussed. Our results highlight that most RT methods have a conceptually distinct definition of RT and therefore should be utilized depending on the specific application of interest.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Tendinopathy, in weight and non-weight bearing tendons, in individuals with overweight or obesity has been linked to metabolic dysfunction resulting from obesity. Exercise and dietary fibre supplementation (DFS) are common countermeasures to combat obesity and therefore it seems reasonable to assume that they might protect tendons from structural and mechanical damage in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a DIO, DIO combined with moderate exercise, DIO combined with DFS (prebiotic oligofructose), and DIO combined with moderate exercise and DFS on the mechanical and biochemical properties of the rat tail tendon. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats, fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet were randomized into a sedentary, a moderate exercise, a DFS, or a moderate exercise combined with DFS group for 12 weeks. Additionally, six lean age-matched animals were included as a sedentary control group. DIO in combination with exercise alone and with exercise and DFS reduced the Young's Modulus but not the collagen content of the rat tail tendons compared to lean control animals. However, no differences in the mechanical and biochemical properties of the rat tail tendon were detected between the DIO and the lean control group, suggesting that DIO by itself did not impact the tail tendon.

We examined the motility and flagellar waveform of bovine sperm swimming in a fluid with similar rheological properties as mammalian cervical mucus. The results indicated that the surrounding rheological properties largely affected the flagellar waveform of mammalian spermatozoa; in particular, shear-thinning viscoelastic fluid increased the progressive motility of the sperm. To investigate the influence of flagellar waveform on sperm motility in more detail, the waveform was expressed as a function and the progressive thrust of the sperm was calculated based on the empirical resistive force theory. The results of this study showed that the progressive thrust increased with the curvature of the flagellar tip. Moreover, we calculated the thrust efficiency of motile sperm. Results showed that the thrust efficiency in shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids was larger than that in Newtonian fluids, regardless of viscosity. This suggests that motile sperm in cervical mucus move efficiently by means of a motion mechanism that is suited to their surrounding environment.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Inconclusive evidence exists regarding treatment strategies for both complete tears and partial tears. Well-characterized animal models of tendon injury are important for understanding physiological processes of tendon repair and testing potential therapeutics. Utilizing three distinct models of rat Achilles tendon injury, the objective of this study was to define and compare the effects and relative impact on tendon properties and ankle function of both tear severity (complete tear versus partial tear, both with post-operative immobilization) and immobilization after partial tear (partial tear with versus without immobilization). We hypothesized that a complete tear would cause inferior post-injury properties compared to a partial tear, and that immediate loading after partial tear would improve post-injury properties compared to immobilization. All models were reproducible and had distinct effects on measured parameters. Injury severity drastically influenced tendon healing, with complete tear causing decreased ankle mobility and tendon mechanics compared to partial tears. One week of plantarflexion immobilization had a strong effect on animals receiving a partial tear. Tendons with partial tears and immobilization failed early during fatigue cycling three weeks post-injury. Partial tear without immobilization had no effect on ankle range of motion through dorsiflexion at any time point compared to the pre-surgery value, while partial tear with immobilization demonstrated diminished function at all post-injury time points. All three models of Achilles injury could be useful for tendon healing investigations, chosen based on the prospective applications of a potential therapeutic.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the evolution of mineral density in the extant and new bone after nucleotomy and fixation techniques has to date not been investigated in detail. The main goal of this study is to determine possible mechanisms that may trigger the bone remodelling and formation processes. With that purpose, a finite element model of the L4-L5 spinal segment was used. Bone mineral density (BMD), new tissue composition, and endplate deflection were determined as indicators of lumbar fusion. A bone-remodelling algorithm and a tissue-healing algorithm, both mechanically driven, were implemented to predict vertebral bone alterations and fusion patterns after nucleotomy, internal fixation, and anterior plate placement. When considering an intact disc height, neither nucleotomy nor internal fixation were able to provide the necessary stability to promote bony fusion. However, when 75% of the disc height was considered, bone fusion was predicted for both techniques. By contrast, an anterior plate allowed bone fusion at all disc heights. A 50% disc-height reduction led to osteophyte formation in all cases. Changes in the intervertebral disc tissue caused BMD alterations in the endplates. From this observations it can be drawn that fusion may be self-induced by controlling the mechanical stabilisation without the need of additional fixation. The amount of tissue to be removed to achieve this stabilisation remains to be determined.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The current gold standard for preclinical wear testing of TKRs is mechanical knee simulators. The definition of the femoral center of flexion-extension rotation (CoR) has been identified as one possible source of variability within TKR wear tests, since the femoral curvature varies from distal to posterior. The magnitude of the influence on wear due to changes in location of femoral CoR has not been investigated in depth. During this study, a computational framework utilizing finite element analysis for modelling wear of TKRs was developed and used to investigate the influence of the location of femoral CoR on TKR polyethylene wear during standardized displacement controlled testing (ISO 14243-3:2014). The study was carried out using a 40-point Latin Hypercube Design of Experiments approach. Volumetric wear was highly correlated to femoral CoR in both the superior/inferior and anterior/posterior directions, with a stronger relationship in the superior/inferior direction. In addition, wear scars showing linear penetration were examined, with large differences in simulations at the extreme ends of the sampling region. In this study, it was found that variations in the location of the femoral center of rotation can represent a large source of variability in the preclinical testing and evaluation of the wear performance of total knee replacements. This study represents the first attempt at quantifying the effect on wear of different femoral center of rotations across a large sampling space.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Flight technique optimization for maximizing jump length is a highly complex motor-control task that also depends on the wind. Pontryagin's minimum principle was used in this study to gain a better understanding on how wind influences flight technique optimization. Optimum time courses of the angle of attack α of the skis and of the body-to-ski angle β were computed for seven realistic wind scenarios on the large hill and on the flying hill. The optimum values of α were smaller at headwind, and larger at tailwind when compared to the optimum time course at calm wind. The optimum values of β were the smallest possible ones at the given flight technique constraints, except for the last part of the flight. Optimum adjustments of α increased the jump lengths between 0 and 1.8 m on the large hill, and between 0 and 6.4 m on the flying hill. Maximum jump length increases were achieved at the highest headwind speed. Even larger jump length effects can be achieved by using smaller β-angles, which might be possible in headwind conditions, but this is associated with increased problems to keep the flight stable.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Non-optimal design or alignment choices may result in undesirable contact mechanics and joint kinematics, including poor joint alignment, instability, and reduced range of motion. Implant design and surgical alignment are modifiable factors with potential to improve patient outcomes, and there is a need for robust implant designs that can accommodate patient variability. Our objective was to develop a statistical shape-function model (SFM) of a posterior stabilized implanted knee to instantaneously predict joint mechanics in an efficient manner. Finite element methods were combined with Latin hypercube sampling and regression analyses to produce modeling equations relating nine implant design and six surgical alignment parameters to tibiofemoral (TF) joint mechanics outcomes during a deep knee bend. A SFM was developed and TF contact mechanics, kinematics, and soft tissue loads were instantaneously predicted from the model. Average normalized root-mean-square error predictions were between 2.79% and 9.42%, depending on the number of parameters included in the model. The statistical shape-function model generated instantaneous joint mechanics predictions using a maximum of 130 training simulations, making it ideally suited for integration into a patient-specific design and alignment optimization pipeline.

For each measure, we compared each Kinect version and Qualisys by obtaining the mean true error and mean absolute error, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and optical-to-depth ratio. Although both Kinect v1 and v2 and/or WT and WA data present similar accuracy for some measures, better results were achieved, overall, when using WT data provided by the Kinect v2, especially for velocity measures. Moreover, the velocity and distance presented better results than angle measures. Our results show that both Kinect versions can be an alternative to more expensive systems such as Qualisys, for obtaining distance and velocity measures as well as some angles metrics (namely the knee angles).

A multi-segment model of a standing human was used to investigate the device's performance for balance recovery. According to the simulations, balance recovery in any direction was successfully accomplished with the appropriate initial angle. The relationship between the effective initial angle and detected inclined angle was subsequently established. The stability provided by activation of the device was able to limit the unstable user's sway boundary. The designed device shows promise for use as a balance assistance device for the elderly.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Three-dimensional analysis of kinetic and kinematic outcomes has become one of the most powerful tools in evaluating abnormalities in gait initiation for persons with PD. Surprisingly however, the psychometric properties of spatial and temporal measures of gait initiation for persons with PD have not been established using force-platforms. The purposes of this study were to determine the reliability of kinetic and kinematic measures of gait initiation and to identify the minimal detectable change of these measures in persons with PD during On and Off medication conditions. Sixteen participants with idiopathic PD performed a series of 3 repeated trials of gait initiation by starting from a quiet stance position on 2 AMTI OR-6 force platforms, and walking forward across the floor following a signal from the investigators. Testing was performed first in the Off medication condition, after which participants took their medication and waited 60 min before repeating the gait initiation assessments. Relative test-retest reliability was good-to-excellent for most outcome measures (range 0.417-0.960). Bland-Altman analysis revealed no systematic variance in the majority of outcome measures when tested in distinct medication conditions (On vs. Off medication). Most outcome measures required low-to-moderate amounts of change (<50%) to indicate true change in individual participants. These results suggest that spatial and temporal measures of gait initiation using force-platforms are highly reliable and responsive to changes in performance for persons with PD, regardless of whether individuals are optimally medicated.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Lessons learned from the Big Experiment and National Biomechanics Day.,"Public engagement is an important role for the university academic, but is often neglected due to perceived lack of time and prioritized commitments in research and teaching. Yet, public engagement events offer an untapped opportunity for researchers to collect data from members of the general public who arrive on site at university labs. These engagement events could allow for data collection as part of didactic and demonstrative outreach events to be used in research and science. In this proof of concept study, a collaborative group of international researchers investigated the feasibility of embedding research quality assessment into events surrounding National Biomechanics Day. The Big Experiment collected data on 501 secondary school students (age range: 13 to 18 years) across 9 university sites within a 24-hour period. Data included maximal vertical jump height and self-reported physical activity levels. Vertical jump height was positively correlated to participant height, but not age or body mass. Very physically active students had significantly higher vertical jump heights than individuals who reported being somewhat or not physically active. This feasibility project demonstrates that with substantial preparation and a simple research design, focused research questions can be incorporated into educational outreach initiatives and ultimately provide a rich data source.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While current skin-markers based models of the MLA angle used in stereophotogrammetry allow to estimate foot arch shape and deformation, these do not always appear consistent with foot anatomy and with standard clinical definitions. The aim of this study was to propose novel skin-markers based measures of MLA angle and investigate their reliability during common motor tasks. Markers on the calcaneus, navicular tuberosity, first metatarsal head and base, and on the two malleoli were exploited to test eight definitions of MLA angle consistent with foot anatomy, both as angles between two 3-dimensional vectors and as corresponding projections on the sagittal plane of the foot. The inter-trial, inter-session and inter-examiner reliability of each definition was assessed in multiple walking and running trials of two volunteers, tested by four examiners in three sessions. Inter-trial variability in walking was in the range 0.7-1.2 deg, the inter-session 2.8-7.5 deg, and the inter-examiner in the range 3.7-9.3 deg across all MLA definitions. The Rizzoli Foot Model definition showed the lowest inter-session and inter-examiner variability. MLA measures presented similar variability in walking and running. This study provides preliminary information on the reliability of MLA measurements based on skin-markers. According to the present study, angles between 3-dimensional vectors and minimal marker sets should be preferred over sagittal-plane projections. Further studies should be sought to investigate which definition is more accurate with respect to the real MLA deformation in different loading conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Transport of charged antibiotics into a human lumbar disc was analyzed using a 3D finite element model. The valence (z) of the electrical charge of antibiotics varied from z = +2 (positively charged) to z = -2 (negatively charged). An uncharged antibiotic (z = 0) was used as a control. Cases with transient antibiotic concentration at disc boundaries [to mimic intravenous (IV) infusion] were simulated. Our results showed that diurnal compression increased the concentrations in the nucleus pulposus (NP) region, but degreased the concentrations in the annulus fibrosus (AF) region for all charged or non-charged drugs. The overall concentration (averaged over disc) increased with diurnal compression. The diurnal compression had more effects on negatively charged antibiotics than positively charged ones. For example, at day 5 with diurnal compression, the diurnal compression increased the concentration of negatively charged drug (z = -1) in NP by 18.3%, but only by 6.6% for positively charged one (z = +1). In AF, diurnal compression decreased the concentration by 13.2% for negatively charged drug (z = -1) versus 1.2% for positively charged one (z = +1). Note these percentages are the averaged values over day 5.

A common strategy to facilitate learning of challenging tasks is to use sequential progression - i.e., initially reduce task difficulty and slowly increase task difficulty until the desired difficulty level is reached. However, the evidence related to the use of such sequential progressions to improve learning is mixed for functional skill learning tasks, especially considering situations where practice duration is limited. Here, we studied the benefits of sequential progression using a functional motor learning task that has been previously used in gait rehabilitation. Three groups of participants (N = 43) learned a novel motor task during treadmill walking using different learning strategies. Participants in the specific group (n = 21) practiced only the criterion task (i.e., matching a target template that was scaled-up by 30%) throughout the training. Participants in the sequential group (n = 11) gradually progressed to the criterion task (from 3% to 30% in increments of 3%), whereas participants in the random group (n = 11) started at 3% and progressed in random increments (involving both increases and decreases in task difficulty) to the criterion task. At the end of training, kinematic tracking performance on the criterion task was evaluated in all participants both with and without visual feedback. Results indicated that the tracking error was significantly lower in the specific group, and no differences were observed between the sequential and the random progression groups. The findings indicate that the amount of practice in the criterion task is more critical than the difficulty and variations of task practice when learning new gait patterns during treadmill walking.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The comparison was performed using a motion capture system and simultaneous measurements of COP and vGRF from FP and insoles. At lower insole-vGRF (<250 N/insole) COP accuracy deteriorated and those data were excluded from further analysis. The insoles systematically displaced the COP slightly posteriorly and medially compared to the FP measurements. Pearson's coefficient of correlation (r) between insole- and FP-COP showed good agreement in both the anteroposterior (squat: r = 0.96, leg press: r = 0.97) and mediolateral direction (squat: r = 0.84, leg press: r = 0.90), whereas the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were lower in the mediolateral (squat: 3.9 mm, leg press: 4.5 mm) than the anteroposterior (squat and leg press: 11.8 mm) direction. Vertical GRF was slightly overestimated by the insoles in leg press and RMSE were greater in leg press (8% of peak force) than in squat (6%). Overall, results were within the range of previous studies performed on gait.

However, the traditional in vitro testing methods rarely include compressive loads, especially in investigations of multi-segment cervical spine constructs. Previously, a systematic comparison was performed between the standard pure moment with no compressive loading and published compressive loading techniques (follower load - FL, axial load - AL, and combined load - CL). The systematic comparison was structured a priori using a statistical design of experiments and the desirability function approach, which was chosen based on the goal of determining the optimal compressive loading parameters necessary to mimic the segmental contribution patterns exhibited in vivo. The optimized set of compressive loading parameters resulted in in vitro segmental rotations that were within one standard deviation and 10% of average percent error of the in vivo mean throughout the entire motion path. As hypothesized, the values for the optimized independent variables of FL and AL varied dynamically throughout the motion path. FL was not necessary at the extremes of the flexion-extension (FE) motion path but peaked through the neutral position, whereas, a large negative value of AL was necessary in extension and increased linearly to a large positive value in flexion. Although further validation is required, the long-term goal is to develop a ""physiologic"" in vitro testing method, which will be valuable for evaluating adjacent segment effect following spinal fusion surgery, disc arthroplasty instrumentation testing and design, as well as mechanobiology experiments where correct kinematics and arthrokinematics are critical.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

On the one hand, large positive variations of the Poisson's ratio have been reported, indicating volume reduction under tensile states. On the other hand, negative values were also observed, pointing out an auxetic material response. Based on these experimental observations, the following question is raised: Are these large and discrepant transverse deformations intrinsically related to the constitutive response of tendons or they result from artifacts of the mechanical test setup? In order to provide further insights to this question, an experimental and numerical study on the transverse kinematics of tendons was carried out. Tensile experiments were performed in branches of deep digital flexor tendons of domestic porcine, where the transverse displacements were measured by two high-speed, high-accuracy optical digital micrometers placed transversely to one another. Aiming at a better understanding of the effects of the mechanical test setup in the transverse measurements, a three-dimensional finite element model is proposed to resemble the tensile experiment. The main achieved results strongly support the following hypotheses regarding tensile tests of tendons: the clamping region considerably affects the kinematics of the specimen even at a large distance from the clamps; the transverse deformations are mainly ruled by stiff fibers embedded in a soft matrix; the generalization of the Poisson's ratio to draw conclusions about changes in volume of tendons may lead to misinterpretations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The infestation of vascular calcification in the plaques creates a mechanically complex tissue composite. Local stress concentrations and plaque tissue strength properties are the governing parameters required to predict plaque ruptures. Advanced imaging techniques have permitted insight into fundamental mechanisms driving the initiating inflammatory-driven vascular calcification of the diseased intima at the (sub-) micron scale and up to the macroscale. Clinical studies have potentiated the biomechanical relevance of calcification through the derivation of links between local plaque rupture and specific macrocalcification geometrical features. The clinical implications of the data presented in this review indicate that the combination of imaging, experimental testing, and computational modelling efforts are crucial to predict the rupture risk for atherosclerotic plaques. Specialised experimental tests and modelling efforts have further enhanced the knowledge base for calcified plaque tissue mechanical properties. However, capturing the temporal instability and rupture causality in the plaque fibrous caps remains elusive.

We aimed to determine whether biomechanical alterations in knee OA patients during level walking is increased upper trunk lean in the frontal and sagittal planes, and subsequent alteration in external hip adduction moment (EHAM) and external hip flexion moment (EHFM). A literature search was conducted in PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL through May 2018. Where possible, data were combined into a meta-analysis; pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) of between knee OA patients and healthy adults were calculated using a random-effect model. In total, 32 articles (2037 participants, mean age, 63.0 years) met inclusion criteria. Individuals with knee OA had significantly increased lateral trunk lean toward the ipsilateral limb (pooled SMD: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.77) along with significantly decreased EHAM. These subjects also displayed a non-significantly increased trunk/pelvic flexion angle and EHFM. The GRADE approach judged all measures as ""very low."" These results may indicate that biomechanical alterations accompanying knee OA are associated with increased lateral trunk lean and ensuing alterations in EHAM. Biomechanical alterations in the sagittal plane were not evident. Biomechanical adaptations might have negative sequelae, such as secondary hip abductor muscle weakness and low back pain. Thus, investigations of negative sequelae due to proximal gait adaptations are warranted.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, no study has examined the possible influence of CWBV intensity on joint loading. It remains unexplored how CWBV intensity impacts joint loading. This study was carried out (1) to quantify the effects of CWBV intensity in terms of vibration frequency and amplitude on the lower limb joint moments and (2) to examine the relationship between leg joint moments and vibration intensity characterized by the platform's acceleration, that is determined by frequency and amplitude, during standing among young adults. Thirty healthy young adults participated in this study. Each participant experienced nine vibration intensity levels dependent upon the frequency (10, 20, and 30 Hz) and amplitude (1, 2, and 3 mm) while standing on a side-alternating vibration platform. Their body kinematics and vertical reaction forces between the feet and platform were collected. Inverse dynamics was employed to calculate the resultant moment for the ankle, knee, and hip joints in the sagittal plane.

The current study aimed to investigate how variation in successive compression exposures influences cumulative load tolerance in the spine. Forty-eight porcine cervical spine units were randomly assigned to one of six combinations of mean peak compression force (30%, 50%, 70% of the predicted tolerance) and loading variation (consistent peak amplitude, variable peak amplitude). Following preload and passive range-of-motion tests, specimens were positioned in a neutral posture and then cyclically loaded in compression until failure occurred or the maximum 12 h duration was reached. Specimens were dissected to classify macroscopic injury and measurements of cumulative load, cycles, and height loss sustained at failure were calculated. Statistical comparisons were made between loading protocols within each normalized compression group. A significant loading variation × compression interaction was demonstrated for cumulative load (p = 0.026) and cycles to failure (p = 0.021). Cumulative compression was reduced under all normalized compression loads (30% p = 0.016; 50% p = 0.030; 70% p = 0.020) when variable loading was incorporated. The largest reduction was by 33% and occurred in the 30% compression group.

The objective of this study was to construct a female-specific equation to predict the fall-induced impact force applied to the hip and evaluate whether it could improve hip facture risk assessment. A previously developed human-body dynamic model was used to simulate falling of 80 women and determine the hip impact force. Results were then used to derive a female-specific equation between impact force and body parameters. The proposed female-specific equation and available non-sex-specific impact force predictors in the literature were integrated with a finite element model to discriminate hip fracture patients among 393 women (99 hip fractures; 294 non-fracture controls). Results of the implemented methods were compared to evaluate whether considering the effect of sex could improve the discrimination of females with and without a hip fracture.

THR patients and a control group underwent three-dimensional motion analysis under self-selected normal and fast walking conditions. Patients were stratified into five age groups for comparison with existing literature. The THR cohort was also stratified into three functional groups determined by their self-selected gait speed (low function <1SD of total cohort's mean walking speed; high function >1SD; normal function within 1SD). Hip kinematics, ground reaction forces, joint moments and joint powers in all three planes (x-y-z) were analysed. 137 THR and 27 healthy control patients participated.

This is partly due to their capability of learning from failure and adapting their control approach and morphological features. This paper proposes an approach that extends the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model with the capability to adapt its attack angle (control) and stiffness (morphology) based on previous locomotion attempts. A set of different update rules, i.e., how this experience is used to adapt, are systematically investigated. The results suggest that modifying either attack angle, or stiffness, or both is beneficial with respect to achieve stable locomotion. Particularly, if the current system configuration (control and morphology) outperforms the previous one, the results suggest that increasing the angle and decreasing the stiffness of the system leads to more stable solutions. Consequently, the basic SLIP model extended by the proposed learning capabilities is able to reach stable locomotion over a much wider range of parameter combinations simply through trial and error.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

To evaluate the effect of freezing and thawing on the biomechanical properties of ex-vivo porcine ocular tissue.


METHODS
Thirty-six porcine eyes (18 pairs) were obtained fresh from a local abattoir and split into two groups of nine pairs to study the effect of storage at -20 °C and -80 °C. A randomly-selected eye from each pair (Control Group, CG) was tested fresh while the fellow eyes were frozen for 14 days, either at -20 °C and -80 °C (Frozen Group, FG) before thawing and testing. Seventy-two strips were extracted from the corneas and scleras of eye globes and subjected to uniaxial tension tests under loads up to 1.0 N. Following five preconditioning cycles, the load and elongation data obtained experimentally were analysed to derive the tissue's stress-strain and tangent modulus-strain behaviour.


RESULTS
Corneal tissue subjected to freezing at -20 °C exhibited significant increases in tangent modulus (mechanical stiffness) by 13 ± 17% (p = 0.003) at 1% strain and 14 ± 12% (p < 0.001) at 2% strain. In contrast, the increases in corneal stiffness at -80 °C were insignificant (6 ± 14%, p = 0.099 at 1% strain, 6 ± 15%, p = 0.091 at 2% strain). The corresponding increases in tangent modulus in the sclera were all insignificant (for -20 °C: 4 ± 14%, p = 0.265 at 1% strain, 3 ± 9%, p = 0.186 at 2% strain; for -80 °C: 3 ± 18%, p = 0.537 at 1% strain and 3 ± 18%, p = 0.491 at 2% strain).

However, there are other compensatory motions such as pelvic obliquity (hip hiking) that could also be used to facilitate foot clearance with greater energy efficiency. Our previous work suggested that hip abduction may not be a compensation for reduced knee flexion after stroke. Previous study applied robotic knee flexion assistance in people with post-stroke Stiff-Knee Gait (SKG) during pre-swing, finding increased abduction despite improved knee flexion and toe clearance. Thus, our hypothesis was that hip abduction is not a compensation for reduced knee flexion. We simulated the kinematics of post-stroke SKG on unimpaired individuals with three factors: a knee orthosis to reduce knee flexion, an ankle-foot orthosis commonly worn by those post-stroke, and matching gait speeds. We compared spatiotemporal measures and kinematics between experimental factors within healthy controls and with a previously recorded cohort of people with post-stroke SKG. We focused on frontal plane motions of hip and pelvis as possible compensatory mechanisms. We observed that regardless of gait speed, knee flexion restriction increased pelvic obliquity (2.8°, p < 0.01) compared to unrestricted walking (1.5°, p < 0.01), but similar to post-stroke SKG (3.4°). However, those with post-stroke SKG had greater hip abduction (8.2°) compared to unimpaired individuals with restricted knee flexion (4.2°, p < 0.05). These results show that pelvic obliquity, not hip abduction, compensates for reduced knee flexion angle.

The results provide support for the use of collocation-Fourier series approach to predict clinically relevant blood flow distribution and collateral blood supply in large portions of the cerebral circulation at reasonable computational costs. It thus opens the possibility of performing computationally inexpensive subject-specific simulations that are robust and fast enough to predict clinical results in real time on the same day.,True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This research aimed to assess postural stability during gait in a group of adults with HSP. Ten individuals with HSP and 10 healthy controls underwent computerized gait analysis while walking barefoot along a 10-m track. Two biomechanics methods were used to assess stability: the center of pressure and center of mass separation (COP-COM) method, and the extrapolated center of mass (XCOM) method. Spatiotemporal and kinematic variables were also investigated. The XCOM method identified deficits in mediolateral stability for the HSP group at both heel strike and mid-stance. The group with HSP also had slower walking velocity, lower cadence, more time spent in double stance, larger step widths, and greater lateral trunk flexion than the control group. These results suggest that individuals with HSP adjust characteristics of their gait to minimize the instability arising from their impairments but have residual deficits in mediolateral stability. This may result in an increased risk of falls, particularly in the sideways direction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of volitional and non-volitional muscle activity in subject-specific responses to knee extension assistance during walking with an exoskeleton. We developed a simulation framework to predict responses to exoskeleton torque by applying a stretch-reflex spasticity model with muscle excitations computed during unassisted walking. The framework was validated with data collected from six individuals with CP. Framework-predicted knee angle at terminal swing was within 4 ± 4° (mean ± sd) of the knee angle measured experimentally without the addition of spasticity. Kinematic responses in two-thirds of the participants could be accurately modeled using only underlying muscle activity and the applied exoskeleton torque; incorporating hamstring spasticity was necessary to recreate the measured kinematics to within 1 ± 1° in the remaining participants. We observed strong positive linear relationships between knee extension and exoskeleton assistance, and strong negative quadratic relationships between knee extension and spasticity. We utilized our framework to identify optimal torque profiles necessary to achieve full knee-extension at foot contact. An angular impulse of 0.061 ± 0.025 Nm·s·kg-1·deg-1 with 0.013 ± 0.002 Nm·kg-1·deg-1 of peak torque and 4.1 ± 1.9 W·kg-1·deg-1 peak mechanical power was required to achieve full knee extension (values normalized by knee excursion).

The source of the increased passive stiffness in patients is not understood and while whole muscle down to single muscle fibres have been investigated, the smallest functional unit of muscle (the sarcomere) has not been. Muscle biopsies (adductor longus and gracilis) from pediatric patients were obtained (CP n = 9 and control n = 2) and analyzed for mechanical stiffness, in-vivo sarcomere length and titin isoforms. Adductor longus muscle was the focus of this study and the results for sarcomere length showed a significant increase in length for CP (3.6 µm) compared to controls (2.6 µm). Passive stress at the same sarcomere length for CP compared to control was significantly lower in CP and the elastic modulus for the physiological range of muscle was lower in CP compared to control (98.2 kPa and 166.1 kPa, respectively). Our results show that CP muscle at its most reduced level (the myofibril) is more compliant compared to normal, which is completely opposite to what is observed at higher structural levels (single fibres, muscle fibre bundles and whole muscle). It is noteworthy that at the in vivo sarcomere length in CP, the passive forces are greater than normal, purely as a functional of these more compliant sarcomeres operating at long lengths. Titin isoforms were not different between CP and non-CP adductor longus but titin:nebulin was reduced in CP muscle, which may be due to titin loss or an over-expression of nebulin in CP muscles.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previously, these systems have been integrated with research-grade motion capture systems to provide both functionalities; however, they are yet to be used as stand-alone systems for kinematic data collection. The present study aimed to validate the HTC VIVE VR system for kinematic data collection by evaluating the accuracy of its position and orientation signals. The VIVE controller and tracker were each compared to a Polhemus Liberty magnetic tracking system sensor for angular and translational measurement error and signal drift. A sensor from each system was mounted to opposite ends of a rigid segment which was driven through fifty rotations and fifty translations. Mean angular errors for both the VIVE tracker and controller were below 0.4°. Mean translational error for both sensors was below 3 mm. Drift in the Liberty signal components was consistently lower than drift in VIVE components. However, all mean rotational drift measures were below 0.1° and all mean translational measures were below 0.35 mm.

The impact of birthing position and mobility on pelvic alignment during labor has not been adequately explored. Our objective was to use a previously developed computational model of the female pelvis to determine the effects of maternal positioning and pregnancy on pelvic alignment. We hypothesized that loading conditions during squatting and increased ligament laxity during pregnancy would expand the pelvis. We simulated dynamic joint moments experienced during a squat movement under pregnant and non-pregnant conditions while tracking relevant anatomical landmarks on the innominate bones, sacrum, and coccyx; anteroposterior and transverse diameters, pubic symphysis width and angle, pelvic areas at the inlet, mid-plane, and outlet, were calculated. Pregnant simulation conditions resulted in greater increases in most pelvic measurements - and predominantly at the outlet - than for the non-pregnant simulation. Pelvic outlet diameters in anterior-posterior and transverse directions in the final squat posture increased by 6.1 mm and 11.0 mm, respectively, for the pregnant simulation compared with only 4.1 mm and 2.6 mm for the non-pregnant; these differences were considered to be clinically meaningful. Peak increases in diameter were demonstrated during the dynamic portion of the movement, rather than the final resting position. Outcomes from our computational simulation suggest that maternal joint loading in an upright birthing position, such as squatting, could open the outlet of the birth canal and dynamic activities may generate greater pelvic mobility than the comparable static posture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty-three experienced place kickers performed maximum effort place kicks, whilst three-dimensional kinematic (240 Hz) and ground reaction force (960 Hz) data were recorded. Kicking leg and torso mechanics were compared between the more successful ('long') kickers and two sub groups of less successful kickers ('short' and 'wide-left') using magnitude-based inferences and statistical parametric mapping. Short kickers achieved substantially slower ball velocities compared with the long kickers (20.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. 27.6 ± 1.7 m/s, respectively) due to performing substantially less positive hip flexor (normalised mean values = 0.071 vs. 0.092) and knee extensor (0.004 vs. 0.009) joint work throughout the downswing, which may be associated with their more front-on body orientation, and potentially a lack of strength or intent. Wide-left kickers achieved comparable ball velocities (26.9 ± 1.6 m/s) to the long kickers, but they were less accurate due to substantially more longitudinal ball spin and a misdirected linear ball velocity. Wide-left kickers created a tension arc across the torso and therefore greater positive hip flexor joint work (normalised mean = 0.112) throughout the downswing than the long kickers. Whilst this may have assisted kicking foot velocity, it also induced greater longitudinal torso rotation during the downswing, and may have affected the ability of the hip to control the direction of the foot trajectory.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nacre with more than 90% brittle and hard phase and a little protein matrix, exhibits high strength and toughness, which is difficult to achieve in artificial materials. Researchers have shown that the toughness of nacre is related to the cracking process. Most of them, however, assume an obvious pre-existing crack on the model and the initiation of the microscopical pre-existing crack is not considered yet. Based on fracture mechanics with the cohesive zone model, we reveal the mechanism of the crack initiation and propagation pattern in staggered biomaterials without any pre-existing crack. The simulation result shows that there are two crack propagation modes: localized mode and unlocalized mode. A crack initiates and propagates in a small area in the localized mode, while cracks initiate at different points and propagate in various paths in the unlocalized mode. The crack initiation mechanism from the intrinsic properties of the material is clarified using energy based stability analysis. The result shows that the shear interfacial mechanism significantly delays the crack initiation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This method is restrictive (and often expensive), and limits the ability to perform analyses outside of the lab. In the present study, we used a markerless deep learning-based method to perform 2D kinematic analysis of deep water running, a task that poses several challenges to image processing methods. A single GoPro camera recorded sagittal plane lower limb motion. A deep neural network was trained using data from 17 individuals, and then used to predict the locations of markers that approximated joint centres. We found that 300-400 labelled images were sufficient to train the network to be able to position joint markers with an accuracy similar to that of a human labeler (mean difference < 3 pixels, around 1 cm). This level of accuracy is sufficient for many 2D applications, such as sports biomechanics, coaching/training, and rehabilitation. The method was sensitive enough to differentiate between closely-spaced running cadences (45-85 strides per minute in increments of 5). We also found high test-retest reliability of mean stride data, with between-session correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.97. Our approach represents a low-cost, adaptable solution for kinematic analysis, and could easily be modified for use in other movements and settings. Using additional cameras, this approach could also be used to perform 3D analyses. The method presented here may have broad applications in different fields, for example by enabling markerless motion analysis to be performed during rehabilitation, training or even competition environments.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Directions of particular forces were presented using a femoral coordinate system. Attachment points for all muscle forces were obtained on the basis of the unscaled standard model with the length of the femur equal to 0.41 m.

In this study, changes in key molecular signals and pathways in cardiovascular development have been investigated under microgravity conditions. In particular, the caudal vein plexus (CVP) network, formed by sprouting angiogenesis has been chosen. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to SM using a ground-based microgravity bioreactor for 24 and 36 h. The SM was observed to have no effect on the zebrafish length, tail width and incubation time whereas it was observed to significantly reduce the heart rate frequency and to promote abnormal development of the CVP network in the embryos. Nitric oxide (NO) content demonstrated that the total proteins in zebrafish embryos were significantly higher in SM than in the control group grown under normal conditions. It was then preliminarily determined how NO signals were involved in SM regulated zebrafish CVP network formation. nos2b MO was injected and CVP network evolution was observed in 36 h post fertilization (hpf) under SM condition. The results showed that the CVP network formation was considerably decreased in the nos2b MO treated group. However, this inhibition of the CVP network development was not observed in control MO group, indicating that nos2b is involved in the SM-regulated vascular development process in zebrafish. Moreover, specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors such as LY294002 were also tested on zebrafish embryos under SM condition. This treatment significantly inhibited the formation of zebrafish CVP network. Furthermore, overexpression of nos2b partly rescued the LY294002-caused CVP network failure. Therefore, it can be concluded that SM affects zebrafish CVP network remodeling by enhancing angiogenesis.

The geometrical dimensions, as well as the QCT-values expressed in Hounsfield unit (HU) distribution was compared. Principal strains at representative regions of interest (ROIs), and maximum principal strains (associated with fracture risk) were compared. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate strain prediction reliability for different scanners. Repeatability was examined by scanning the femur twice and comparing resulting QCTFE models. Maximum difference in geometry was 2.3%. HU histograms before phantom calibration showed wide variation between QCT scans; however, bone density histogram variability was reduced after calibration and algorithmic manipulation. Relative standard deviation (RSD) in principal strains at ROIs was <10.7%. ICC estimates between scanners were >0.9. Fracture-associated strain had 6.7%, 8.1%, and 13.3% maximum RSD for the femur, humerus, and proximal femur, respectively. The difference in maximum strain location was <2 mm.

Fracture-associated strains in ""regular"" bones showed a mean RSD bounded by ∼8%.

Furthermore, these options may differentially affect the response to different gait perturbations, which is problematic when comparing groups with different capacities. We present a method for decreasing inter-individual differences in gait stability by adjusting walking speed to equivalent margins of stability (MoS). Eighteen healthy adults walked on a split-belt treadmill for two-minute bouts at 0.4 m/s up to 1.8 m/s in 0.2 m/s intervals. The stability-normalised walking speed (MoS = 0.05 m) was calculated using the mean MoS at touchdown of the final 10 steps of each speed. Participants then walked for three minutes at this speed and were subsequently exposed to a treadmill belt acceleration perturbation. A further 12 healthy adults were exposed to the same perturbation while walking at 1.3 m/s: the average of the previous group. Large ranges in MoS were observed during the prescribed speeds (6-10 cm across speeds) and walking speed significantly (P < 0.001) affected MoS. The stability-normalised walking speeds resulted in MoS equal or very close to the desired 0.05 m and reduced between-participant variability in MoS. The second group of participants walking at 1.3 m/s had greater inter-individual variation in MoS during both unperturbed and perturbed walking compared to 12 sex, height and leg length-matched participants from the stability-normalised walking speed group. The current method decreases inter-individual differences in gait stability which may benefit gait perturbation and stability research, in particular studies on populations with different locomotor capacities.

Patients with hemiparesis frequently fall toward the anterior direction; however, whether this is due to impaired WBAM control in the sagittal plane during gait remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the differences in WBAM in the sagittal plane during gait between patients with hemiparesis and healthy individuals. Thirty-three chronic stroke patients with hemiparesis and twenty-two age- and gender-matched healthy controls walked along a 7-m walkway while gait data were recorded using a motion analysis system and force plates. WBAM and joint moment were calculated in the sagittal plane during each gait cycle.

Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed the slower walking speed (P < 0.001) and larger knee extension moment on the non-paretic side (P = 0.003) contributed to the larger range of WBAM in the sagittal plane in the second half of the paretic gait cycle. Our findings suggest that dynamic stability in the sagittal plane is impaired in the second half of the paretic gait cycle.

In performing these data reductions, information is discarded from the measurement before it can be evaluated, leading to unkonwn consequences. In this study, we aim to provide the first assessment of what impact data reduction techniques have on plantar pressure measurements. Specifically, we quantify the extent to which information of any kind is discarded when performing common data reductions. Plantar pressure measurements were collected from 33 healthy controls, 8 Hallux Valgus patients, and 10 Metatarsalgia patients. Eleven common data reductions were then applied to the measurements, and the resulting datasets were compared to the original measurement in three ways. First, information theory was used to estimate the information content present in the original and reduced datasets. Second, principal component analysis was used to estimate the number of intrinsic dimensions present. Finally, a permutational multivariate ANOVA was performed to evaluate the significance of group differences between the healthy controls, Hallux Valgus, and Metatarsalgia groups. The evaluated data reductions showed a minimum of 99.1% loss in information content and losses of dimensionality between 20.8% and 83.3%. Significant group differences were also lost after each of the 11 data reductions (α=0.05), but these results may differ for other patient groups (especially those with highly-deformed footprints) or other region of interest definitions.

Loss of contact between the femoral and tibial implants following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been related to accelerated polyethylene wear and other complications. Two methods have been used to detect loss of contact in single-plane fluoroscopy, the condylar lift-off method and the separation method. The objectives were to assess the ability of each method to detect loss of contact.


METHODS
TKA was performed on ten cadaveric knee specimens. Tibial force was measured in each compartment as specimens were flexed from 0° to 90° while internal-external and varus-valgus moments were applied. Single-plane radiographs taken simultaneously with tibial force were analyzed for loss of contact using the two methods. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and optimum threshold distances were determined.


RESULTS
For the lift-off method and the separation method, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.89 vs 0.60 for the lateral compartment only and 0.81 vs 0.70 for the medial compartment only, respectively. For the lift-off method, the optimum threshold distances were 0.7 mm in the lateral compartment only and 0.1 mm in the medial compartment only but the false positive rate for the medial compartment only almost doubled. For both compartments jointly, the areas under the ROC curves decreased to 0.70 and 0.59 for the lift-off and separation methods, respectively.


CONCLUSION
When detecting loss of contact using single-plane fluoroscopy, the lift-off method is useful for the lateral compartment only but not for the medial compartment only and not for both compartments jointly. The separation method is not useful.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, reliability and validity data were lacking for axial and resultant PTAs along the speed range of over-ground endurance running. A wearable system was developed to continuously measure 3D tibial acceleration and to detect PTAs in real-time. Thirteen rearfoot runners ran at 2.55, 3.20 and 5.10 m·s-1 over an instrumented runway in two sessions with re-attachment of the system. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine within-session reliability. Repeatability was evaluated by paired T-tests and ICCs. Concerning validity, axial and resultant PTAs were correlated to the peak vertical impact loading rate (LR) of the ground reaction force. Additionally, speed should affect impact loading magnitude. Hence, magnitudes were compared across speeds by RM-ANOVA. Within a session, ICCs were over 0.90 and reasonable for clinical measurements. Between sessions, the magnitudes remained statistically similar with ICCs ranging from 0.50 to 0.59 for axial PTA and from 0.53 to 0.81 for resultant PTA. Peak accelerations of the lower leg segment correlated to LR with larger coefficients for axial PTA (r range: 0.64-0.84) than for the resultant PTA per speed condition. The magnitude of each impact measure increased with speed. These data suggest that PTAs registered per stand-alone system can be useful during level, over-ground, rearfoot running to evaluate impact loading in the time domain when force platforms are unavailable in studies with repeated measurements.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

To better protect soldiers from that threat, the injury risk level when protected and unprotected must be assessed. Knowing from the literature that a possible amplification of the blast threat would be provided by some thoracic protective systems, the objective is to propose an original approach to correlate a measurable parameter on a manikin with a pulmonary risk level. Using a manikin whose response is correlated with the proposed tolerance limits should help in the evaluation of thoracic protective system regarding injury outcomes. A database including lung injury data from large mammals have been created, allowing the definition of iso-impulse tolerance limits from no lung injury to severe ones (∼60% of ecchymosis). As the use of this metric is not sufficient to evaluate the performance of protective systems on a manikin, the iso-impulse tolerance limits were associated with the thoracic response of post-mortem swine under blast loading. It was found that the lung injury threshold in terms of incident impulse is 58.3 kPa·ms, corresponding to a chest wall peak of acceleration/velocity/displacement of 7350 m/s2, 3.7 m/s and 6.4 mm respectively. Lung injuries are considered as severe (30-60% of ecchymosis) when the incident impulse exceed 232.8 kPa·ms, leading to a chest wall peak of acceleration/velocity/displacement of 79.7 km/s2, 14.7 m/s and 30.1 mm respectively.

Incorrect positions from the native equations were demonstrated (Sangeux et al., 2014; Harrington et al., 2007). More accurate equations were proposed but their impact on kinematics and kinetic CGM outputs was never evaluated. This short communication aims at examining if adoption of new HJC equations would alter standard CGM outputs. Sixteen able bodied participants underwent a full 3-D optoelectronic gait analysis followed by a 3-D ultrasound localization of their hips. Data were processed through the open source python package pyCGM2 replicating kinematic and kinetic processing of the native CGM. Compared with 3D ultrasound location, Hara equations improved the accuracy of sagittal plane kinematics (0.6°) and kinetics (0.02 N m kg-1) for the hip. The worst case participant exhibited Harrington's equations reached a deviation of 3° for the sagittal kinematics. In the coronal plane, Hara and Harrington equations presented similar differences (1°) for the hip whilst Davis equations had the largest deviation for hip abduction (2.7°) and hip abductor moment (0.10 N m kg-1). Both Harrington and Hara equations improved the CGM location of the HJC. Hara equations improved results in the sagittal plane, plus utilise a single anthropometrics measurement, leg length, that may be more robust. However, neither set of equations had significant effect on kinematics. We reported some effects on kinetics, particularly in the coronal plane, which warrant caution in interpreting outputs using different sets of equations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Particularly, tissue rigidity is important during tumor carcinogenesis as it affects the tumor's ability to metastasis. Multiple downstream pathways are affected with a difference in rigidity of the extracellular matrix. The insight into tumor mechanosignalling represents a promising field that may lead to novel approaches for cancer diagnostics. Measurement of rigidity of the extracellular matrix or the tissue is a potential diagnostics approach for cancer detection. Altered extracellular matrix states persist for a long period of time and have lower heterogeneity compared to protein or genetic markers, therefore are more reliable as biomarkers. On the other hand, measurement of different kinase associated proteins or transcripts provide an early insight into potential transition of cells towards metastasis. Co-localization of transcriptional factors like YAP/TAZ provide an insight to determine if the cells are undergoing metastatic changes.

However, a physiological benefit can be partially negated by excessive or unphysiological loads within the joints. To gain an initial understanding into this, the present study sought to compare joint loading between walking and cycling in children. With institutional ethical approval, 14 pre-pubertal children aged 8-12 walked on an instrumented treadmill and cycled on a stationary ergometer. Two methods were used to match physiological load. Cardiovascular loads between walking and cycling were matched using heart rate. Metabolic load was normalised by matching estimates of oxygen consumption. Joint reaction forces during cycling and walking as well as joint moments were derived using inverse dynamics. Peak compressive forces were greater on the knees and ankles during walking than during cycling. Peak shear peak forces at the knee and ankle were also significantly larger during walking than during cycling, independent of how physiological load was normalised. For both cycling conditions, ankle moments were significantly smaller during cycling than walking. No differences were found for knee moments. At equivalent physiological intensities, cycling results in less joint loading than walking. It can be speculated that for certain populations and under certain conditions cycling might be a more suitable mode of exercise than weight bearing activities to achieve a given metabolic load.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to identify gait deviations caused by increased femoral antetorsion and to perform subgroup analyses based on sagittal knee kinematics. Patients with isolated, CT confirmed increased femoral antetorsion (n = 42) and age-matched typically developing children (TDC, n = 17) were included in this study. Patients were referred to gait analysis because of gait abnormalities going along with an increased femoral antetorsion ≥30°. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded during 3D gait analysis and three valid gait cycles were analyzed. Principal component (PC) analysis was used to achieve data transformation. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the group effect of PC-scores of retained PCs explaining 90% of the cumulative variance. Group effects of PC-scores revealed that patients walked with more flexed hips and greater anterior pelvic tilt throughout the gait cycle. Knee flexion was increased in patients during mid and terminal stance. Increased frontal plane knee and hip joint moments were found for patients compared to TDC. Furthermore, dividing patients into two subgroups based on their sagittal knee kinematics showed that kinematic gait deviations were more pronounced in patients with higher femoral antetorsion, while deviations in joint moments were more pronounced in patients with lower femoral antetorsion. Increased femoral antetorsion showed alterations in all lower limb joints and may be not only a cosmetic problem. Therefore, 3D gait analysis should be used for clinical management and operative treatment should be considered depending on severity of gait deviations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While Dacron is chosen for aortic grafts because of characteristics such as biocompatibility and durability, few data are available about the dynamic response of Dacron prosthetic devices and about their side effects on the cardiovascular system. In this study, a Dacron graft was subjected to physiological flow conditions in a specifically-developed mock circulatory loop. Experiments were conducted at different physiological pulsation-per-minute rates. Results show that, in comparison to an aortic segment of the same length, the prosthesis is extremely stiffer circumferentially, thus limiting the dynamical radial expansion responsible for the Windkessel effect in human arteries. The prosthesis is instead excessively compliant in the axial direction and develops preferentially bending oscillations.

We investigated concurrent validity of head tracking of two Head Mounted Displays (HMDs), Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, vs. a gold-standard motion capture system (Qualisys). Head kinematics of N = 20 healthy young adults was quantified during static and dynamic postural tasks. While wearing the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, participants observed moving stars (static tasks) or a flying ball (dynamic task). Head kinematics were recorded simultaneously by the Rift or Vive and Qualisys camera system. We calculated head directional path, acceleration in 6 directions and volume of translation movement. Intra-Class Correlations (ICC) and 95% Limits of agreement were calculated. Most ICC values were around 0.9 with several at 0.99 indicating excellent agreement between the HMDs and Qualisys. Weaker agreement was observed for vertical displacement during a static task and moderate agreement was observed pitch and yaw displacement during a dynamic task. A negative bias of a small magnitude (indicating more movement in VR) was observed for most variables in static tasks, while a positive bias was observed for most variables in the dynamic task (indicating less movement in VR). Our results generally support the concurrent validity of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive head tracking during static and dynamic standing tasks in healthy young adults.

About 33% of affected children experience permanent osseous deformities of the glenohumeral joint. Recent evidence suggests that some cases experience restricted muscle longitudinal growth in addition to paralysis and reduced range of motion at the shoulder and elbow. It is unknown whether altered loading due to paralysis, muscle growth restriction and contracture, or static loading due to disuse is the primary driver of joint deformity after BPBI. This study uses a computational framework integrating finite element analysis and musculoskeletal modeling to examine the mechanical factors contributing to changes in bone growth and morphometry following BPBI. Simulations of 8 weeks of glenohumeral growth in a rat model of BPBI predicted that static loading of the joint is primarily responsible for joint deformation consistent with experimental measures of bone morphology, whereas dynamic loads resulted in normal bone growth. Under dynamic loading, glenoid version angle (GVA), glenoid inclination angle (GIA), and glenoid radius of curvature (GRC) (-1.3°, 38.2°, 2.5 mm respectively) were similar to the baseline values (-1.8°, -38°, 2.1 mm respectively). In the static case with unrestricted muscle growth, these measures increased in magnitude (5.2°, -48°, 3.5 mm respectively). More severe joint deformations were observed in GIA and GRC when muscle growth was restricted (GVA: 3.6°, GIA: -55°, GRC: 4.0 mm). Predicted morphology was consistent with literature reports of in vivo glenoid morphology following postganglionic BPBI.

Ultrasound images were used to measure mCSA. Males had greater slopes from the MUAPAMP-RT relationship than the females (P < 0.05). The greater slopes likely reflected larger higher-threshold MUs for the males. The mCSAs and slopes from the relationships were strongly correlated with isometric and isokinetic peak torque and isokinetic mean power (r = 0.78-0.82), however, type I %MHC isoform was only moderately correlated with isometric peak torque (r = -0.54).

Studies in rats have shown that transverse loads result in a decrease in the longitudinal muscle force. Changes in muscle architecture during contraction may contribute to the observed force decrease. The aim of this study was to quantify changes in pennation angle, fascicle dimensions, and muscle thickness during contraction under external transverse load. Electrical stimuli were elicited to evoke maximal force twitches in the right calf muscles of humans. Trials were conducted with transverse loads of 2, 4.5, and 10 kg. An ultrasound probe was placed on the medial gastrocnemius in line with the transverse load to quantify muscle characteristics during muscle twitches. Maximum twitch force decreased with increased transverse muscle loading. The 2, 4.5, and 10 kg of transverse load showed a 9, 13, and 16% decrease in longitudinal force, respectively. Within the field of view of the ultrasound images, and thus directly beneath the external load, loading of the muscle resulted in a decrease in the muscle thickness and pennation angle, with higher loads causing greater decreases. During twitches the muscle transiently increased in thickness and pennation angle, as did fascicle thickness. Higher transverse loads showed a reduced increase in muscle thickness. Smaller increases in pennation angle and fascicle thickness strain also occurred with higher transverse loads. This study shows that increased transverse loading caused a decrease in ankle moment, muscle thickness, and pennation angle, as well as transverse deformation of the fascicles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) can measure motion without any spatial restriction and are thus becoming a popular tool to investigate sports biomechanics. Biomechanical analysis of hitting requires the accurate detection of key events including ""foot-off"" while leaning back (FOff), ""foot-on"" during forward swing (FOn), and ball impact. Ten male university baseball players hit a ball suspended on a T pole five times in kick-hitting and glide-hitting styles. Three IMUs were attached on mid-pelvis and on each hand to record acceleration and orientation data. The key events identified by the three IMUs were compared with those retrieved by an optical motion capture system with force platforms. The timings of the local peak acceleration of the pelvis in the direction of the pitcher that were recorded by the IMU closely matched those of FOff and FOn events detected by the ground reaction force. Root mean square error (RMSE) between each measurement for the FOff and FOn events were 0.024 and 0.031 s, respectively. The timing of the negative peak of acceleration in the proximal direction of the hands corresponded to the impact time determined by an optical motion capture system. RMSEs for the knob and barrel-side hand were 0.009 and 0.011 s, respectively.

Finite-element calculations of femoral strain, muscle, and joint forces for five different activity types were obtained previously. Multi-linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and Gaussian process were trained for 50, 100, 200, and 300 random samples generated using Latin Hypercube (LH) and Design of Experiment (DOE) sampling.

Prior research has shown that athletes who land in a stiff manner, with larger internal knee adduction and extension moments, are at greater risk for an ACL injury. A three-dimensional accelerometer placed at the tibial tuberosity may prove to be a low-cost means of assessing these risk factors. The primary purpose of this study was to compare tibial accelerations during drop landings with kinematic and kinetic risk factors for ACL injury measured with three-dimensional motion capture. The secondary purpose of this study was to compare these measures between soft and stiff landings. Participants were instructed to land bilaterally in preferred, soft, and stiff manners. Peak knee flexion decreased significantly from soft to stiff landings. Peak internal knee extension moment, peak anterior/posterior knee acceleration, and peak medial knee acceleration all increased significantly from soft to stiff landings. No associations were found between landing condition and either frontal plane knee angle at maximum vertical ground reaction force or peak internal knee adduction moment. Significant positive associations between kinetics and accelerations were found only in the sagittal plane. As such, while a three-dimensional accelerometer could discern between soft and stiff landings in both planes, it may be better suited to predict kinetic risk factors in the sagittal plane.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Balancing can be defined as equal collateral ligament tensions or equal medial and lateral compartmental forces during the flexion range. Our goal was to study the effects on balancing of linear femoral component misplacements (proximal, distal, anterior, posterior); and different component rotations in mechanical alignment compared to kinematic alignment throughout the flexion path. A test rig was constructed such that the position of a standard femoral component could be adjusted to simulate the linear and rotational positions. With the knee in neutral reference values of the collateral tensions were adjusted to give anatomic contact force patterns, measured with an instrumented tibial trial. The deviations in the forces for each femoral component position were then determined. Compartmental forces were significantly influenced by 2 mm linear errors in the femoral component placement. However, the errors were least for a distal error, equivalent to undercutting the distal femur. The largest errors mainly increase the lateral condyle force, occurred for proximal and posterior component errors. There were only small contact force differences between kinematic and mechanical alignment. Based on these results, surgeons should avoid overcutting the distal femur and undercutting the posterior femur. However, the 2-3 degrees varus slope of the joint line as in kinematic alignment did not have much effect on balancing, so mechanical or kinematic alignment were equivalent.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We measured static and dynamic plantar pressures from five pairs of each twin type. Statistical parametric modeling was used to compare pressure distributions at the sensor level. For >80% of stance phase, the pixel level analysis indicated that monozygotic twins had less variation in plantar pressure between pairs. The average z-statistic across the entire trial was 0.88 for the monozygotic group and 1.13 for the dizygotic group.

We used the spring-mass model to calculate vertical stiffness, which equals the ratio of maximum vertical ground reaction force to maximum center of mass displacement, while the athlete with a BKA hopped on one leg at a range of frequencies. Then, we compared the vertical stiffness of this athlete to seven non-amputee elite-level long-jumpers. We found that from 1.8 to 3.4 Hz, the vertical stiffness of the unaffected leg for an athlete with a BKA increases with faster hopping frequencies, but the vertical stiffness of the affected leg remains nearly constant across frequencies. The athlete with a BKA attained the desired hopping frequencies at 2.2 and 2.6 Hz, but was unable to match the lowest (1.8 Hz) and two highest frequencies (3.0 and 3.4 Hz) using his affected leg.

The HJC of a generic musculoskeletal model was also perturbed to compute the root-mean squared error (RMSE) of the hip muscle moment arms between the reference HJC obtained from CT and the different scaling methods. Shape modelling without medical imaging data significantly reduced HJC location error estimates (11.4 ± 3.3 mm) compared to functional (36.9 ± 17.5 mm, p = <0.001) and regression (31.2 ± 15 mm, p = <0.001) methods. The addition of complete pelvis imaging data to the shape modelling workflow further reduced HJC error estimates compared to no imaging (6.6 ± 3.1 mm, p = 0.002). Average RMSE were greatest for the hip flexor and extensor muscle groups using the functional (16.71 mm and 8.87 mm respectively) and regression methods (16.15 mm and 9.97 mm respectively). The effects on moment-arms were less substantial for the shape modelling methods, ranging from 0.05 to 3.2 mm. Shape modelling methods improved HJC location and muscle moment-arm estimates compared to linear scaling of musculoskeletal models in patients with hip osteoarthritis.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, dynamic changes in cell mechanics were monitored under Aβ-induced toxicity. To investigate the changes in cellular mechanical properties, we used Aβ1-42 oligomer at different concentrations to treat human neuroblastoma SH-SY5H cells. Results demonstrated a two-stage dynamic change in cell mechanics during neurodegeneration. Additionally, Young's modulus (YM) of the treated cells increased in a short period. The reasons include alteration in surface tension, osmotic pressure, and actin polymerization. Rough cellular membranes were observed from atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement. However, the cellular YM gradually decreased when the cells were continuously exposed to Aβ1-42 or to a high concentration of Aβ1-42. The major reason for the decreased YM was microtubule disassembly. Dynamic change in YM reflects different activities in cytoplasm in response to Aβ1-42. The characteristic changes in cell mechanics provided insights into the dynamic neurodegeneration process of cells induced by Aβ1-42 oligomer.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty-six participants (20 males and 16 females) ran at 4.0 m/s using either: their preferred stride length (PSL), or strides 15% longer (LSL) and shorter (SSL) than PSL. Leg stiffness and vGRF measures, including peak vGRF, impact peak and loading rate, were submitted to a RM ANOVA to test the main effect and interactions of load, stride length, and sex. Leg stiffness was greater with the 30 kg (p = 0.016) and 35 kg (p < 0.001) compared to the 20 kg load, but decreased as stride lengthened from SSL to PSL (p < 0.001) and PSL to LSL (p < 0.001). Males exhibited greater leg stiffness than females with SSL (p = 0.029). Yet, males decreased leg stiffness with each increase in stride length (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), while females only decreased leg stiffness between PSL and LSL (p = 0.014). Peak vGRF was greater with the addition of body borne load (p < 0.001) and increase in stride length (p < 0.001).

Influence of different modelling assumptions and approaches on model outputs are still not fully understood, while direct comparisons of standard approaches have been rarely undertaken. This study seeks to compare joint kinematics, joint kinetics and estimated muscle forces of two standard approaches offered in two different modelling environments (AnyBody, OpenSim). It is hypothesised that distinctive differences exist for individual muscles, while summing up synergists show general agreement. Experimental data of 10 healthy participants (28 ± 5 years, 1.72 ± 0.08 m, 69 ± 12 kg) was used for a standard static optimisation muscle force estimation routine in AnyBody and OpenSim while using two gait-specific musculoskeletal models. Statistical parameter mapping paired t-test was used to compare joint angle, moment and muscle force waveforms in Matlab. Results showed differences especially in sagittal ankle and hip angles as well as sagittal knee moments. Differences were also found for some of the muscles, especially of the triceps surae group and the biceps femoris short head, which occur as a result of different anthropometric and anatomical definitions (mass and inertia of segments, muscle properties) and scaling procedures (static vs. dynamic). Understanding these differences and their cause is crucial to operate such modelling environments in a clinical setting.

Identifying normal motion within an individual is complicated by the considerable variation in movement patterns amongst healthy individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize sources of variation in spine motion among a sample of healthy participants. The second objective of this study was to develop a multivariate model capable of predicting an expected movement pattern for an individual. The kinematic shape of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine was recorded during a constrained dynamic trunk flexion movement; as this is not a normal everyday movement task, movements are considered 'typical' and 'atypical' for this task rather than 'normal' and 'abnormal'. Variations in neutral standing posture accounted for 85% of the variation in spine motion throughout the task. Differences in total spine range of flexion and a regional re-weighting of range of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions explained a further 9% of the variance among individuals. The analysis also highlighted a difference in temporal sequencing of motion between lower thoracic and lumbar regions which explained 2% of the total movement variation. These identified sources of variation were used to select independent variables for a multivariate linear model capable of predicting an individuals' expected movement pattern. This was done as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the error between predicted and observed motion patterns could be used to differentiate between 'typical' and 'atypical' movement strategies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Linear and angular accelerations of all segments within a multi-linked system can be expressed as the sum of contributions from a joint torque term, gravitational force term and motion-dependent term (MDT), where the MDT is a nonlinear term consisting of centrifugal force, Coriolis force and gyroscopic effect moment components. Direct effects result from angular accelerations induced by a joint torque at a given instant, whereas indirect effects arise through the MDT induced by joint torques exerted in the past. These two effects were quantified for the kicking-side leg during a rugby place kick. The MDT was the largest contributor to the foot centre of gravity (CG)'s speed at ball contact. Of the factors responsible for generating the MDT, the direct and indirect effects of the hip flexion-extension torque during both the flight phase (from the final kicking foot take-off to support foot contact) and the subsequent support phase (from support foot contact to ball contact) were important contributors to the foot CG's speed at ball contact. The indirect effect of the ankle plantar-dorsal flexion torque and the direct effect of the knee flexion-extension torque during the support phase showed the largest positive and negative contributions to the foot CG's speed at ball contact, respectively. The proposed method allows the identification of which individual joint torque axes are crucial and the timings of joint torque exertion that are used to generate a high speed of the distal point of a multi-linked system.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DTI tractography have been used to reconstruct the architecture of human muscles in vivo. However, muscle architecture measurements reconstructed with conventional DTI techniques are often anatomically implausible because the reconstructed fascicles do not terminate on aponeuroses, as real muscle fascicles are known to do. In this study, we tested the reliability of an anatomically constrained DTI-based method for measuring three-dimensional muscle architecture. Anatomical magnetic resonance images and diffusion tensor images were obtained from the left legs of eight healthy participants on two occasions one week apart. Muscle volumes, fascicle lengths, pennation angles and fascicle curvatures were measured in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and the tibialis anterior muscles. Averaged across muscles, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 for muscle volume, 0.81 for fascicle length, 0.73 for pennation angle and 0.76 for fascicle curvature. Measurements of muscle architecture obtained using conventional DTI tractography were highly sensitive to variations in the stopping criteria for DTI tractography. The application of anatomical constraints reduced this sensitivity significantly. This study demonstrates that anatomically constrained DTI tractography can provide reliable and robust three-dimensional measurements of whole-muscle architecture. The algorithms used to constrain tractography have been made publicly available.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous research has shown that joint axis definition affects estimated joint moments about the forefoot. However, little is known about how metatarsophalangeal joint center definition affects estimated joint kinetics. This study compared moments about the metatarsophalangeal joint using four different defined joint centers. There was a significant difference (p < .001) in peak moments between joint center definitions, differing by up to 0.488 N-m/kg for the slow and 0.878 N-m/kg for the fast running speeds tested. Additionally, there was a significant difference (p < .001) for when peak plantar flexor moment occurred during the slower running condition. The more posteriorly oriented joint centers resulted in higher moments and earlier onset of the plantar flexor moment. In addition to careful modeling of the metatarsophalangeal joint axis, it is recommended that joint center definition should be considered as well.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In our approach, we decompose bone displacement via a set of basis functions, identified via principal component analysis (PCA). We utilized MRI wrist scans acquired at multiple static positions for deriving these basis functions. We then utilized these basis functions to compare the displacements undergone by the bones of the left versus right wrist in the same individual, and between bones of the wrists of men and women, during the performance of the coordinated RUD maneuver. Our results show that the complex displacements of the wrist bones during RUD can be modeled with high reliability with just 5 basis functions, that captured over 91% of variation across individuals. The basis functions were able to predict intermediate wrist bone poses with an overall high accuracy (mean error of 0.26 mm). Our proposed approach found statistically significant differences between bone displacement trajectories in women versus men, however, did not find significant differences in those of the left versus right wrist in the same individual. Our proposed method has the potential to enable detailed analysis of wrist kinematics for each sex, and provide a robust framework for characterizing the normal and pathologic displacement of the wrist bones, such as in the context of wrist instability.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, even subject-specific muscle-tendon MAs vary across contraction levels and are impossible to determine at high contraction levels without techniques that use ionized radiation. Therefore, different generic MA functions are often used to estimate in vivo muscle forces, which may alter force predictions and the shape of the muscle's force-length relationship. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of different literature-based patella tendon MA functions on the vastus lateralis (VL) force-angle relationship. Participants (n = 11) performed maximum voluntary isometric knee extension contractions at six knee flexion angles, ranging from 40° to 90°. To estimate in vivo VL muscle force, the peak knee extension torque at each joint angle was multiplied by the VL's physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) relative to the quadriceps' PCSA (34%) and then divided by the angle-specific patella tendon MA for 19 different functions. Maximum VL force was significantly different across MA functions (p ≤ 0.039) and occurred at different knee flexion angles. The shape of the VL force-angle relationship also differed significantly (p < 0.01) across MA functions. According to the maximum force generated by VL based on its literature-derived PSCA, only the VL force-angle relationships estimated using geometric imaging-based MA functions are feasible across the knee angles studied here. We therefore recommend that an average of these MA functions is calculated to estimate quadriceps muscle forces if subject-specific MAs cannot be determined.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recent studies have shown that Synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-microCT) can improve the accuracy and precision of DVC. However, only zero-strain or virtually-moved test have been used to quantify the DVC uncertainties, leading to potential underestimation of the measurement errors. In this study, for the first time, the uncertainties of a global DVC approach have been evaluated on repeated SR-microCT scans of bovine cortical bone (voxel size: 1.6 μm), which were virtually deformed for different magnitudes and along different directions. The results showed that systematic and random errors of the normal strain components along the deformation direction were higher than the errors along unstrained directions. The systematic percentage errors were smaller for larger virtual deformations. The random percentage error was in the order of 10% of the virtual deformation. However, higher errors were localized at the boundary of the volumes of interest, perpendicular to the deformation direction. When only the central region of the samples was considered (100 µm layers removed from the borders where the deformation was applied), the errors in the direction of virtual deformation were comparable to the errors in the unstrained directions. In conclusion, the method presented to estimate the uncertainties of DVC is suitable for testing anisotropic specimens as cortical bone. The good agreement between the uncertainties in measurements of strain components obtained with this approach and with the simpler zero-strain-test suggests that the latter is adequate in the tested deformation scenarios.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, measuring anatomically meaningful segment and joint kinematics requires virtual alignment of the MIMU frame with the anatomical frame of its corresponding segment. Therefore, this paper presents a simple calibration procedure, based on MIMU readouts, to align the inertial frame of the MIMU with the anatomical frames, as recommended by ISB. The proposed calibration includes five seconds of quiet standing in a neutral posture followed by ten consecutive hip flexions/extensions. This procedure will independently calibrate MIMUs attached to the pelvis, thigh, shank, and foot. The accuracy and repeatability of the calibration procedure and the 3D joint angle estimation were validated against the gold standard motion capture system by an experimental study with ten able-bodied participants. The procedure showed high test-retest repeatability in aligning the MIMU frame with its corresponding anatomical frame, i.e., the helical angle between the MIMU and anatomical frames did not significantly differ between the test and retest sessions (except for thigh MIMU). Compared to previously introduced procedures, this procedure attained the highest inter-participant repeatability (inter-participant coefficient of variations of the helical angle: 20.5-42.2%). Further, the proposed calibration would reduce the offset errors of the 3D joint angle estimation (up to 12.8 degrees on average) compared to joint angle estimation without calibration (up to 26.3 degrees on average).

Studying PL function has been limited by previous electromyography (EMG) studies reporting poor between-day reliability. Due to its close proximity to adjacent muscles, EMG measures of PL may be susceptible to crosstalk, thus correct electrode placement is vital. The aim of this study was to use ultrasound to aid placement of small surface EMG electrodes and determine the between-day reliability of PL EMG in healthy participants' walking. Ten participants walked barefoot and shod at a controlled, self-selected speed. Six trials per condition, per session, were recorded over two days (mean (SD): 5 (3) days apart). The muscle belly was located using ultrasound. EMG was recorded with surface electrodes (Trigno™ Mini, Delsys, Inc.) at 2000 Hz. Amplitude was normalized to the peak per gait cycle and time normalized to the gait cycle. Reliability of discrete variables were primarily assessed with the standard error of measurement (SEM), plus the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC), the coefficient of variation (CV) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The pattern of the EMG profile was consistent. The SEM of peak amplitude was 4% (3-8%) and 3% (2-5%) for barefoot and shod respectively. For timing of the peak the SEM was 2% (1-3%) and 1% (1-2%) for barefoot and shod respectively. Low SEM of discrete variables suggests good reliability of PL EMG during walking supporting the future use of this protocol.

A planar 8-segment torque-driven simulation model combined with a springboard model was used to investigate optimum takeoff technique for maximising rotation in forward dives from the one metre springboard. Optimisations were run by varying the torque activation parameters to maximise forward rotation potential (angular momentum × flight time) while allowing for movement constraints, anatomical constraints, and execution variability. With a constraint to ensure realistic board clearance and anatomical constraints to prevent joint hyperextension, the optimised simulation produced 24% more rotation potential than a simulation matching a 2½ somersault piked dive. When 2 ms perturbations to the torque onset timings were included for the ankle, knee and hip torques within the optimisation process, the model was only able to produce 87% of the rotation potential achieved in the matching simulation. This implies that a pre-planned technique cannot produce a sufficiently good takeoff and that adjustments must be made during takeoff. When the initial onset timings of the torque generators were unperturbed and 10 ms perturbations were introduced into the torque onset timings in the board recoil phase, the optimisation produced 8% more rotation potential than the matching simulation. The optimised simulation had more hip flexion and less shoulder extension at takeoff than the matching simulation.

In this study, we propose a design of experiment method (DOE) to study the parameter sensitivity while minimizing the number of tests. A Box-Behnken design was then implemented to study the influence of strain rate, preconditioning and preloading conditions on visco-hyperelastic mechanical parameters of two rat forearm muscles. The results show that the strain rate affects the visco-hyperelastic parameters for both muscles. These results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that stiffness and viscoelastic contributions increase with strain rate. Thus, DOE has been shown to be a valid method to determine the effect of the experimental conditions on the mechanical behaviour of biological tissues such as skeletal muscle. This method considerably reduces the number of experiments. Indeed, the presented study using 3 parameters at 3 levels would have required at least 54 tests per muscle against 14 for the proposed DOE method.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Models of shear-thinning complex fluids, dating from the work of Bird, Carreau, Cross and Yasuda, have been applied in highly-cited computational studies of hemodynamics for several decades. In this manuscript we revisit these models, first to highlight a degree of uncertainty in the naming conventions in the literature, but more importantly to address the problem of inferring model parameters by fitting to rheology experiments. By refitting published data, and also by simulation, we find large, flat regions in likelihood surfaces that yield families of parameter sets which fit the data equally well. Despite having almost indistinguishable fits to experimental data these varying parameter sets can predict very different flow profiles, and as such these parameters cannot be used to draw conclusions about physical properties of the fluids, such as zero-shear viscosity or relaxation time of the fluid, or indeed flow behaviours. We verify that these features are not a consequence of the experimental data sets through simulations; by sampling points from the rheological models and adding a small amount of noise we create a synthetic data set which reveals that the problem of parameter identifiability is intrinsic to these models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Studies have linked fatigue loading with various mechanical, structural, and biological changes associated with pathology. However, the multiscale progression of damage accumulation with respect to area, severity and the distinct contributions of strain level and number of cycles has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate multiscale mechanisms underlying fatigue damage accumulation and their effect on the cellular environment. Using an in situ model in rat tail tendon (RTT), fatigue loading was applied at various strains and cycle numbers to induce fatigue damage. Pre- and post- fatigue diagnostic mechanical testing, second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging were used to investigate extracellular and cellular damage modes at multiple scales. Fatigue loading at strains at or below 1.0% resulted in no significant changes in SHG damage area or severity and no changes in collagen fibril or cell morphology compared with controls. Fatigue loading at strains above 1.5% resulted in greater mechanical changes correlated with increased damage area measured by SHG and collagenous damage observed by TEM. Increased cycles at high strain further altered mechanical properties, increased structural damage severity (but not area), and altered TEM collagen rupture patterns. Cell morphology was similarly progressively affected with increased strain and cycle number. These damage mechanisms that may trigger degenerative changes characteristic of tendinopathy could be targeted as a part of prevention or therapy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the causal effects of muscle-tendon structure on joint function have not been tested in a controlled setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the implications of muscle-tendon unit parameters on simulated single-leg heel raise height. We hypothesized that muscle fiber length and resting ankle angle - a clinical surrogate measure of tendon slack length - would predict single-leg heel raise height more strongly than other parameters. To test this hypothesis, we developed a two-part simulation paradigm that recreated clinically relevant muscle-tendon scenarios and then tested these parameters on single-leg heel raise height. We found that longer muscle fibers had the greatest positive effect on single-leg heel raise height. However, tendon slack length, determined by simulating resting ankle angles in a secondary analysis, revealed a stronger negative correlation with heel raise height. Our findings support previous clinical observations that both muscle fascicle length and resting tendon length are important muscle-tendon parameters for patient function.

Specific aims were to investigate whether weakened knee joint stabilizers cause abnormal kinematics and how it influences the knee joint kinetic (i.e., power) in response to perturbation. Patient-specific musculoskeletal models were simulated with experimental gait data from six TKA patients (baseline models). Muscle strength and ligament force parameter were reduced by up to 30% to simulate weak knee joint stabilizers (weak models). Two different muscle recruitment criteria were tested to examine whether altered muscle recruitment pattern can mask the influence of weakened stabilizers on the knee joint kinematics and kinetics. Level-walking knee joint kinematics and kinetics were calculated though force-dependent kinematic and inverse dynamic analyses. Bode analysis was then recruited to estimate the knee joint power in response to a simulated perturbation. Weak models resulted in larger anterior-posterior (A-P) displacement and internal-external (I-E) rotation compared to baseline (I-E: 18.4 ± 8.5 vs. 11.6 ± 5.7 (deg), A-P: 9.7 ± 5.6 vs. 5.5 ± 4.1 (mm)). Changes in muscle recruitment criterion however altered the results such that A-P and I-E were not notably different from baseline models. In response to the simulated perturbation, weak models versus baseline models generated a delayed power response with unbounded magnitudes. Perturbed power behavior of the knee remained unaltered regardless of the muscle recruitment criteria.

Although UCM-derived measures are thought to depend on the number of data points analyzed, the minimum number needed to reasonably approximate true values of these measures is unknown. For each of two performance variables related to mechanical stability of gait, we evaluated changes in UCM-derived measures when increasing the number of analyzed points, here steps. Fourteen older adults walked on a treadmill while motion capture tracked movement. For each subject, n steps (where n = 2-99) were randomly sampled from the first 100, then used to calculate UCM-derived variables. For each subject, variables were expressed as a percent of the subject-specific value with n = 100 and averaged across 50 simulations. For each n, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from group data. The minimum number of steps to ""reasonably approximate"" a variables was defined as the value of n for which the lower CI was >90% of the value with n = 100. Regardless of performance variable, reasonable approximations of the synergy index were attained with n = 16 steps, whereas n = 50 steps were needed for each of the variance components However, the differences between using 16 steps and 50 steps were small.

Regenerative medicine offers promising alternative treatments, but there is little understanding of the correlation between magnitude of VML injuries and corresponding functional deficits that must be addressed. There is a need for a tool that can elucidate the relationship between VML injury and force loss, as well as the impact on specific mechanisms responsible for force production. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel coupled framework of in situ and in silico methods to more precisely understand the relationship between injury location and force production deficits. We created a three-dimensional finite-element model of the pennate latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle in the rat and validated the model experimentally. We found that the model's prediction (2.6 N/g Model I, 2.1 N/g Model V) compared favorably to in situ testing of isometric force generation of the injured rat LD muscle (2.8 ± 0.3 N/g Experimental I, 2.0 ± 0.2 N/g Experimental V). Further model analysis revealed that the contribution from lateral and longitudinal force transmission to the total force varied with injury location and led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for VML-related force deficits. In the future, the coupled computational and experimental framework can be used to inform development of preclinical VML injury models that better recapitulate the spectrum of VML injuries observed in affected patients, and the mechanistic insight can accelerate the creation of improved regenerative therapeutics for VML injuries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Toe flexor strength and electromyography activity of the foot muscles were measured in 12 healthy men at 6 different ankle joint angles with the knee joint at 90 deg in the sitting position. To measure the maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles, subjects exerted maximum force on a toe grip dynamometer while the activity levels of the intrinsic and extrinsic plantar muscles were measured. The relation between ankle joint angle and maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles was determined, and the isometric force exhibited a peak when the ankle joint was at 70-90 deg on average. From this optimal neutral position, the isometric force gradually decreased and reached its nadir in the plantar flexion position (i.e., 120 deg). The EMG activity of the abductor hallucis (intrinsic plantar muscle) and peroneus longus (extrinsic plantar muscle) did not differ at any ankle joint angles. The results of this study suggest that the force generation of toe flexor muscles is regulated at the ankle joint and that changes in the length-tension relations of the extrinsic plantar muscle could be a reason for the force-generating capacity at the metatarsophalangeal joint when the ankle joint angle is changed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study the influence of surrounding tissues including the presence of the spine on wall stress analysis and mechanical characterization of abdominal aortic aneurysms using ultrasound imaging has been investigated.


METHODS
Geometries of 7 AAA patients and 11 healthy volunteers were acquired using 3-D ultrasound and converted to finite element based models. Model complexity of externally unsupported (aorta-only) models was complemented with inclusion of both soft tissue around the aorta and a spine support dorsal to the aorta. Computed 3-D motion of the aortic wall was verified by means of ultrasound speckle tracking. Resulting stress, strain, and estimated shear moduli were analyzed to quantify the effect of adding surrounding material supports.


RESULTS
An improved agreement was shown between the ultrasound measurements and the finite element tissue and spine models compared to the aorta-only models. Peak and 99-percentile Von Mises stress showed an overall decrease of 23-30%, while estimated shear modulus decreased with 12-20% after addition of the soft tissue. Shear strains in the aortic wall were higher in areas close to the spine compared to the anterior region.


CONCLUSIONS
Improving model complexity with surrounding tissue and spine showed a homogenization of wall stresses, reduction in homogeneity of shear strain at the posterior side of the AAA, and a decrease in estimated aortic wall shear modulus. Future research will focus on the importance of a patient-specific spine geometry and location.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The musculoskeletal task, joint and muscle stiffness are regulated by the central nervous system towards improving stability and interaction with the environment during movement. Many pathological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, result in increased rigidity due to elevated muscle tone in antagonist muscle pairs, therefore the stiffness is an important quantity that can provide valuable information during the analysis phase. Musculoskeletal redundancy poses significant challenges in obtaining accurate stiffness results without introducing critical modeling assumptions. Currently, model-based estimation of stiffness relies on some objective criterion to deal with muscle redundancy, which, however, cannot be assumed to hold in every context. To alleviate this source of error, our approach explores the entire space of possible solutions that satisfy the action and the physiological muscle constraints. Using the notion of null space, the proposed framework rigorously accounts for the effect of muscle redundancy in the computation of the feasible stiffness characteristics. To confirm this, comprehensive case studies on hand movement and gait are provided, where the feasible endpoint and joint stiffness is evaluated. Notably, this process enables the estimation of stiffness distribution over the range of motion and aids in further investigation of factors affecting the capacity of the system to modulate its stiffness. Such knowledge can significantly improve modeling by providing a holistic overview of dynamic quantities related to the human musculoskeletal system, despite its inherent redundancy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the effectiveness of TEVAR in the treatment of TAA is often limited due to the complex anatomy of aortic arch. Flow preservation at the three supra-aortic branches further increases the overall technical difficulty. This study proposes a novel stent graft design with slit perforations that can positively alter the hemodynamics at the aortic arch while maintaining blood flow to supra-aortic branches. We carried out a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis to evaluate flow characteristics near stented aortic arch in simplified TAA models, followed by in-vitro experiments using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a mock circulatory loop. The hemodynamics result was studied in terms of time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillating shear index (OSI), and endothelial cell action potential (ECAP). The results showed that the stent graft with slit perforations can reduce the disturbed flow region considerably. Furthermore, the effect of the slits on flow preservation to the supra-aortic branches was simulated and compared with experimental results. The effectiveness of the stent graft with slit perforations in preserving flow to the branches was demonstrated by both simulated and experimental results. Low TAWSS and elevated ECAP were observed in the aortic arch aneurysm after the placement of the stent graft with slits, implying the potential of thrombus formation in the aneurysm. On the other hand, the effects of the stent grafts with full-slit design and half-slit design on the shear stress did not differ significantly. The present analysis indicated that not only could the stent graft with slit perforations shield the aneurysm from rupture, but also it resulted in a favorable environment for thrombus that can contribute to the shrinkage of the aneurysm.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These flow characteristics are today frequently detected at various anatomical, lesion and intervention-related sites, while their role as a pathological determinant is less understood. To present-day, numerous WSS-based descriptors have been proposed to characterize the spatiotemporal nature of the WSS disturbances, however, without differentiation between physiological laminar oscillations and turbulence-related WSS (tWSS) fluctuations. Also, much attention has been focused on magnetic resonance (MR) WSS estimations, so far with limited success; promoting the need of a near-wall surrogate marker. In this study, a new approach is explored to characterize the tWSS, by taking advantage of the tensor characteristics of the fluctuating WSS correlations, providing both a magnitude and an anisotropy measure of the disturbances. These parameters were studied in two patient-specific coarctation models (sever and mild), using large eddy simulations, and correlated against near-wall reciprocal Reynolds stress parameters. Collectively, results showed distinct regions of differing tWSS characteristics, features which were sensitive to changes in flow conditions. Generally, the post-stenotic tWSS was governed by near axisymmetric fluctuations, findings that where not consistent with conventional WSS disturbance predictors. At the 2-3 mm wall-offset range, a strong linear correlation was found between tWSS magnitude and near-wall turbulence kinetic energy (TKE), in contrast to the anisotropy indices, suggesting that MR-measured TKE can be used to assess elevated tWSS regions while tWSS anisotropy estimates request well-resolved simulation methods.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous literature investigated the ankle kinematics on ex vivo data sets, but little has been reported for natural walking, and even less for pathological and juvenile populations. This paper proposes an MRI-based morphological fitting methodology for the personalised definition of the tibiotalar and the subtalar joint axes during gait, and investigated its application to characterise the ankle kinematics in twenty patients affected by Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). The estimated joint axes were in line with in vivo and ex vivo literature data and joint kinematics variation subsequent to inter-operator variability was in the order of 1°. The model allowed to investigate, for the first time in patients with JIA, the functional response to joint impairment. The joint kinematics highlighted changes over time that were consistent with changes in the patient's clinical pattern and notably varied from patient to patient. The heterogeneous and patient-specific nature of the effects of JIA was confirmed by the absence of a correlation between a semi-quantitative MRI-based impairment score and a variety of investigated joint kinematics indexes. In conclusion, this study showed the feasibility of using MRI and morphological fitting to identify the tibiotalar and subtalar joint axes in a non-invasive patient-specific manner.

Not considering morphology as a model parameter limits the predictive capabilities for applications in personalized medicine, a growing trend in modern clinical practice. The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of variations in spinal morphology on the flexion-extension responses, utilizing mesh-morphing-based parametrization and metamodel-based sensitivity analysis. A C5-C6 segment was used as the baseline model. Variations of intervertebral disc height, facet joint slope, facet joint articular processes height, vertebral body anterior-posterior depth, and segment size were parametrized. In addition, material property variations of ligaments were considered for sensitivity analysis. The influence of these variations on vertebral rotation and forces in the ligaments were analyzed. The disc height, segmental size, and body depth were found to be the most influential (in the cited order) morphology variations; while among the ligament material property variations, capsular ligament and ligamentum flavum influenced vertebral rotation the most. Changes in disc height influenced forces in the posterior ligaments, indicating that changes in the anterior load-bearing column of the spine could have consequences on the posterior column. A method to identify influential morphology variations is presented in this work, which will help automation efforts in modeling to focus on variations that matter.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of subscapularis muscle loading on contact area and contact pressure between the subscapularis and AIGHL-LC and between the glenoid bone and the AIGHL-LC following Bankart repair. Twenty-two fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. They were attached to a shoulder-positioning device to which a compression force was applied. Loads applied to the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons were held constant. The loads applied to the subscapularis tendon were set at 0, 10, 20, and 30 Newton (N). Contact pressure and area between the subscapularis and the AIGHL-LC were measured with the arm at 4 rotational positions: 60° and 30° internal, neutral, and 30° external. After the Bankart lesion was created, the contact area and pressure between the AIGHL-LC and glenoid bone were measured while Bankart repair was performed with or without loading of the subscapularis. The contact area and pressures with 10, 20, and 30 N of subscapularis loadings were significantly greater than with 0 N of subscapularis loading at 60° internal rotation and 30° external rotation (P < .05). After Bankart repair, contact area and pressure with subscapularis loading between the AIGHL-LC and glenoid bone were significantly greater than without subscapularis loading (P < .01).

Motion analysis on ultrasound images allows us to non-invasively study the (relative) movement of carpal tunnel structures and recently a speckle tracking method using singular value decomposition (SVD) has been proposed to optimize this tracking. This study aims to assess the reliability of longitudinal speckle tracking with SVD in both healthy volunteers and patients with CTS. Images from sixteen healthy volunteers and twenty-two CTS patients were used. Ultrasound clips of the third superficial flexor tendon and surrounding subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) were acquired during finger flexion-extension. A custom made tracking algorithm was used for the analysis. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated using a single measure, two-way random model with absolute agreement and Bland-Altman plots were added for graphical representation. ICC values varied between 0.73 and 0.95 in the control group and 0.66-0.98 in the CTS patients, with the majority of the results classified as good to excellent. Tendon tracking showed higher reliability values compared to the SSCT, but values between the control and CTS groups were comparable. Speckle tracking with SVD can reliably be used to analyze longitudinal movement of anatomical structures with different sizes and compositions within the context of the carpal tunnel in both a healthy as well as a pathological state.

Recent results also showed that under fall-like loading, cortical bone fracture toughness is similar at different anatomical locations in the same donor. While cortical bone toughening mechanisms are known to be dependent on the tissue architecture under quasi-static loading, the fracture mechanisms during a fall are less studied. In the current study, the structural parameters of eight paired femoral diaphyses, femoral necks and radial diaphyses were mechanically tested under quasi-static and fall-like loading conditions (female donors, 70 ± 14 y.o., [50-91 y.o.]). Synchrotron radiation micro-CT imaging was used to quantify the amount of micro-cracks formed during loading. The volume fraction of these micro-cracks was significantly higher within the specimens loaded under a quasi-static condition than under a loading representative of a fall.

However, the mucociliary clearance poses a challenge in gaining high efficacy of intranasal drug delivery because cilia continuously carry the mucus blanket towards the laryngeal region. To better understand mucus flow behaviour on the human nasal cavity wall, we present computational model development, and evaluation of mucus motion on a realistic nasal cavity model reconstructed from CT-scans. The model development involved two approaches based on the actual nasal cavity geometry namely: (i) unwrapped-surface model in 2D domain and (ii) 3D-shell model. Conservation equations of fluid motion were applied to the domains, where a mucus production source term was used to initiate the mucus motion. The analysis included mucus flow patterns, virtual saccharin tests and quantitative velocity magnitude analysis, which demonstrated that the 3D-shell model results provided better agreement with experimental data. The unwrapped-surface model also suffered from mesh-deformations during the unwrapping stage and this led to higher mucus velocity compared to experimental data. Therefore, the 3D-shell model was recommended for future mucus flow simulations. As a first step towards mucus motion modelling this study provides important information that accurately simulates a mucus velocity field on a human nasal cavity wall, for assessment of toxicology and efficacy of intranasal drug delivery.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thus, limited hamstring flexibility may be related to large amounts of spine flexion in ""slumped"" sitting postures which could contribute to low back pain and injury. The aim of this study was to determine if hamstring and pelvic flexibility are associated with flexed sitting postures using a backless office chair. Forty-one healthy female adults aged 18-69  years were recruited. Subjects performed the Sit-and-Reach test to determine maximum flexibility values and lumbar and pelvic angles were measured with accelerometers. Participants then completed a standardized typing task for a 10-minute sitting trial at an ergonomically adjusted workstation. The results showed no association between hamstring flexibility and seated lumbar spine and pelvic angles (p = 0.999, η2 = 0.000; p = 0.901, η2 = 0.006). Greater pelvic flexibility was associated with a more upright lumbar sitting posture (p = 0.023; η2 = 0.132) but with no specific pelvic sitting posture (p = 0.660; η2 = 0.005). Different movement strategies during the Sit-and-Reach test were detected: all participants moved through their lumbar spine; but only those with 'excellent' flexibility also used their pelvis. Individuals in the 'excellent' flexibility group were significantly shorter than those with 'poor' and 'good' flexibility (p = 0.020; η2 = 0.190). In conclusion, hamstring flexibility does not influence sitting posture but pelvic flexibility does. Other factors such as acetabulofemoral joint limitations, consciousness of posture, or the seat itself may also influence sitting posture.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how arm posture influences shoulder dynamics while generating pushing or pulling torques in the horizontal plane. Sixteen healthy participants were examined in seven postures encompassing a large workspace of the shoulder. At each posture, the participant's shoulder was rapidly perturbed while measuring the resultant change in shoulder torque about the glenohumeral axis. Participants were examined both at rest and while producing horizontal flexion and extension torques scaled to 15% of a maximum voluntary contraction. Shoulder stiffness, viscosity, and damping ratio were estimated using impedance-based matching, and changes in these outcome measures with torque level, elevation angle, and plane of elevation angle were explored with a linear mixed effects model. Shoulder stiffness was found to decrease with increasing elevation angles (p < 0.001) without subsequent changes in viscosity, leading to a greater damping ratios at higher elevation angles (p < 0.001). Shoulder stiffness, viscosity, and damping ratio (all p < 0.05) were all found to significantly increase as the plane of elevation of the arm was increased.

The classification process was based on measurements from a single wearable sensor using a total of 41,780 strides from eleven recreational runners while running in real-world and uncontrolled environment. Biomechanical variables included pelvic drop, ground contact time, braking, vertical oscillation of pelvis, pelvic rotation, and cadence were recorded during running on three inclination grades: downhill, -2° to -7°; level, -0.2° to +0.2°; and uphill, +2° to +7°. An ensemble and non-linear machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), was used to classify inclination condition and determine the importance of each of the biomechanical variables. Classification accuracy was determined for subject-specific and group-based RF models. The mean classification accuracy of all subject-specific RF models was 86.29%, while group-based classification accuracy was 76.17%. Braking was identified as the most important variable for all the runners using the group-based model and for most of the runners based on a subject-specific models. In addition, individual runners used different strategies across different inclination conditions and the ranked order of variable importance was unique for each runner. These results demonstrate that subject-specific models can better characterize changes in gait biomechanical patterns compared to a more traditional group-based approach.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Sigmoid sinus (SS) venous sound is widely suggested to be a possible sound source of PT. The dehiscence and thinness of SS cortical plate (CP) was commonly reported as PT pathology in previous studies, but lack quantitative or biomechanical analysis. In this study, it was aimed to quantify the relationship between venous sound and CP dehiscence/thinness using in vitro experiment. The in vitro models of SS and CP were established based on 3D-printing, with the developed pulsatile venous flow in the SS model. The generated sound signal and the vibration response at the dehiscent/thinned area were analyzed. The sound signal generated in the normal-sized dehiscence model was pulse-synchronous within 100--400 Hz, which had similar acoustic characteristics as the clinical PT sounds. It was concluded that the pulsatile venous sound is produced at TS-SS junction in case of CP dehiscence. The CP, even a thinned one can effectively diminish the venous sound and sound-generating pulsatile vibration at TS-SS junction. The CP dehiscence would induce pulse-synchronous and high pressure venous sound, as well as pulse-synchronous vibration above 20 Hz, regardless of the dehiscence size. On the contrary, the CP thinness would not induce obvious venous sound or pulsatile vibration above 20 Hz.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Like other biomechanical models, MSFMs represent the leg and foot as a series of linked rigid segments, but such a simplification may not be appropriate, particularly for the flexible forefoot. This study investigated the appropriateness of the rigid body assumption on marker clusters used to define the individual segments (tibia, hindfoot, forefoot) of a widely-used MSFM. Rigidity of the marker clusters was quantified using the rigid body error (σRBE) calculated for each frame of a representative gait cycle for 64 normal healthy adults who underwent gait analysis. σRBE is a measure of how well the tracking marker configuration at each frame compares to the arrangement of the same markers in a reference pose. As expected, the patterns of deformation of the three marker clusters differed over the gait cycle. The hindfoot cluster remained relatively undeformed in comparison to the forefoot and tibia clusters. The largest deformations of the forefoot cluster occurred near the beginning and end of the stance phase. The tibia cluster deformed throughout the entire gait cycle, with a pattern similar to that of a typical knee flexion angle graph. The results raise questions about the appropriateness of the rigid-body assumption when applied to MSFMs, particularly in the forefoot region.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this framework, the present work describes an efficient computational model for the evaluation of the ventricular flow alteration in presence of mitral valve stenosis. The model is based on the direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations two-way coupled with a structural solver for the left ventricle and mitral valve dynamics. The presence of mitral valve stenosis is mimicked by a single-parameter constraint acting on the kinematics of the mitral leaflets. Four different degrees of mitral valve stenosis are considered focusing on the hemodynamic alterations occurring in pathologic conditions. The mitral jet, generated during diastole, is seen to shrink and strengthen when the stenosis gets more severe. As a consequence, the kinetic energy of the flow, the tissues shear stresses, the transvalvular pressure drop and mitral regurgitation increase. It results that, as the stenosis severity level increases, the geometric and effective orifice areas decrease up to 50% with respect the normal case due to the reduced leaflets mobility and stronger blood acceleration during the diastolic phase. The modified intraventricular hemodynamics is also related to a stronger pressure gradient that, for severe stenosis, can be more than ten times larger than the healthy valve case. These computational results are fully consistent with the available clinical literature and open the way to the virtual assessment of surgical procedures and to the evaluation of prosthetic devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A mathematical perspective.","Accurate determination of joint axes is essential for understanding musculoskeletal function. Whilst numerous algorithms to compute such axes exist, the conditions under which each of the methods performs best remain largely unknown. Typically, algorithms are evaluated for specific conditions only limiting the external validity of conclusions regarding their performance. We derive exact mathematical relationships between three commonly used algorithms for computing joint axes from motion data: finite helical axes (FHA), instantaneous helical axes (IHA) and SARA (symmetrical axis of rotation approach), including relationships for an extension to the mean helical axes methods that facilitate determining joint centres and axes. Through the derivation of a sound mathematical framework to objectively compare the algorithms we demonstrate that the FHA and SARA approach are equivalent for the analysis of two time frames. Moreover, we show that the position of a helical axis derived from the IHA using positional data is affected by a systematic error perpendicular to the true axis direction, whereas the axis direction is identical to those computed with either the FHA or SARA approach (true direction). Finally, with an appropriate choice of weighting factors the mean FHA (MFHA) method is equivalent to the Symmetrical Centre of Rotation Estimation (SCoRE) algorithm for determination of a Centre of Rotation (CoR), and similarly, equivalent to the SARA algorithm for determination of an Axis of Rotation (AoR).

Although cell motions in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers have been studied previously, three-dimensional (3D) collective cell migration, which constantly occurs during embryogenesis such as the establishment of ducts and acini in vivo, remains elusive. In this paper, we develop a cell-based model incorporating cell mechanics and cell motility to address coherent cell motions in a spherical acinus-like lumen with different cell populations. It is found that the interplays between cell persistence, random fluctuation, and geometrical confinement may engender rich and novel migratory modes. In a 3D spherical lumen, two cells may undergo stripe-like or cross-circular coherent rotations, whereas multiple cells can form dynamic twisting or circulating bands, leaving sparse cells at the center or even a hollow cavity in the cell aggregate. The cell density is found to profoundly influence the collective cell migration modes.

However, the effects of the compression on contraction dynamics in humans are not well examined. The aim of the study was to quantify the alterations of contraction dynamics and muscle architecture in human muscle with external transverse loads. The posterior tibialis nerve of 29 subjects was stimulated to obtain the maximal double-twitch force of the gastrocnemius muscle with and without transverse compression that was generated using an indentor. The muscle architecture was determined by a sonographic probe that was embedded within the indentor. Five stimulations each were conducted at 5 conditions: (1) pretest (unloaded), (2) indentor loading with 2 kg, (3) 4.5 kg, (4) 10 kg, and (5) posttest (unloaded). Compared to the pretest maximal force decreased by 9%, 13% and 16% for 2 kg, 4.5 kg and 10 kg, respectively. The half-relaxation time increased with increased transverse load whereas the rate of force development decreased from pretest to 2 kg and from 4.5 kg to 10 kg. The lifting height of the indentor increased with transverse load from 2 kg to 4.5 kg but decreased from 4.5 kg to 10 kg. Increases in pennation during the twitches were reduced at the highest transverse load. The results demonstrate changes of the contraction dynamics due to transversal muscle loading.

Sixteen healthy adults ran on a treadmill at a standard speed of 2.7 m/s. The VO of their running gait was simultaneously collected from raw depth data (Microsoft Kinect v2) and 3D marker data (Vicon multi-camera motion capture system). The agreement between the VO measures obtained from the two systems was assessed using a Bland-Altman plot with 95% limits of agreement (LOA), a Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rc). The depth data from the Kinect v2 demonstrated excellent results across all measures of validity (r = 0.97; rc = 0.97; 95% LOA = -8.0 mm - 8.7 mm), with an average absolute error and percent error of 3.7 (2.1) mm and 4.0 (2.0)%, respectively.

A probabilistic finite element model study.,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is one major source of low back pain, which because of its complex multifactorial nature renders the treatment challenging and thus necessitates extensive research. Experimental animal models have proven valuable in improving our understanding of degenerative processes and potentially promising therapies. Currently, the sheep is the most frequently used large animal in vivo model in intervertebral disc research. However, despite its undoubted value for investigations of the complex biological and cellular aspects, to date, it is unclear whether the sheep is also suited to study the mechanical aspects of disc degeneration in humans. A parametric finite element (FE) model of the L4-5 spinal motion segment was developed. Using this model, the geometry and the material properties of both the human and the ovine spinal segment as well as different appearances of disc degeneration can be depicted. Under pure and combined loads, it was investigated whether degenerative changes to both the human and the ovine model equivalent caused the same mechanical response. Different patterns of degeneration resulted in large variations in the ranges of motion, intradiscal pressure, ligament and facet loads. In the human, but not in the ovine model, all these results differed significantly between different degrees of degeneration.

To measure large muscles like the vastus lateralis (VL) in one sequence, scanners with a large field of view (FOV) and a high flux density are needed. However, large scanners are expensive and not always available. The purpose of the current study was to develop a marker-based approach to reconstruct the VL from several separate MRI sequences, acquired with a low-field MRI scanner. The VL muscle of 21 volunteers was marked at one-third and two-third of thigh length using fish oil capsules. Three consecutive MRI sequences (i.e. proximal, medial and distal part) of the thigh were captured between the markers and the muscle insertion and origin. After a manual segmentation of the VL the muscle was reconstructed using the developed approach. The muscle volume, maximal anatomical cross-sectional area and length were 715.1 ± 93.4 cm3, 34.0 ± 4.0 cm2 and 34.4 ± 2.2 cm respectively. The procedure showed an average error between 0.9% and 2.2% for the reconstructed muscle volume, the averaged RMSD between the cross-sectional areas of two overlapping sequences were between 0.80 ± 0.71 cm2 and 0.88 ± 0.78 cm2. The proposed approach provides an appropriate accuracy for muscle volume assessment, as the estimated error for muscle volume calculation was quite small. The reconstruction quality depends mainly on the proper marker attachment and identification, as well as the spatial resolution of the image sequences.

Physicians decide the best treatment based on their experience, so the process is entirely subjective. A better understanding of soft tissue stress and its contribution in supporting the plantar arch could help to guide the clinical decision. Traditional experimental trials cannot consistently evaluate the contribution of each tissue. Therefore, in this research a 3-Dimensional FE foot model was reconstructed from a normal patient in order to measure the stress of the passive stabilizers of the arch, and its variation in different scenarios related with intermediate stages of AAFD development. All bones, the plantar fascia (PF), cartilages, plantar ligaments and the spring ligament (SL) were included, respecting their anatomical distribution and biomechanical characteristics. An AAFD evaluation scenario was simulated. The relative contribution of each tissue was obtained comparing each result with a normal case. The results show that PF is the main tissue that prevents the arch elongation, while SL mainly reduces the foot pronation. Long and short plantar ligaments play a secondary role in this process. The stress increment on both PF and SL when one of two fails suggests that these tissues complement each other. These findings support the theory that regards the tibialis posterior tendon as a secondary actor in the arch maintenance, compared with the PF and the SL, because this tendon is overstretched by the hindfoot pronation around the talonavicular joint. This approach could help to improve the understanding of AAFD.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ankle intrinsic stiffness, which quantifies the joint intrinsic properties, has been usually assumed constant in standing; however, there is strong evidence that it is highly dependent on the joint torque, which changes significantly with sway in stance. In this study, we examined how ankle intrinsic stiffness changes with postural sway during standing. Ten subjects stood on a standing apparatus, while subjected to pulse perturbations of ankle position. The mean torque of a short period before the start of each pulse was used as a measure of background torque. Responses with similar background torques were grouped together and used to estimate the parameters of an intrinsic stiffness model. Stiffness estimates were normalized to the critical stiffness and the background torque was transformed to the center of pressure location. We found that in most subjects, the normalized stiffness increased linearly with the movement of center of pressure towards the toes, with an average slope of 2.11 ± 0.80 1/m·rad. This modulation of ankle intrinsic stiffness seems functionally appropriate, since the intrinsic stiffness increases quickly, as the center of pressure moves toward the toes and the limits of stability.

Ankle braces are used to reduce ankle inversion, while allowing normal plantar and dorsiflexion ranges of motion. Knee injuries, such as anterior cruciate ligament injuries, are also common in dynamic movements. It is important to understand how ankle braces affect injury risk at other proximal joints. There is limited and conflicting results on how ankle braces affect knee mechanics during these types of movements. Additionally, it is unknown if sex differences exist when using an ankle brace. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a hinged ankle brace and sex during a 45° cutting movement. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected using a motion capture system and force plate on ten men and eight women during cutting trials. 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVAs were used to detect differences in ground reaction forces, as well as knee and ankle kinematics between brace conditions and sex (p < 0.05). The brace condition exhibited greater initial contact ankle dorsiflexion (p = 0.011), decreased peak ankle inversion (p < 0.01), and increased vertical loading rate (p = 0.040). Females performed the cutting movement with less initial contact (p = 0.019) and peak knee flexion (p = 0.023) compared to males. Ankle bracing had no impact on the observed sex differences.

In the current study 143 community-dwelling older adults aged between 55 and 83 years old, were divided into three age groups based on tertials of age. All participants were asked to complete five trials of obstacle walking and five trials of normal walking. For the trials of normal walking, the main difference between groups was that MoS at initial contact was lower in the older age groups. For the trials of obstacle crossing the MoS at the instants of obstacle crossing with both the leading and trailing limb became smaller with an increase in age. This result might imply that older people choose to use a strategy during obstacle crossing that results in smaller chance of falling forward if an obstacle was struck. A negative consequence of this more conservative strategy was a smaller MoS at the instants of initial contact after crossing the obstacle, thus a larger chance of a backward fall. These findings provide more insight into the regulation of stability during obstacle crossing and specifically in the differences in strategy between younger and older people, and therefore these results might be used for further research to investigate whether obstacle crossing strategies are trainable in older adults, which could be used as advisory programs aimed at fall prevention and/or engagement in an active lifestyle.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

A framework was built that generates computational models from 3D arm scans using a depth sensing camera. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed on the scans taken from 23 lymphoedema patients. Subgarment pressures were calculated based on local curvature for each patient and showed a large variability of pressure across each arm. Across the cohort an average maximum subgarment pressure of 5100 Pa was found as opposed to an intended garment pressure of 2500 Pa. Subcutaneous results show that stresses/strains in the adipose tissues more closely follow the subgarment pressures than in the stiffer skin tissues. Another novel finding was that a negative axial gradient in subgarment pressure (from wrist to elbow) consistently led to positive axial gradients for the Von Mises stresses in the adipose tissues; a phenomenon caused by a combination of arm shape and the stiffness ratio between skin and adipose tissues. In conclusion, this work fills a knowledge gap in compression therapy in clinical practice and can inform garment design or lead to optimal treatment strategies.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Sensitivity of these models to the errors in post-imaging evaluation of displacements (reported to be ∼0.4-0.9° and 0.2-0.3 mm in vertebral displacements) has not yet been investigated. A Monte Carlo analysis was therefore used to assess the sensitivity of results in both musculoskeletal (MS) and passive finite element (FE) spine models to errors in measured displacements. Six static activities in upright standing, flexed, and extended postures were initially simulated using a force-control hybrid MS-FE model. Computed vertebral displacements were subsequently used to drive two distinct fully displacement-control MS and FE models. Effects of alterations in the reference vertebral displacements (at 3 error levels with SD (standard deviation) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm in input translations together with, respectively, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6° in input rotations) were investigated on the model predictions. Results indicated that outputs of both models had substantial task-dependent sensitivities to errors in the measured vertebral translations. For instance, L5-S1 intradiscal pressures (IDPs) were considerably affected (SD values reaching 1.05 MPa) and axial compression and shear forces even reversed directions as translation errors increased to 0.3 mm. Outputs were however generally much less sensitive to errors in measured vertebral rotations. Accounting for the accuracies in image-based kinematics measurements, therefore, it is concluded that the current measured vertebral translation errors at and beyond 0.1 mm are too large to drive biomechanical models of the spine.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study explores the variables that define crawling performance in the context of an outdoor obstacle course used by military organizations worldwide to evaluate the effects of load and personal equipment on warfighter performance. Crawling kinematics, measured from four body-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) attached to the upper arms and thighs, are recorded for thirty-three participants. The IMU data is distilled to four metrics of crawling performance; namely, crawl speed, crawl stride time, ipsilateral limb coordination, and contralateral limb coordination. We hypothesize that higher performance (as identified by higher crawl speeds) is associated with more coordinated limbs and lower stride times. A cluster analysis groups participants into high and low performers exhibiting statistically significant differences across the four performance metrics. In particular, high performers exhibit superior limb coordination associated with a ""diagonal gait"" in which contralateral limbs move largely in-phase to produce faster crawl speeds and shorter crawl stride times. In contrast, low performers crawl at slower speeds with longer crawl stride times and less limb coordination.

Changes in thigh and shank movements and/or symmetry differences between limbs may predict risk of injury to the less stable limb or the need for rehabilitation. In this study, construct validity of the ROLS metrics was examined in twelve Division I women's basketball players during pre-season in preparation for their exercise training program. The subjects were categorized based on their injury history during the season: (Group 1) No reported injuries throughout the season, (Group 2) lower limb injury that did not result in missing any games, and (Group 3) lower limb injury that resulted in missing both practice and the remainder of their season. Significant differences were found in ROLS metrics at pre-season between Group 3 and other groups in a prospective cohort study (p < 0.05).

However, this population has a greater risk of falling relative to people without an amputation, which may be a barrier to running. Understanding how dynamic balance is maintained during running is important for removing this barrier. To investigate dynamic balance, we quantified whole-body angular momentum in eight people with a unilateral transtibial amputation (TTA) using running-specific prostheses (RSPs) compared to eight people without TTA during running at 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 m/s. People with TTA had greater ranges of whole-body angular momentum compared to people without TTA in the frontal and sagittal planes (p < 0.01). These greater ranges resulted from smaller peak medial, lateral, and braking ground reaction forces from the amputated leg compared to the intact leg and people without TTA. Reduced RSP mass relative to the biological leg also influenced whole-body angular momentum as evidenced by smaller ranges of amputated leg angular momentum compared to the intact leg in the frontal and sagittal planes. Smaller amputated leg angular momentum corresponded with smaller contralateral arm angular momentum in the sagittal plane (p < 0.01). People with TTA maintain balance during running with altered muscle coordination and prosthesis characteristics. Restoring mediolateral force generation through prosthetic design advances may help in regulating the frontal plane component of whole-body angular momentum for people with TTA, with potential to improve their ability to maintain balance during running.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

When failure occurs, it usually manifests as transverse buckling. Because this failure mode is closely related to transverse tissue stiffness, the purpose of this study was to develop a method for measuring the transverse Young's modulus of maize stalk rind and pith tissues. Short, disc-shaped stalk segments were used for this purpose. X-ray computed tomography was used to obtain the geometry of each specimen prior to testing. Each specimen was tested in two different configurations. Computed tomography data was used to create a specimen-specific finite element model of each test specimen. Data from the first testing configuration was used in conjunction with the finite element model to determine the Young's Modulus values for each specimen. The specimen-specific finite element models provided estimates of the stress states in the stem under transverse loading, and these stress states accurately predicted the location of failure in transverse test specimens. The entire testing method was validated using data from one test configuration to predict the structural response of each specimen during the second test configuration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Range of motion (ROM) monitoring includes idealized clinic measures (e.g. goniometry during passive ROM) that may not accurately represent knee function. Accordingly, a novel, portable, inertial measurement unit (IMU) based ROM measurement method was developed, validated, and implemented. Knee flexion was computed via relative motion between two IMUs and validated via optical motion capture (p > 0.05). Prospective analyses of 10 healthy individuals (5M, 50 ± 19 years) and 20 patients undergoing TKA (3 lost to follow up, 10M, 65 ± 6 years) were completed. Controls wore IMUs for 1-week. Patients wore IMUs for 1-week pre-TKA, 6-weeks immediately post-TKA, and 1-week at 1-year post-TKA. Flexion was computed continuously each day (8-12 h). Metrics included daily maximum flexion and flexion during stance/swing phases of gait. Maximum flexion was equal between cohorts at all time points. Contrastingly, patient stance and swing flexion were reduced pre-TKA, yet improved post-TKA. Specifically, patient stance and swing flexion were reduced below control/pre-TKA values during post-TKA week 1. Stance flexion exceeded pre-TKA and equaled control levels after week 2. However, swing flexion only exceeded pre-TKA and equaled control levels at 1-year post-TKA. This novel method improves upon the accuracy/portability of current methods (e.g. goniometry). Interestingly, surgery did not impact maximum ROM, yet improved the ability to flex during gait allowing more efficient and safe ambulation. This is the first study continuously monitoring long-term flexion before/after TKA. The results offer richer information than clinical measures about expected TKA rehabilitation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although several step detection methods based on the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been successfully proposed, they may not perform adequately when the foot is dragged while walking, when walking aids are used, or when walking at low speed. The aim of this study was to test an original step-detection method, the inter-foot distance step counter (IFOD), based on the direct measurement of the distance between feet. Gait data were recorded using a wearable prototype system (SWING2DS), which integrates an IMU and two time-of-flight distance sensors (DSs). The system was attached to the medial side of the right foot with one DS positioned close to the forefoot (FOREDS) and the other close to the rearfoot (REARDS). Sixteen healthy adults were asked to walk over ground for two minutes along a loop, including both rectilinear and curvilinear portions, during two experimental sessions. The accuracy of the IFOD step counter was assessed using a stereo-photogrammetric system as gold standard. The best performance was obtained for REARDS with an accuracy higher than 99.8% for the instrumented foot step and 88.8% for the non-instrumented foot step during both rectilinear and curvilinear walks. Key features of the IFOD step counter are that it is possible to detect both right and left steps by instrumenting one foot only and that it does not rely on foot impact dynamics. The IFOD step counter can be combined with existing IMU-based methods for increasing step-detection accuracy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, simulations that can predict the forces in the muscles during activity while maintaining sufficient complexity to realistically represent the muscles and joint structures can be computationally challenging. For this reason, the current state of the art is to apply separate rigid-body dynamic and finite-element (FE) analyses in series. However, the use of two or more disconnected models often fails to capture key interactions between the joint-level and whole-body scales. Single framework MSFE models have the potential to overcome the limitations associated with disconnected models in series. The objectives of the current study were to create a multi-scale FE model of the human lower extremity that combines optimization, dynamic muscle modeling, and structural FE analysis in a single framework and to apply this framework to evaluate the mechanics of healthy knee specimens during two activities. Two subject-specific FE models (Model 1, Model 2) of the lower extremity were developed in ABAQUS/Explicit including detailed representations of the muscles. Muscle forces, knee joint loading, and articular contact were calculated for two activities using an inverse dynamics approach and static optimization. Quadriceps muscle forces peaked at the onset of chair rise (2174 N, 1962 N) and in early stance phase (510 N, 525 N), while gait saw peak forces in the hamstrings (851 N, 868 N) in midstance.

These analyses can be performed by having an individual perform repeated over-ground running trials or simply run continuously on an instrumented treadmill. The forces produced during over-ground running may not be the same as the forces during treadmill running and these differences could be attributed to a number of factors, including the design of the instrumented treadmill. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether there are differences in force measurements on different instrumented treadmill setups in comparison to over-ground running and to correct for any of these differences using a theoretical model. 11 participants ran on three different treadmills and performed over-ground running at 2.7, 3.6, and 4.5 m/s. Ground reaction forces were measured via force plates and an instrumented pressure insole. We found that the magnitude of the vertical ground reaction force differed between the three treadmills and over-ground running. The difference in ground reaction forces estimated by the pressure insole and the treadmill-force-plate system or instrumented treadmill can be explained by a three degree of freedom mechanical model of a person running on a treadmill and this model could potentially be used to correct for errors in force measurement from instrumented treadmills. The model included a force plate, a treadmill, and a wobbling mass with varying natural frequencies and damping characteristics, and constant masses. These findings provide researchers a method to correct forces from an instrumented treadmill set-up to determine a close approximation of the actual forces experienced by a participant during treadmill running.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One hundred sixty-six healthy community-dwelling older adults were randomly assigned to either the treadmill-slip-training group (Tt) or the treadmill-control group (Tc). Tt received 40 slip-like perturbations during treadmill walking. Tc received unperturbed treadmill walking for 30 min. Following their treadmill session, both groups were exposed to a novel slip during over-ground walking. Their responses to this novel slip were also compared to previously collected data from participants who received either over-ground-slip training (Ot) with 24 slips or over-ground walking (Oc) with no training before experiencing their novel over-ground slip. Fall rates and both proactive (pre-slip) and reactive (post-slip) stability were assessed and compared for the novel over-ground slip in groups Tt, Tc, and Oc, as well as for the 24th slip in Ot. Results showed Tt had fewer falls than Tc (9.6% versus 43.8%, p < 0.001) but more falls than Ot (9.6% versus 0%, p < 0.001). Tt also had greater proactive and reactive stability than Tc (Tt > Tc, p < 0.01), however, Tt's stabilities were lower than those of Ot (p < 0.01). There was no difference in fall-rate or reactive stability between Tc and Oc, though treadmill walking did improve the proactive stability control of the latter. While the treadmill-slip-training protocol could immediately reduce the numbers of falls from a novel laboratory-reproduced slip, such improvements were far less than that from the motor adaptation to the over-ground-slip-training protocol.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, detailed finite element models rarely include muscle recruitment due to the computational burden of both the finite element method and the optimization strategies widely used to estimate muscle forces. The aim of this study was twofold: first, to develop a computationally efficient muscle force prediction strategy based on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to track gait and chair rise experimental joint motion with a finite element musculoskeletal model of the lower limb, including a deformable knee representation with 12 degrees of freedom; and, second, to demonstrate that the inclusion of joint-level deformability affects muscle force estimation by using two different knee models and comparing muscle forces between the two solutions. The PID control strategy tracked experimental hip, knee, and ankle flexion/extension with root mean square errors below 1°, and estimated muscle, contact and ligament forces in good agreement with previous results and electromyography signals. Differences up to 11% and 20% in the vasti and biceps femoris forces, respectively, were observed between the two knee models, which might be attributed to a combination of differing joint contact geometry, ligament behavior, joint kinematics, and muscle moment arms. The tracking strategy developed in this study addressed the inevitable tradeoff between computational cost and model detail in musculoskeletal simulations and can be used with finite element musculoskeletal models to efficiently estimate the interdependence between muscle forces and tissue deformation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For example, when human runners face a change in ground level, they adapt the height of their center of mass (CoM) in preparation. In a situation in which a drop might occur but without visual cues regarding its actual height, such a preparation is not possible. We here used camouflaged drops (which occurred by chance) as mechanical disturbances and analyzed the adaptations in the vertical oscillation of the runners CoM. We found that humans lowered their CoM by about 25% of the possible drop height in preparation for the camouflaged contact, regardless of whether a drop occurred or not. In flight phase following the disturbance, the CoM was lowered by about 90% of the drop height in the case of the camouflaged drop and remained almost unaffected (+5%) in the case of level ground. Thus, runners resort to a CoM-control strategy with a fixed desired trajectory height in the flight phase following the camouflaged ground contact. In contrast to previously reported results which show that visible ground level changes were compensated within several steps, this strategy compensates ground level disturbances instantly within a single step.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study uses a collision-based approach to analyze how these energy losses change with slope and speed. Therefore, we evaluate separately the average collision angle, i.e. the angle of deviation from perpendicular relationship between the force and velocity vectors, during the absorptive and generative part of stance. Our results show that on the level, the collision angle of the absorptive phase is smaller than the collision angle of the generative phase, suggesting that the collision is generative to overcome energy losses by soft tissues. When running uphill, the collision becomes more and more generative as slope increases because the average upward vertical velocity of the COM becomes greater than on the level. When running downhill at a constant speed, the collision angle decreases during the generative phase and increases during the absorptive phase because the average downward vertical velocity of the COM becomes greater. As a result, the difference between the collision angles of the generative and absorptive phases observed on the level disappears on a shallow negative slope of ∼-6°, where the collision becomes 'pseudo-elastic' and collisional energy losses are minimized. At this 'optimal' slope, the metabolic energy consumption is minimal. On steeper negative slopes, the collision angle during the absorptive phase becomes greater than during the generative phase and the collision is absorptive. At all slopes, the collision becomes more generative when speed increases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Abnormal gait mechanics and potentially abnormal muscle forces within FAI patients leads to articular cartilage damage. Therefore, there is a necessity to understand the effects of FAI on hip joint muscle forces during gait and the link between muscle forces, patient reported outcomes (PRO) and articular cartilage health. The purposes of this study were to assess: (1) hip muscle forces between FAI patients and healthy controls and (2) the associations between hip muscle forces with PRO and cartilage composition (T1ρ/T2 mapping) within FAI patients. Musculoskeletal simulations were used to estimate peak muscle forces during the stance phase of gait in 24 FAI patients and 24 healthy controls. Compared to controls, FAI patients ambulated with lower vasti (30% body-weight, p = 0.01) and higher sartorius (4.0% body-weight, p < 0.01) forces.

Here, we investigate this microfluidic chip design and examine its potential in performances. We first develop the simultaneous dependence of the transit time on both the shear and bending moduli of a cell, and then examine the chip sensitivity with respect to the cell mechanical properties while serializing a single constriction along the flow direction. After that, we study the effect of the flow velocity on the transit time, and also test the chip's ability to identify heterogeneous cells with different mechanical properties. The results show that the microfluidic chip designed is capable of identifying heterogeneous cells, even when only one unhealthy cell is included. The serialization of chip can greatly increase the chip sensitivity with respect to the mechanical properties of cells. The flow with a higher velocity helps in not only promoting the chip throughput, but also in providing more accurate transit time measurements, because the cell prefers a symmetric deformation under a high velocity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In all four software many valuable features were available, with minimum differences, and bone models of good quality were obtained. Large differences in file sizes (mean range over the five anatomical models 66-338) and in the number of triangles (870-1350 thousands) were found, with triangles for MByte ratio ranging from about 4 to 20 thousands. The distance-map analysis revealed that root mean square deviation averaged over the five anatomical models ranged from 0.13 to 2.21 mm for the six spatial matches between the four software.

It has been established that as running speed increases, stiffness of the leg spring (leg stiffness; kleg) remains constant in non-amputees. Although a better understanding of kleg regulation may be helpful for the development of spring-based prostheses, little is known about stiffness regulation in unilateral transfemoral amputees. The aim of this study was to investigate stiffness regulation at different running speeds in unilateral transfemoral amputees wearing a running-specific prosthesis. Nine unilateral transfemoral amputees performed running on an instrumented treadmill across a range of speeds (30, 40, 50, 60, and 70% of their maximum running speed). Using a spring-mass model, kleg was calculated as the ratio of maximal vertical ground reaction force to maximum leg compression during the stance phase in both affected and unaffected limbs. We found a decrease in kleg from the slower speed to 70% speed for the affected limb, whereas no change was present in the unaffected limb. Specifically, there was a significant differences in the kleg between 30% and 70%, 40% and 70%, and 50% and 70%, and the magnitude of the kleg difference between affected and unaffected limbs varied with variations in running speeds in unilateral TFAs with an RSP.

The proposed DNN based method addresses problems associated with marker-based motion capture systems like excessive preparation time, movement obstruction, and controlled environment requirement. Twelve healthy adults participated in a protocol and performed nine lifting tasks with different vertical heights and asymmetry angles. They lifted a crate and placed it on a shelf while being filmed by two camcorders and a synchronized motion capture system, which directly measured their body movement. A DNN with two-stage cascaded structure was designed to estimate subjects' 3D body pose from images captured by camcorders. Our DNN augmented Hourglass network for monocular 2D pose estimation with a novel 3D pose generator subnetwork, which synthesized information from all available views to predict accurate 3D pose. We validated the results against the marker-based motion capture system as a reference and examined the method performance under different lifting conditions.

But it has not been validated if such force and activity calculations are valid during highly dynamic multidirectional movements. The purpose of this study was to validate calculated muscle activation of a lower extremity model with a spherical knee joint for running, sprinting and 90°-cutting. Kinematics, kinetics and lower limb muscle activation of ten participants were investigated in a 3D motion capture setup including EMG. A lower extremity rigid body model was used to calculate the activation of these muscles with an inverse dynamics approach and a cubic cost function. Correlation coefficients were calculated to compare measured and calculated activation. The results showed good correlation of the modelled and calculated data with a few exceptions. The highest average correlations were found during walking (r = 0.81) and the lowest during cutting (r = 0.57). Tibialis anterior had the lowest average correlation (r = 0.33) over all movements while gastrocnemius medius had the highest correlation (r = 0.9). The implementation of a spherical knee joint increased the agreement between measured and modelled activation compared to studies using a hinge joint knee. Although some stabilizing muscles showed low correlations during dynamic movements, the investigated model calculates muscle activity sufficiently.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To date, only a limited amount of research has been conducted comparing commercial IMU systems to optoelectronic systems, the gold standard, for everyday tasks like stair climbing and inclined walking. In this paper, the 3D joint angles of the lower limbs are determined using both an IMU system and an optoelectronic system for twelve participants during stair ascent and descent, and inclined, declined and level walking. Three different datasets based on different hardware and anatomical models were collected for the same movement in an effort to determine the cause and quantify the errors involved with the analysis. Firstly, to calculate software errors, two different anatomical models were compared for one hardware system. Secondly, to calculate hardware errors, results were compared between two different measurement systems using the same anatomical model. Finally, the overall error between both systems with their native anatomical models was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping. When both systems were evaluated based on the same anatomical model, the number of trials with significant differences decreased markedly. Thus, the differences in joint angle measurement can mainly be attributed to the variability in the anatomical models used for calculations and not to the IMU hardware.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The current work provides the closed-form sample size formulas for two major study designs (i.e. paired and two-group designs) in vocal fold research. Our results demonstrated that the paired design could greatly increase the statistical power compared to the two-group design. By comparing the variance of estimated treatment effect, this study also confirms that ignoring within-subject and within-vocal fold correlations during rheological data analysis will likely increase type I errors.

The current study presents a method for predicting the GRFs in level and incline/decline walking that may be used in various outdoor biomechanics studies geared towards the above applications. The method was developed to predict the complete set of GRFs at walking inclinations of 0°, ±5°, ±10°, ±15°, and ±20°. Plantar pressure insoles were used to obtain inclination-specific, linear regression models based on three periods of gait stance phase, and the model-determined GRFs were compared with those measured from a forceplate. The three periods were determined based on the observed shifting of load-bearing insole sensors from heel to forefoot during walking, i.e., heel-strike, midstance, and toe-off. Six subjects wearing minimalist shoes fitted with plantar pressure insoles containing 99 pressure sensors performed ten walking trials at each of the aforementioned inclinations on an adjustable ramp with an embedded forceplate. Data from contact of the instrumented shoes with the forceplate were used to create linear regressions to transform insole pressure data into a complete set of GRFs. The root mean square error (RMSE) over peak recorded values were on average 10%, 3%, 21% for level walking and 11%, 4%, 23% for ramp walking in the respective anteroposterior, vertical, and mediolateral directions.

This technology showed promising outcomes in improving somatosensory acuity in other clinical patients (e.g., Parkinson's disease and osteoarthritis). Some degree of chronic somatosensory deficiency in the knee has been reported following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. In this study, the effect of the SR phenomenon on improving knee somatosensory acuity (proprioception and kinesthesia) in female ACL reconstructed (ACLR) participants (n = 19) was tested at three months post-surgery, and the results were compared to healthy controls (n = 28). Proprioception was quantified by the measure of joint position sense (JPS) and kinesthesia with the threshold to detection of passive movement (TDPM). The results based on the statistical analysis demonstrated an overall difference between the somatosensory acuity in the ACLR limb compared to healthy controls (p = 0.007). A larger TDPM was observed in the ACLR limb compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.002). However, the JPS between the ACLR and healthy limbs were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.365). SR significantly improved JPS (p = 0.006) while the effect was more pronounced in the ACLR cohort. The effect on the TDPM did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.681) in either group. In conclusion, deficient kinesthesia in the ACLR limb was observed at three months post-surgery. Also, the positive effects of SR on somatosensory acuity in the ACL reconstructed group warrant further investigation into the use of this phenomenon to improve proprioception in ACLR and healthy groups.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Platelets are activated by non-physiologic shear stresses in the bulk flow or the leakage/hinge flow, whose contributions has yet to be quantified. Here, the contribution of bulk and hinge flows to the activation of platelets in BMHVs is quantified for the first time by performing simulations of the flow through a BMHV and resolving the hinge by overset grids (one grid for the bulk flow and two for the hinge regions coupled together using one-way and two-way interpolation). It was found that two-way coupling is essential to obtain correct hinge flow features. The platelet activation through the hinge for two gap sizes (250 and 150 μm) is compared to the activation in the bulk flow using two platelet activation models to ensure the consistency of the observed trends. The larger gap has a higher total activation, but a better washout ability due to higher velocities. The maximum shear stress observed in the bulk flow (∼320dyne/cm2) is much smaller than the hinge (∼1000dyne/cm2). However, the total activation by the bulk flow is found to be several folds higher than by the hinge/leakage flow. This is mainly due to the higher flow rate of the bulk flow which exposes much more platelets to shear stress than the leakage flow.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study examined potential differences in retention of improvements in reactive gait stability over 14 weeks resulting from unexpected trip-like gait perturbations. Twenty-four healthy middle-aged adults (41-62 years) were assigned randomly to either a single perturbation group (SINGLE, n = 9) or a group subjected to eight trip-like gait perturbations (MULTIPLE, n = 15). While participants walked on a treadmill a custom-built brake-and-release system was used to unexpectedly apply resistance during swing phase to the lower right limb via an ankle strap. The anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS) was calculated as the difference between the anterior boundary of the base of support and the extrapolated centre of mass at foot touchdown for the perturbed step and the first recovery step during the first and second (MULTIPLE group only) perturbation trials for the initial walking session and retention-test walking 14 weeks later. Group MULTIPLE retained the improvements in reactive gait stability to the perturbations (increased MoS at touchdown for perturbed and first recovery steps; p < 0.01). However, in group SINGLE no differences in MoS were detected after 14 weeks compared to the initial walking session.

The device offers the possibility to get associated or dissociated seesaws and, if dissociated, to induce asymmetric patterns for the centers-of-pressure (CP) under both left and right feet by using different radii for the two seesaws. Substituting a parallelepiped volume to one seesaw offering a firm contact to one foot is also possible. The results indicated that dissociating the two seesaws led to increased resultant CP (CPRes) and vertically projected center-of-gravity movements (CGv) only along the mediolateral axis, whereas a slight decreasing tendency characterized these movements along the antero-posterior axis. When standing on two independent seesaws with different radii, significantly larger CP displacements were seen along the antero-posterior axis under the foot lying on the more stable support, i.e., the seesaw with the longer radius or the parallelepiped volume. In these two asymmetrical conditions, the CPRes output results from a compensatory mechanism, i.e. larger movements under one foot to compensate for the decreased movements occurring under the opposite foot. This postural control strategy is aimed at allowing sufficient CPRes displacements in order to appropriately secure balance. Because of the complex sensorimotor coordination induced, involving differentially in certain cases both legs, the double seesaw device can be viewed as a possible tool for challenging postural control by inducing asymmetrical patterns between left and right feet CP movements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It has been shown to correlate with both passive and active muscle forces, and is sensitive to physiological processes and pathological conditions. Similarly, intramuscular pressure (IMP) is an important parameter that changes with passive and active muscle contraction, body position, exercise, blood pressure, and several pathologies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the dependency of shear modulus within the lower-leg muscles on IMP in healthy individuals. Nineteen healthy individuals (age: Mean age ± SD, 23.84 ± 6.64 years) were recruited. Shear modulus was measured using ultrasound SWE on the tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PL) muscles using pressure cuff inflation around the thigh at 40 mmHg, 80 mmHg, and 120 mmHg. Changes in IMP were verified using a catheter connected to a blood pressure monitor. It was found that IMP was correlated to TA and PL shear modulus (spearman's rank correlation = 0.99 and 0.99, respectively). Applying a gradual increase of cuff pressure from 0 to 120 mmHg increased the shear modulus of the TA and PL muscles from 15.83 (2.46) kPa to 21.88 (4.33) kPa and from 9.64 (1.97) kPa to 12.88 (5.99) kPa, respectively.

If the human motion is derived rapidly as design parameters change, a developer could determine the optimal parameters. For example, the optimal design of the door panel of an automobile can be obtained for a human operator to conduct the easiest ingress and egress motion. However, acquiring motion data from existing methods provides only unrealistic motion or requires a great amount of time. This not only leads to an increased time consumption for a product development, but also causes inefficiency of the overall design process. To solve such problems, this research proposes an algorithm to rapidly and accurately predict full-body human motion using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a motion database, as the design parameters are varied. To achieve this goal, this study refers to the processes behind human motor learning procedures. According to the previous research, human generate new motion based on past motion experience when they encounter new environments. Based on this principle, we constructed a motion capture database. To construct the database, motion capture experiments were performed in various environments using an optical motion capture system. To generate full-body human motion using this data, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was used. The proposed algorithm not only guarantees rapid and accurate results but also overcomes the ambiguity of the human motion objective function, which has been pointed out as a limitation of optimization-based research. Statistical criteria were utilized to confirm the similarity between the generated motion and actual human motion. Our research provides the basis for a rapid motion prediction algorithm that can include a variety of environmental variables.

One unresolved issue is the role of dynamic loading. In comparison to static loading, dynamic loading is thought to enhance transport by increasing convection. However, the CEP has a high resistance to fluid flow, which could limit solute convection. Here we measure solute transport through site-matched cadaveric human lumbar CEP tissues under static vs. dynamic loading, and we determine how the degree of transport enhancement from dynamic loading depends on CEP porosity and solute size. We found that dynamic loading significantly increased small and large solute transport through the CEP: on average, dynamic loading increased the transport of sodium fluorescein (376 Da) by a factor of 1.85 ± 0.64 and the transport of a large dextran (4000 Da) by a factor of 4.97 ± 3.05. Importantly, CEP porosity (0.65 ± 0.07; range: 0.47-0.76) strongly influenced the degree of transport enhancement. Specifically, for both solutes, transport enhancement was greater for CEPs with low porosity than for CEPs with high porosity. This is because the CEPs with low porosity were susceptible to larger improvements in fluid flow under dynamic loading. The CEP becomes less porous and less hydrated with aging and as disc degeneration progresses. Together, these findings suggest that as those changes occur, dynamic loading has a greater effect on solute transport through the CEP compared to static loading, and thus may play a larger role in disc nutrition.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, forefoot strike may overload the plantar fascia and impose risk of plantar fasciitis. This study aimed to examine and compare the foot arch deformation and plantar fascia tension between different foot strike techniques in running using a computational modelling approach. A three-dimensional finite element foot model was reconstructed from the MRI of a healthy runner. The foot model included twenty bones, bulk soft tissue, ligaments, tendons, and plantar fascia. The time-series data of segmental kinematics, foot muscle force, and ankle joint reaction force were derived from a musculoskeletal model of the same participant based on the motion capture analysis and input as the boundary conditions for the finite element analysis. Rearfoot strike and forefoot strike running were simulated using a dynamic explicit solver. The results showed that, compared to rearfoot strike, forefoot strike reduced the foot arch height by 9.12% and increased the medial longitudinal arch angle by 2.06%. Forefoot strike also increased the plantar connective tissues stress by 18.28-200.11% and increased the plantar fascia tensile force by 18.71-109.10%.

The processing methods of the electronic dynamometer-derived signal may influence the outcome measures. This study determined the influence of filtering and sample rate (SR) on isometric torque-time parameters and provides specific signal processing recommendations for future studies. Twenty-three subjects performed 49 isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the knee extensors on an isokinetic dynamometer. Outcome measures included peak torque (PT), and rate of torque development at peak (RTDPEAK), 50 (RTD50) and 200 (RTD200) ms for seven filter conditions including low-pass filter cutoffs at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150 Hz and a notch filter at 100 and 200 Hz. Comparisons were also made across four SR conditions at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz. The RTDPEAK variable was markedly changed (-5.4 to -37.9%) for all filter frequencies compared to the 150 Hz condition and the RTD50 variable was altered for all frequencies between 50 and 5 Hz. No differences were found for RTD200. For SR, compared to the 2000 Hz condition, differences were revealed for the 100 Hz condition for the RTDPEAK and RTD50 variables.

The filter and SR applied to the signal was capable of distorting the MVC signal and skewing the torque-time parameters, specifically for the early and maximum RTD variables of the MVC curve (RTD50 and RTDPEAK).

Falls in elderly adults happen mainly during the redirection of the center of mass of the body (CoM) in the transition between steps. In young adults, this step-to-step transition begins before the double contact phase (DC) with a simultaneous forward and upward acceleration of the CoM. We hypothesize that, compared to young adults, elderly adults would exhibit unbalanced contribution of the back leg and the front leg during the transition. We calculated the mean vertical push-off done by the back leg (FBACK) and the mean impact force on the front leg (FFRONT) during the transition. Eight young (mean ± SD; age: 24 ± 2 y) and 19 elderly (age: 74 ± 6 y) healthy adults walked on a force-measuring treadmill at five selected speeds ranging from 0.56 to 1.67 m·s-1. Results show that, at mid and high speeds, elderly adults exhibit a smaller FBACK compared to young adults, possibly linked to the decreased plantar flexion of the back foot. As a consequence, FFRONT is significantly increased and the transition begins lately in the step, at the beginning of DC. Also, elderly adults show an inability to accelerate the CoM upward and forward simultaneously. Our findings show a different adaptation of the step-to-step transition with speed in elderly adults and identify two potential indicators of gait impairment with age: the FFRONT/FBACK contribution and the synchronization between the upward and forward acceleration of the CoM during the transition.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyse this effect in ski-jumpers as representatives of a specific group (i.e. low body mass index) by comparing calculated and measured ground reaction forces during ski-jumping imitation jumps. Full body kinematics and vertical ground reaction forces were recorded of 9 ski-jumpers performing three imitation jumps each. BSP were estimated using three previously published, one individually optimized and one ski-jumper group specific model. Vertical ground reaction forces were calculated using the vertical acceleration of the segments as well as the BSP of the single models in a top-down approach. Statistical analysis revealed a main model effect concerning the root mean square error between the calculated and the measured ground reaction force with deviations between the models of 53%. Individual optimization and the application of the ski-jumper group specific model increased the accuracy of the calculated ground reaction forces by 11 and 7%, respectively, compared to the best performing published model.

We investigated how and in which measure a system based on wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide an objective support to the diagnosis of motor impairments in school-aged children. The IMUs measured linear and rotational movements of 37 schoolchildren, 7-10yo, 17 patients and 20 control subjects, during the execution of motor exercises, performed under medical and psychiatric supervision, to assess different aspects of the motor coordination. The measured motor parameters showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the ADHD/DCD patients from the healthy subjects, pointing out which motor tasks are worth focusing on. So, medical doctors have a novel key lecture to state a diagnosis, gaining in objectivity with respect to the standard procedures which mainly involve subjective human judgment. Differently to other works, we propose a novel approach in terms of number of used IMUs and of performed motor tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the meaningful parameters to be considered as more discriminant in supporting the medical diagnosis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A novel approach that could augment current fall prevention procedures is to teach older adults movement strategies to reduce the risk of injury. The purpose of the study was to determine whether older adults can learn a movement strategy (""tuck-and-roll"") that reduces fall impact severity. Learning was quantified with short-term acquisition, bilateral transfer and 1-week-retention. 14 healthy older individuals participated (63.9 ± 5.6 years) in the investigation. Participants were randomly assigned into either training group (n = 7) or active control group (n = 7). All participants performed standardized sideway falls at baseline, immediately post intervention and 1-week-retention tests. During the falling assessments, kinetic and kinematic impact severity parameters were measured. The results for short-term learning revealed that the training group showed greater reduction in hip impact force (33% reduction) than the control group (16% reduction). Furthermore, there was partial bilateral transfer effect and 1-week retention observed in the training group. The observations provide preliminary evidence that teaching tuck-and-roll strategy to older adults has potential effect.

Our objective was to compare mechanotransductive processes in therapeutic cell candidates (mesenchymal stromal cells from adipose tissue and bone marrow, AT-MSC and BM-MSC) to native cells (vocal fold fibroblasts-VFF) in the context of vibratory strain. A bioreactor was used to expose VFF, AT-MSC, and BM-MSC to axial tensile strain and vibration at human physiological levels. Microarray, an empirical Bayes statistical approach, and geneset enrichment analysis were used to identify significant mechanotransductive pathways associated with the three cell types and three mechanical conditions. Two databases (Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were used for enrichment analyses. VFF shared more mechanotransductive pathways with BM-MSC than with AT-MSC. Gene expression that appeared to distinguish the vibratory strain condition from polystyrene condition for these two cells types related to integrin activation, focal adhesions, and lamellipodia activity, suggesting that vibratory strain may be associated with cytoarchitectural rearrangement, cell reorientation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In response to vibration and tensile stress, BM-MSC better mimicked VFF mechanotransduction than AT-MSC, providing support for the consideration of BM-MSC as a cell therapy for vocal fold tissue engineering.

The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of the respective reference point upon the resulting kinematic tracking variables. We present a marker-based method comparing center of pelvis (COP) derived tracking variables with center of scapulae (COS) derived tracking variables in a 30 × 30 m (900 m2) VICON measurement area. Fourteen male soccer players completed a running circuit with prescribed team-sport specific movements. Results showed that differences between COP and COS heavily depend on the underlying movement characteristic. Low-speed running showed the lowest deviations whereas accelerated movements and movements with sharp changes in direction lead to a significant increase in the observed differences. Results further showed that COS sprinting distance was on average -44.65% (p < 0.001) lower in comparison to COP. Similarly, maximum speed obtained from COS was -2.94% (p = 0.001) lower in comparison to COP. On the contrary, maximum acceleration values of COS were on average 16.15% (p = 0.02) higher compared to COP.

They returned within one week and completed a 5-minute familiarization followed by a 16-minute experimental trial each for FeedbackTM and FixedTM conditions. Mean walking speed and step time, length, width, and speed means and coefficient of variation were calculated from all experimental conditions. Step time, length, width, and speed gait dynamics were analyzed using detrended fluctuation analysis. Mean differences between experimental trials were determined using ANOVAs and reliability between FeedbackTM sessions was determined by intraclass correlation coefficient. No difference was found in mean walking speed nor spatiotemporal variables, with the exception of step width, between the experimental trials. All mean spatiotemporal variables demonstrated good to excellent reliability between sessions, while coefficient of variation was not reliable. Gait dynamics of step time, length, width, and speed were significantly more persistent during the FeedbackTM condition compared to FixedTM, especially step speed. However, gait dynamics demonstrated fair to poor reliability between FeedbackTM sessions.

In parallel with neurological changes, material properties of muscles in the impaired limbs, such as muscle stiffness, may also change progressively. However, these stiffness measures are routinely derived from individual joint stiffness, representing whole muscle groups. Here, we use shear wave (SW) ultrasound elastography to measure SW velocity, as a surrogate measure of stiffness, to quantify material properties in individual muscles. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare muscle material properties of the bicep brachii in stroke survivors and in age-matched control subjects by measuring SW velocity at rest and different voluntary activation levels. Our main findings show that at rest, the SW velocity was on average 41% greater in the paretic muscle compared the contralateral non-paretic muscle. The mean passive SW velocity across all subjects were 2.34 ± 0.41 m/s for the non-paretic side, 3.30 ± 1.20 m/s for the paretic side, and 2.24 ± 0.18 for controls. SW velocity was significantly different in muscles of the paretic and non-paretic side (p < 0.001), but not between muscles of the non-paretic and controls (p = 0.47). As voluntary activation increased, SW velocity increased non-linearly, with an average power fit of r2 = 0.83 ± 0.09 for the non-paretic side, r2 = 0.61 ± 0.24 for the paretic side, and r2 = 0.24 ± 0.15 for the healthy age-matched controls. In active muscle (10, 25, 50, 75, 100% maximum voluntary contraction), there was no significant difference in SW velocity between the non-paretic, paretic, and control muscles.

SLI resulted in decreased tibial trabecular BV/TV, Tb Th, and Tb N compared to contralateral limbs in young mice. Femoral trabecular BV/TV, Tb Th, Tb N, and femoral cortical area fraction were also decreased. Mechanical properties were not affected after three weeks. In adult mice, femoral trabecular BV/TV, Tb Th, and Tb N were decreased. Femoral stiffness, ultimate stress, and Young's modulus were decreased.

Musculoskeletal models used to investigate mobility deficits for children with CP often lack subject-specific characteristics such as altered muscle strength, despite a high prevalence of muscle weakness in this population. We hypothesized that incorporating subject-specific strength scaling within musculoskeletal models of children with CP would improve accuracy of muscle excitation predictions in walking simulations. Ten children (13.5 ± 3.3 years; GMFCS level II) with spastic CP participated in a gait analysis session where lower-limb kinematics, ground reaction forces, and bilateral electromyography (EMG) of five lower-limb muscles were collected. Isometric strength was measured for each child using handheld dynamometry. Three musculoskeletal models were generated for each child including a 'Default' model with the generic musculoskeletal model's muscle strength, a 'Uniform' model with muscle strength scaled allometrically, and a 'Custom' model with muscle strength scaled based on handheld dynamometry strength measures. Muscle-driven gait simulations were generated using each model for each child. Simulation accuracy was evaluated by comparing predicted muscle excitations and measured EMG signals, both in the duration of muscle activity and the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between signals. Improved agreement with EMG were found in both the 'Custom' and 'Uniform' models compared to the 'Default' model indicated by improvement in RMSD summed across all muscles, as well as RMSD and duration of activity for individual muscles.

Control of upright posture requires stabilization of both translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom that is accomplished by neuro-muscular coordination. This coordination produces a force at the ground-foot interface (F) that is quantified by magnitude, direction (θF), and point of application (center-of-pressure, CP). Previous research has shown that the nervous system controls muscle activation such that CP motion occurs at both slow and fast time scales. However, it is unknown how θF varies with respect to CP and how that relationship varies across time scales. We present a novel method for assessing the frequency-dependent relative variation in θF and CP. The center-of-pressure (CP) and direction of the ground-on-foot force (F) in the sagittal-plane during quiet standing were decomposed into 0.2 Hz-width frequency bands within 0.4-8.0 Hz. The relation between the direction and CP was approximately linear with a slope positively related to frequency. These frequency-dependent features of F have critical implications for understanding balance strategy because the translational and rotational acceleration effects of F were coupled, but with opposite phasing at high versus low frequencies. Such results suggest a system tuned for one stability mode at low frequencies and another mode at higher frequencies. This frequency-wise approach to examining the translational and rotational effects of humans' preferred F may be useful for establishing balance rehabilitation metrics, directing study of the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for the observed coordination, and for setting a biometric standard to inform biomimetic prosthetics and robotics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A solution capable of automatically detecting the resistance force level exerted by a user from a wrist-based device can offer great convenience to the trainee and hence facilitate a better training outcome. In this short communication, we present our investigation aimed at exploring if force myographic (FMG) signals recorded at the wrist can predict the relative resistance levels that are associated with different weights. Specifically, we investigated the Spearman's correlations between the wrist FMG signal features and the dumbbell weights during a bicep curl exercise. 10 volunteers were recruited to perform a total of 100 curl actions, which included both the hammer and regular curls while the wrist FMG signals were being recorded. Three sets of weights ranging from 0.2 lb to 8 lb were used. For the hammer curls, a median correlation coefficient of 0.92 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.03 was obtained. For the regular curls, a 0.94 median correlation with a 0.02 IQR was obtained. We also used the data from the first 36 curls to generate a classifier model and applied it onto the rest of the data. An averaged validation accuracy of 88% was obtained. The results of this study showed the potential use of wrist FMG signal to detect different levels of the load during exercises; such information could potentially be used as feedback in fitness, sports, and rehabilitation activities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Analytical models of airway resistance for tracheobronchial airways have previously been developed and assessed without upper airways positioned upstream of the trachea. This work investigated pressure drop as a function of flow rate and gas properties for upper and central airway replicas of 10 child subjects, ages 4-8. Replica geometries were built based on computed tomography scan data and included airways from the nose through 3-5 distal branching airway generations. Pressure drop through the replicas was measured for constant inspiratory flows of air and heliox. For both the nose-throat and branching airways, the relationship between non-dimensional coefficient of friction, CF, with Reynolds number, Re, was found to resemble the turbulent Blasius equation for pipe flow, where CF∝Re-0.25. Additionally, pressure drop ratios between heliox and air were consistent with analytical predictions for turbulent flow. The presence of turbulence in the branching airways likely resulted from convection of turbulence produced upstream in the nose and throat. An airway resistance model based on the Blasius pipe friction correlation for turbulent flow was proposed for prediction of pressure drop through the branching bronchial airways downstream from the upper airway.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The plantarflexor (PF) muscles are critical to walking through their contributions to the ground reaction forces and body segment energetics. Previous studies have shown muscle activity during walking can be grouped into co-excited muscle sets, or modules. Improper co-activation, or merging of modules, is a common impairment in individuals post-stroke. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of merged PF modules on walking performance in individuals post stroke by examining balance control, body support and propulsion, and walking symmetry. Muscle modules were identified using non-negative matrix factorization to classify subjects as having an independent or merged PF module. The merged group had decreased balance control with a significantly higher frontal plane whole-body angular momentum than both the independent and control groups, while the independent and control groups were not significantly different. The merged group also had higher paretic braking and nonparetic propulsion than both the independent and control groups. These results remained when comparisons were limited to subjects who had the same number of modules, indicating this was not a general effect due to subjects with merged PF having fewer modules. It is likely that a merged PF module is indicative of general PF dysfunction even when some activation occurs at the appropriate time. These results suggest an independent PF module is critical to walking performance, and thus obtaining an independent PF module should be a crucial aim of stroke rehabilitation.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The main purpose of this study is to provide insights into the role of manipulability in selection of these strategies. A 37 degrees of freedom (DoFs) model of the human body is developed to evaluate the manipulability indices during walking. The model is considered as a tree-like structure and its forward kinematics equations and the Jacobian are derived based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention. A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is then employed to map the experimental kinematics of a human to the model. The kinematic and dynamic manipulability indices of the swing phase of walking are evaluated concentrating on early, mid and late swing phases. The results indicate that the manipulability indices can characterize well the selection of elevating, lowering and delayed-lowering strategies at different stages of the swing phase. The results kinematically describe the reason of selecting delayed-lowering strategy at mid-swing phase that was not obvious in previous studies. Moreover, the results show that at mid-swing phase of walking the kinematic maneuverability is lower than that of the early and late swing phases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One treatment is total ankle arthroplasty (TAA), however, its effects on balance are not well understood. This study analyzed balance over a two-year period following TAA. 408 subjects (177 left, 231 right ankles) diagnosed with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis performed quiet standing trials while center of pressure (COP) data were collected. Data were compared across three time points (pre-op, 1-year, and 2-years post-op) and between surgical and non-surgical limbs using a linear mixed model with significance set at P = 0.05. COP excursions in the feet-together condition were not significantly different between limbs after 2 years in anteroposterior or mediolateral directions (P = 0.06, 0.08) after being significantly different between limbs in the anteroposterior (P = 0.014) and mediolateral direction (P < 0.001) pre-op. The vertical ground reaction force significantly decreased across time in the non-surgical limb, while reciprocally increasing in the surgical limb (P < 0.001). After 2 years, no significant difference in vertical ground reaction force between limbs existed (P = 0.20). Limb asymmetry indices decreased at each time point in both conditions (all P < 0.001) and were not significantly different from zero after 2 years in the feet-together condition (P = 0.290). In conclusion, surgical limb balance improved compared to pre-op, resulting in increased symmetry between limbs after 2 years. Vertical ground reaction forces on both limbs converge and limb asymmetry indices approach zero two years post-op.

Compared to healthy controls, people with hip OA often present with altered muscle activation patterns and greater muscle co-contraction, both of which can influence HJCF. Neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) modelling is non-invasive approach to estimating HJCF, whereby different neural control solutions can be used to estimate muscle forces. Static optimisation, available within the popular NMS modelling software OpenSim, is a commonly used neural control solution, but may not account for an individual's unique muscle activation patterns and/or co-contraction that are often evident in pathological population. Alternatively, electromyography (EMG)-assisted neural control solutions, available within CEINMS software, have been shown to account for individual activation patterns in healthy people. Nonetheless, their application in people with hip OA, with conceivably greater levels of co-contraction, is yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to compare HJCF estimations using static optimisation (in OpenSim) and EMG-assisted (in CEINMS) neural control solutions during walking in people with hip OA. EMG-assisted neural control solution was more consistent with both EMG and joint moment data than static optimisation, and also predicted significantly higher HJCF peaks (p < 0.001). The EMG-assisted neural control solution also accounted for more muscle co-contraction than static optimisation (p = 0.03), which probably contributed to these higher HJCF peaks. Findings suggest that the EMG-assisted neural control solution may estimate more physiologically plausible HJCF than static optimisation in a population with high levels of co-contraction, such as hip OA.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The PC-eigenvectors then form a basis in the associated vector space of postural changes. Similar to 3D movements, the kinematics in this posture space can be quantified through 'principal' positions (PPs), velocities (PVs) and accelerations (PAs). The PAs represent a novel set of variables characterizing neuro-muscular control. The aim of the current technical note was to (i) compare the variance explained by PAs with the variance explained by PPs; (ii) clarify the relationship between PAs and segment accelerations; and (iii) compare variability of the first principal acceleration (PA1) with the local dynamic stability (largest Lyapunov exponent, LyE) of the first principal position (PP1). A PCA was applied on 3D upper-body positions collected by an Xsens inertial sensor system as nineteen volunteers performed a bimanual repetitive tapping task. The main finding revealed that the PP-explained variance considerably differed from the PA-explained variance, indicating that the latter should be considered when reducing the dimensionality in postural movement analysis through a PCA. Further, the current study formally established that the acceleration curves obtained from differentiating segment positions and from linear combinations of PAs are identical. Finally, a strong correlation, r(17) = 0.92, p < 0.001, was observed between the cycle-to-cycle variability in PA1 and the LyE calculated for PP1, supporting the notion that PA variability and LyE share some of the information they provide about movement control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Strength is often estimated from stiffness, but it is not known whether the relationship between stiffness and strength varies with age and sex. Cadaveric proximal femurs (44 Male: 18-78 years; 40 Female: 24-95 years) and radial (36 Male: 18-89 years; 19 Female: 24-95 years) and femoral diaphyses (34 Male: 18-89 years; 19 Female: 24-95 years) were loaded to failure to evaluate how the stiffness-strength relationship varies with age and sex. Strength correlated significantly with stiffness at all sites and for both sexes, as expected. However, females exhibited significantly less strength for the proximal femur (58% difference, p < 0.001). Multivariate regressions revealed that stiffness, age and PYD were significant negative independent predictors of strength for the proximal femur (Age: M: p = 0.005, F: p < 0.001, PYD: M: p = 0.022, F: p = 0.025), radial diaphysis (Age: M = 0.055, PYD: F = 0.024), and femoral diaphysis (Age: M: p = 0.014, F: p = 0.097, PYD: M: p = 0.003, F: p = 0.091).

It is currently unclear what soft-tissue stabilizers contribute to upper cervical motion in the setting of a Type II odontoid fracture, and evaluation of how concomitant injury contributes to cervical stability may inform surgical decision-making as well as allow for the creation of future, accurate, biomechanical models of the upper cervical spine. The objective of the current study was to determine the contribution of soft-tissue stabilizers in the upper cervical spine following a Type II odontoid fracture. Eight cadaveric C0-C2 specimens were evaluated using a robotic testing system with motion tracking. The unilateral facet capsule (UFC) and anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) were serially resected to determine their biomechanical role following odontoid fracture. Range of motion (ROM) and moment at the end of intact specimen replay were the primary outcomes. We determined that fracture of the odontoid significantly increases motion and decreases resistance to intact motion for flexion-extension (FE), axial rotation (AR), and lateral bending (LB). Injury to the UFC increased AR by 3.2° and FE by 3.2°. ALL resection did not significantly increase ROM or decrease end-point moment. The UFC was determined to contribute to 19% of intact flexion resistance and 24% of intact AR resistance.

The proposed mechanism by which they reduce KAM is a lateral shift in foot center of pressure (COP) and a consequent shortening of the knee lever arm (KLA), thereby reducing KAM, which can be simply calculated as KLA multiplied by the frontal plane ground reaction force (FP-GRF). The present study investigated this mechanism for a unique biomechanical device capable of shifting COP by means of moveable convex elements attached to the shoe. Fourteen healthy young male subjects underwent gait analysis in two COP configurations of the device for comparison: (1) laterally and (2) medially deviated. Average midstance KLA and KAM were decreased by 8.2% and 8.7%, respectively, in the lateral COP compared to medial. Ground reaction force parameters, frontal plane knee angle (FP-KA), and spine lateral flexion angle (SLF) did not differ between COP configurations. No study parameters differed for terminal stance. Linear mixed effects models showed that COP and FP-GRF components, but not FP-KA and SLF, were significant predictors of KLA. In addition, KLA and FP-GRF were significant predictors of KAM; although, FP-GRF did not change significantly with medio-lateral COP shift, while KLA did. This suggests that the mechanism by which the study device reduces KAM is primarily through shortening of KLA brought on by a lateral shift in COP.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

OpenSim models are typically based on cadaver findings that are generalized to represent a wide range of populations, which curbs their validity. Patient-specific modelling through incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves the model's biofidelity with respect to joint alignment and articulations, muscle wrapping, and ligament insertions. The purpose of this study was to determine if the inclusion of an MRI-based knee model would elicit differences in lower limb kinematics and resulting knee ligament lengths during a side cut task.


METHODS
Eleven participants were analyzed with the popular Rajagopal OpenSim model, two variations of the same model to include three and six degrees of freedom knee (DOF), and a fourth version featuring a four DOF MRI-based knee model. These four models were used in an inverse kinematics analysis of a side cut task and the resulting lower limb kinematics and knee ligament lengths were analyzed.


RESULTS
The MRI-based model was more responsive to the movement task than the original Rajagopal model while less susceptible to soft tissue artifact than the unconstrained six DOF model. Ligament isometry was greatest in the original Rajagopal model and smallest in the six DOF model.


CONCLUSIONS
When using musculoskeletal modelling software, one must acutely consider the model choice as the resulting kinematics and ligament lengths are dependent on this decision. The MRI-based knee model is responsive to the kinematics and ligament lengths of highly dynamic tasks and may prove to be the most valid option for continuing with late-stage modelling operations such as static optimization.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a widely employed model to mimic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Available data regarding LPS-induced biomechanical changes on pulmonary epithelial cells are limited only to P. aeruginosa LPS. Considering that LPS from different bacteria could promote a specific mechanical response in epithelial cells, we aim to assess the effect of E. coli LPS, widely employed as a model of ARDS, in the biomechanics of alveolar epithelial cells.


METHODS
Young's modulus (E) of alveolar epithelial cells (A549) was measured by atomic force microscopy every 5 min throughout 60 min of experiment after treatment with LPS from E. coli (100 μg/mL). The percentage of cells presenting actin stress fibers (F-actin staining) was also evaluated. Control cells were treated with culture medium and the values obtained were compared with LPS-treated cells for each time-point.


RESULTS
Application of LPS induced significant increase in E after 20 min (77%) till 60 min (104%) in comparison to controls. Increase in lung epithelial cell stiffness induced by LPS was associated with a higher number of cells presenting cytoskeletal remodeling.


CONCLUSIONS
The observed effects of E. coli LPS on alveolar epithelial cells suggest that this widely-used LPS is able to promote a quick formation of actin stress fibers and stiffening cells, thereby facilitating the disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Children with cerebral palsy (CP) frequently have reduced plantarflexion function, which is commonly attributed to impaired muscle structure and function, however little attention has been paid to the potential contribution of ATMA geometry. The use of musculoskeletal modelling for the simulation of gait and understanding of gait mechanics, rely on accuracy of ATMA estimates. This study aimed to compare 3D in-vivo estimates of ATMA of adults, children with CP and typically developing (TD) children, as well as compare 3D in-vivo estimates to linearly scaled musculoskeletal model estimates. MRI scans for eight children with CP, 11 TD children and nine healthy adults were used to estimate in-vivo 3D ATMA using a validated method. A lower limb musculoskeletal model was linearly scaled to individual tibia length to provide a scaled ATMA estimate. Normalised in-vivo 3D ATMA for children with CP was 17.2% ± 2.0 tibia length, which was significantly larger than for TD children (15.2% ± 1.2, p = 0.013) and adults (12.5% ± 0.8, p < 0.001). Scaled ATMA estimates from musculoskeletal models significantly underestimated in-vivo estimates for all groups, by up to 34.7%. The results of this study show children with CP have larger normalised 3D ATMA compared to their TD counterparts, which may have implications in understanding reduced plantarflexor function and the efficacy of surgical interventions whose aim is to modify the musculoskeletal geometry of this muscle group.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These tasks elicit high energetic costs through increased positive work generated by knee and ankle muscles, which may increase risk of muscular fatigue and decrease combat readiness. This study aimed to determine how modifying where load is borne changes lower-limb joint mechanical work production, and if load magnitude and/or walking speed also affect work production. Twenty Australian soldiers participated, donning a total of 12 body armor variations: six different body armor systems (one standard-issue, two commercially available [cARM1-2], and three prototypes [pARM1-3]), each worn with two different load magnitudes (15 and 30 kg). For each armor variation, participants completed treadmill walking at two speeds (1.51 and 1.83 m/s). Three-dimensional motion capture and force plate data were acquired and used to estimate joint angles and moments from inverse kinematics and dynamics, respectively. Subsequently, hip, knee, and ankle joint work and power were computed and compared between armor types and walking speeds. Positive joint work over the stance phase significantly increased with walking speed and carried load, accompanied by 2.3-2.6% shifts in total positive work production from the ankle to the hip (p < 0.05). Compared to using cARM1 with 15 kg carried load, carrying 30 kg resulted in significantly greater hip contribution to total lower-limb positive work, while knee and ankle work decreased. Substantial increases in hip joint contributions to total lower-limb positive work that occur with increases in walking speed and load magnitude highlight the importance of hip musculature to load carriage walking.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The paper aims at studying the mechanical properties (the Young's modulus, median and RMS roughness of friction force maps; fractal dimension, lacunarity and spatial distribution parameters of lateral force maps) of the cell surface layer of the erythrocytes of two different morphologies (discocytes and spherocytes) in HS using atomic force microscopy. The results of spatial-spectral and fractal analysis showed that the mechanical property maps of the HS spherocyte surface were more structurally homogeneous compared to the maps of HS discocytes. HS spherocytes also had a reduced RMS roughness and lacunarity of the mechanical property maps. The Young's modulus and averaged friction forces over the microscale HS spherocyte surface regions were approximately 20% higher than that of HS discocytes. The revealed significant difference at the nano- and microscales in the structural and mechanical properties of main (discoidal and spheroidal) morphological types of HS erythrocytes can potentially cause blood flow disturbance in the vascular system in HS.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This heterogeneity has been observed in many cell populations and with several measurement techniques but the sources are not yet fully understood. Cell mechanical properties are directly related to the composition and organization of the cytoskeleton, which is physically coupled to neighboring cells through adherens junctions and to underlying matrix through focal adhesion complexes. This high level of heterogeneity may be attributed to varying cellular interactions throughout the sample. We tested the effect of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions on the mechanical properties of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in culture by using antibodies to block N-cadherin and integrin β1 interactions. VSMCs were cultured on substrates of varying stiffness with and without tension. Under each of these conditions, cellular mechanical properties were characterized by performing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cellular structure was analyzed through immunofluorescence imaging. As expected, VSMC mechanical properties were greatly affected by the underlying culture substrate and applied tension. Interestingly, the cell-to-cell variation in mechanical properties within each sample decreased significantly in the antibody conditions. Thus, the cells grown with blocking antibodies were more homogeneous in their mechanical properties on both glass and soft substrates. This suggests that diversified adhesion binding between cells and the ECM is responsible for a significant amount of mechanical heterogeneity that is observed in 2D cell culture studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Alignment and resistance are two factors that are tunable in articulated AFOs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of changing AFO ankle alignment on lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics with constant dorsiflexion and plantarflexion resistance in individuals post-stroke. Gait analysis was performed on 10 individuals post-stroke under four distinct alignment conditions using an articulated AFO with an ankle joint whose alignment is adjustable in the sagittal plane. Kinematic and kinetic data of lower limb joints were recorded using a Vicon 3-dimensional motion capture system and Bertec split-belt instrumented treadmill. The incremental changes in the alignment of the articulated AFO toward dorsiflexion angles significantly affected ankle and knee joint angles and knee joint moments while walking in individuals post-stroke. No significant differences were found in the hip joint parameters. The alignment of the articulated AFO was suggested to play an important role in improving knee joint kinematics and kinetics in stance through improvement of ankle joint kinematics while walking in individuals post-stroke. Future studies should investigate long-term effects of AFO alignment on gait in the community in individuals post-stroke.,True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Within a split-belt treadmill paradigm, sagittal plane feedback improves adaptation but does not affect retention. Representation of error in this manner is cognitively demanding. However, it is unknown in this paradigm how frontal plane feedback, which may utilize a unique learning process, impacts locomotor adaptation. Frontal plane movement feedback has been shown to impact retention of novel running mechanics but has yet to be evaluated in gait conditions widely applicable within neurorehabilitation, such as walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of frontal plane mirror feedback on gait adaptation and retention during split-belt treadmill walking. Forty healthy young adults were divided into two groups: one group received mirror feedback during the first split-belt exposure and the other received no mirror feedback. Individuals in the mirror feedback group were asked to look at their legs in the mirror, but no further instructions were given. Individuals with mirror feedback displayed more symmetric stance time during the first strides of adaptation and maintained this pattern into the second split-belt exposure when no feedback was provided. Individuals with mirror feedback also demonstrated more symmetric double support time upon returning to normal walking. Lastly, the mirror feedback also allowed individuals to walk with smaller gait variability during the final steps of both split-belt exposures. Overall, mirror feedback allowed individuals to reduce their stance time asymmetry and led to a more consistent adapted pattern, suggesting this type of feedback may have utility in gait training that targets symmetry and consistency in movement.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lumbar lordosis (LL) and the range of motion (RoM) are important physiological measurements when initiating any diagnosis and treatment plan for patients with low back pain. Numerous studies reported differences in LL and the RoM due to age and sex. However, these findings remain contradictory. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to synthesize mean values and the differences in LL and the RoM because of age and sex. The quality assessment tool for quantitative studies was applied to assess the methodological quality of the studies included. We identified 2372 papers through electronic (2309) and physical (63) searches. We assessed 218 full-text studies reporting measurements of LL or the RoM. In total, 65 studies were included, and a normative database for LL and the RoM is provided as supplementary material. Among these, 11 were included in the meta-analysis. LL and the RoM displayed non-monotonic variations with significant age and sex differences. Young females showed a significantly greater LL and the range of extension (RoE), whereas young males exhibited a greater range of flexion (RoF). Sex differences in the range of lateral bending (RoLB) were small but were significant for the axial rotation (RoAR). For the RoF, RoE and RoLB, differences because of age were significant among most of the age groups in both sexes, whereas for the RoAR, differences were significant only between the 20s vs the 30s-40s (males) and 40s vs 50s (females). Significant differences because of age/sex were identified. However, the age-dependent reduction in LL and the RoM was non-monotonic and differed in both sexes.

Depth-dependent proteoglycan (PG) content, collagen content and collagen orientation in the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM), and PG content in the pericellular matrix (PCM) were assessed with microscopic and spectroscopic methods. Patellar, femoral groove and samples from both the lateral and medial compartments of the femoral condyle and tibial plateau were extracted from healthy controls and from the partial meniscectomy group. For both groups and each knee joint site, axisymmetric FE models with measured properties were generated. Experimental cartilage loading was applied in the simulations and chondrocyte volumes were compared to the experimental values. ECM and PCM PG loss occurred within the superficial cartilage layer in the PM group at all locations, except in the lateral tibial plateau. Collagen content and orientation were not significantly altered due to the PM. The FE simulations predicted similar chondrocyte volume changes and group differences as obtained experimentally. Loss of PCM fixed charge density (FCD) decreased cell volume loss, as observed in the medial femur and medial tibia, whereas loss of ECM FCD increased cell volume loss, as seen in the patella, femoral groove and lateral femur.

Mechanically-assisted crevice corrosion of modular tapers continues to be a concern in total joint replacements. Surgical factors that may affect taper seating mechanics include seating load magnitude and load orientation. Seating mechanics is defined as the seating load versus displacement behavior. In this study, mixed-alloy (CoCrMo/Ti-6Al-4V) modular head-neck 5°40' taper junctions were seated over a range of axially-oriented loads and off-axis orientations, capturing load-displacement during seating. The goals of the study were to assess the effects of seating load magnitude and load orientation on seating mechanics and correlate those findings with the taper pull-off load.


METHODS
A testing fixture measured head-neck seating displacement as the load was quasistatically applied. Motion was captured using two non-contact differential variable reluctance transducers which were mounted to the neck targeting the head. Seating experiments ranged from 1000 N to 8000 N. Load orientation ranged from 0° to 20° at 4000 N.


RESULTS
Seating load-displacement behavior at different seating loads showed a consistent characteristic behavior. Testing demonstrated increased seating displacement with seating load. Pull-off loads increased with seating load and were approximately 44% of the seating load across the range of seating loads investigated. Seating load orientation up to 20° had no significant effect on seating displacement and taper pull-off load.


CONCLUSION
Increased seating load magnitude increased seating displacement, work of seating and pull-off loads in mixed-alloy 5°40' head-neck tapers. Altering load orientation up to 20° off-axis had no significant effect.

This study systematically investigated the variables associated with the elastic foundation contact model within OpenSim by performing a series of controlled benchtop experiment and concomitant simulations. Four metal-on-plastic interactions were modeled, including a model of a total knee replacement (TKR). Load-displacement curves were recorded during cyclic loading between 100 and 750 N. Geometries were imported and into OpenSim and contact mechanics were modeled with the on-board elastic foundation algorithm. A hybrid optimization algorithm determined that stiffness and dissipation coefficients for TKR implants were 1.52 × 1010 N/m and 57.7 Ns/m, respectively. Estimations of contact forces were 10.2% of blinded experimental data (average root mean square error: 76.82 ± 11.47 N). In the second portion of this study, freely available eTibia TKR renderings were used to test the ubiquity of the tuning parameters. They were also used to perform a sensitivity analysis of material stiffness and mesh density with regard to penetration depth and computational time. When a stiffness of 1 × 1010 was applied to an eTibia model with 5000 faces, a 100 kg load caused 0.259 mm of penetration. Under the same conditions, the tuned model experienced 0.300 mm of penetration. Material stiffnesses between 1 × 1013 and 1 × 1015 N/m increased computation time by factors of 12-23.

The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate an instrumentation strategy for an ultrasound system to measure probe forces and orientation during freehand imaging to characterize the interaction between the probe and soft-tissue as well as enhance repeatability. The instrumentation included a 6-axis load cell, an inertial measurement unit, and an optional sensor for camera-based motion capture. A known method for compensation of the ultrasound probe weight was implemented, and a novel method for temporal synchronization was developed. While load and optical sensing was previously achieved, this paper presents a strategy for potential instrumentation on a variety of ultrasound machines. A key feature was the temporal synchronization, utilizing the electrocardiogram (EKG) feature built-in to the ultrasound. The system was used to perform anatomical imaging of tissue layers of musculoskeletal extremities and imaging during indentation on an in vivo subject and an in vitro specimen. The outcomes of the instrumentation strategy were demonstrated during minimal force and indentation imaging. In short, the system presented robust instrumentation of an existing ultrasound system to fully characterize the probe force, orientation, and optionally its movement during imaging while efficiently synchronizing all data.

Numerous biomechanical studies have addressed normal shoulder function and the factors that affect it. While these investigations include a mix of in-vivo clinical reports, ex-vivo cadaveric studies, and computer-based simulations, each has its own strengths and limitations. A robust methodology is essential in cadaveric work but does not always come easily. Precise quantitative measurements are difficult in in-vivo studies, and simulation studies require validation steps. This review focuses on ex-vivo cadaveric studies to emphasize the best research methodologies available to simulate physiologically and clinically relevant shoulder motion.


METHODS
A PubMed and Web of Science search was conducted in March 2017 (and updated in May 2018) to identify the cadaveric studies focused on the shoulder and its function. The key words for this search included rotator cuff (RC) injuries, RC surgery, and their synonyms. The protocol of the study was registered on PROSPERO and is accessible at CRD42017068873.


RESULTS
Thirty one studies consisting of 167 specimens with various biomechanical methods met our inclusion criteria. All studies were level V cadaveric studies. Cadaveric biomechanical models are widely used to study shoulder instability and RC repair. These models are commonly limited to the glenohumeral joint by a fixed scapula, passively and discretely move the humerus, and statically load the RC without regard for the integrity of the glenohumeral capsule.


CONCLUSION
All studies captured in this review evaluated shoulder biomechanics. Recent studies in patients suggest that some assumptions made in this space may not fully characterize motion of the human shoulder. With reproducible scapular positioning, dynamic RC activation, and preservation of glenohumeral capsule integrity, cadaveric studies can facilitate proper validation for simulation models and broaden our understanding of the shoulder environment during motion in healthy and disease states.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study assessed the effect of a passive exoskeleton on back and abdominal muscle activation, hip and lumbar flexion and on the contribution of both the human and the exoskeleton to the L5/S1 net moment, during static bending at five different hand heights. Two configurations of the exoskeleton (LOW & HIGH) differing in angle-torque characteristics were tested. L5/S1 moments generated by the subjects were significantly reduced (15-20% for the most effective type) at all hand heights. LOW generated 4-11 Nm more support than HIGH at 50%, 25% and 0% upright stance hand height and HIGH generated 4-5 Nm more support than LOW at 100% and 75%. Significant reductions (11-57%) in back muscle activity were found compared to WITHOUT for both exoskeletons for some conditions. However, EMG reductions compared to WITHOUT were highly variable across subjects and not always significant. The device allowed for substantial lumbar bending (up to 70°) so that a number of participants showed the flexion-relaxation phenomenon, which prevented further reduction of back EMG by the device and even an increase from 2% to 6% MVC in abdominal activity at 25% hand height. These results indicate that flexion relaxation and its interindividual variation should be considered in future exoskeleton developments.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Both assistance techniques and a powered-off condition were compared in treadmill walking (1.5 m s-1) with a soft exosuit. We hypothesized that both techniques can result in a similar metabolic reduction when providing a similar level of average positive exosuit power at each ankle (0.12 W kg-1) and hip (0.02 W kg-1) while the underlying global center-of-mass and local joint biomechanics would be different. We found a similar net metabolic rate reduction of 15% relative to walking with the suit powered-off for both techniques. The ankle moment inspired technique showed larger magnitudes of reductions for biological moment and power at the hip and the ankle. The ankle power inspired technique might benefit from higher biological efficiency, when reducing positive instead of negative power at the knee and when almost keeping the isometric function of the plantarflexors before push-off. Changes at the ankle caused energetic reductions at the knee, hip and the center-of-mass. A major contribution to metabolic reduction might be based on them. As the lower limb biomechanics that led to these reductions were different, we believe that humans alter their gait to maximize their energetic benefit based on the exosuit assistance. For further insights on mechanisms that lead to metabolic reduction, joint mechanics and muscle-tendon dynamics must be analyzed in combination.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Comprehension of these valvular diseases is reliant on thorough characterization of healthy heart valve structures for use in computational models. Previously, computational models have treated these leaflet structures as a structurally and mechanically homogenous material, which may not be an accurate description of leaflet mechanical response. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mechanics of the heart valve leaflet as a structurally heterogenous material. Specifically, porcine mitral valve and tricuspid valve anterior leaflets were sectioned into six regions and biaxial mechanical tests with various loading ratios and stress-relaxation test were performed on each regional tissue sample. Three main findings from this study were summarized as follows: (i) the central regions of the leaflet had a more anisotropic nature than edge regions, (ii) the mitral valve anterior leaflet was more extensible in regions closer to the annulus, and (iii) there was variance in the stress-relaxation behavior among all six regions, with mitral valve leaflet tissue regions exhibiting a greater decay than the tricuspid valve regions. This study presents a novel investigation of the regional variations in the heart valve biomechanics that has not been comprehensively examined. Our results thus allow for a refinement of computational models for more accurately predicting diseased or surgically-intervened condition, where tissue heterogeneity plays an essential role in the heart valve function.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Secondly, this study compared the shear modulus between the quadriceps muscles, in both proximal and distal regions. Twelve healthy individuals were assessed during a passive knee flexion maneuver between 0° and 90° of knee flexion with the hip in two positions: flexed (80°) vs. neutral (0°). Muscle electrical activity was also assessed during the testing. No differences were observed between the hip testing positions for myoelectric activity (p > 0.43), and for VL and VM shear modulus (p = 0.12-0.98). Similarly, there were no differences between the proximal and distal regions for all muscles (p = 0.42-0.93). RF showed a higher shear modulus with the hip in the neutral position (p = 0.004). With the hip flexed, the VL showed the greatest shear modulus among the tested muscles (p < 0.025); while with the hip in the neutral position, no differences were observed for shear modulus between VL and RF (p = 0.817). These findings suggest that epimuscular myofascial force transmission (at a muscle belly level) does not occur between the quadriceps muscles when passively flexing the knee until 90°. Whether epimuscular myofascial force transmission occurs in the quadriceps muscles bellies with greater muscle stretch (either through knee flexion or hip extension) remains to be examined.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Accordingly, we developed a new technique for assessing bone healing using virtual mechano-structural analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans from 19 fractured human tibiae at 12 weeks after surgery were segmented and prepared for finite element analysis (FEA). Boundary conditions were applied to the models to simulate a torsion test that is commonly used to access the structural integrity of long bones in animal models of fracture healing. The output of each model was the virtual torsional rigidity (VTR) of the healing zone, normalized to the torsional rigidity of each patient's virtually reconstructed tibia. This provided a structural measure to track the percentage of healing each patient had undergone. Callus morphometric measurements were also collected from the CT scans. Results showed that at 12 weeks post-op, more than 75% of patients achieved a normalized VTR (torsional rigidity relative to uninjured bone) of 85% or above. The predicted intact torsional rigidities compared well with published cadaveric data. Across all patients, callus volume and density were weakly and non-significantly correlated with normalized VTR and time to clinical union. Conversely, normalized VTR was significantly correlated with time to union (R2 = 0.383, p = 0.005). This suggests that fracture scoring methods based on the visual appearance of callus may not accurately predict mechanical integrity. The image-based structural analysis presented here may be a useful technique for assessment of bone healing in orthopaedic trauma research.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The CFD method was used to investigate the detailed flow field around the cyclist/bicycle system for a constant speed of 11.1 m/s (40 km/h) without wind. In complement, a mathematical model was used to determine the temperature-dependent power output in the range [-10; 40 °C]. The numerical investigation gives valuable information about the turbulent flow field in the cyclist's wake which evolves accordingly the surrounding temperature. A major result of this study is that the areas of overpressure upstream of the cyclist and of underpressure downstream of him are less extensive for a temperature of 40 °C compared to -10 °C. The results suggest that the aerodynamic braking effect of the bicycle is minimized when the air temperature is high, as a lower air density results in a reduction in drag on the cyclist. This study showed that the power required to maintain a constant speed is reduced when the temperature is high, the reason being a lower aerodynamic resistance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thus, the aims of this study were to analyze the reliability of a posturography protocol to assess TC in adults with CP, and quantify their degree of TC impairment compared to a control sample of adults without CP. Forty-seven adults with moderate-to-severe CP and nineteen control participants were assessed via a protocol of static and dynamic seated trunk tasks, performed on a stable and an unstable surface placed on a force-plate. The mean radial error was the primary variable measured. A large percentage of CP participants successfully completed the static and dynamic conditions on the stable surface (static: 93.6%; dynamic: 91.5-72.3%); however, this percentage decreased considerably on the unstable surface (51.1-34.0%). The posturography protocol displayed good reliability in adults with CP (0.89 ≤ ICC ≤ 0.95; 15.2% ≤ SEM ≤ 20.7%). Adults with CP displayed significantly decreased TC in 4/5 tasks on the stable seat, particularly in dynamic conditions (1.71 ≤ dg ≤ 1.91). Our results confirmed that TC is significantly affected in CP adults compared with controls without CP of similar age, but they present more difficulties to perform dynamic tasks. Thus, it would be recommend including dynamic in addition to static conditions to obtain a comprehensive assessment of TC impairment in adults with moderate-to-severe CP. Additional, these results encourage practitioners to design dynamic activities that challenge trunk control for rehabilitations/training programs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, patient specific finite element (FE) models were used to assess changes in primary stability due to variability in patient anatomy, bone properties and stem alignment for two commonly used cementless femoral stems, Corail® and Summit® (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, USA). Computed-tomography images of the femur were obtained for 8 males and 8 females. An automated algorithm was used to determine the stem position and size which minimized the endo-cortical space, and then span the plausible surgical envelope of implant positions constrained by the endo-cortical boundary. A total of 1952 models were generated and ran, each with a unique alignment scenario. Peak hip contact and muscle forces for stair climbing were scaled to the donor's body weight and applied to the model. The primary stability was assessed by comparing the implant micromotion and peri-prosthetic strains to thresholds (150 μm and 7000 µε, respectively) above which fibrous tissue differentiation and bone damage are expected to prevail. Despite the wide range of implant positions included, FE prediction were mostly below the thresholds (medians: Corail®: 20-74 µm and 1150-2884 µε, Summit®: 25-111 µm and 860-3010 µε), but sensitivity of micromotion and interfacial strains varied across femora, with the majority being sensitive (p < 0.0029) to average bone mineral density, cranio-caudal angle, post-implantation anteversion angle and lateral offset of the femur.

The present study investigated the influence of tissue microarchitecture, tissue heterogeneity in elasticity and material separation properties and tissue-level anisotropy on the microcrack formation process. Microscale bone models were executed with the extended finite element method.

The aim of this study was to investigate vertical CoM displacement (and step length as a potential underpinning factor) as an explanatory factor in the previously observed increased CoW with diabetes. Thirty-one non-diabetic controls (Ctrl); 22 diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy (DM) and 14 patients with moderate/severe Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), underwent gait analysis using a motion analysis system and force plates while walking at a range of matched speeds between 0.6 and 1.6 m/s. Vertical displacement of the CoM was measured over the gait cycle, and was not different in either diabetes patients with or without diabetic peripheral neuropathy compared to controls across the range of matched walking speeds examined (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 5.59 (SD: 1.6), DM: 5.41 (1.63), DPN: 4.91 (1.66) cm; p > 0.05). The DPN group displayed significantly shorter steps (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 69, DM: 67, DPN: 64 cm; p > 0.05) and higher cadence (at 1 m/s: Ctrl: 117 (SD1.12), DM: 119 (1.08), DPN: 122 (1.25) steps per minute; p > 0.05) across all walking speeds compared to controls. The vertical CoM displacement is therefore unlikely to be a factor in itself that contributes towards the higher CoW observed recently in people with diabetic neuropathy. The higher CoW in patients with diabetes may not be explained by the CoM displacement, but rather may be more related to shorter step lengths, increased cadence and the associated increased internal work and higher muscle forces developed by walking with more flexed joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While effectively summarizing overall difference, MSE fails to capture localized, one-sided errors. This paper describes how smoothing noisy 1D data using a variety of algorithms can introduce systematic bias, and quantifies this bias using the false positive rate (FPR): the probability that a smoothing algorithm will yield a dataset whose 1D mean differs significantly from its true 1D datum. A simulation study was conducted involving six 1D datum continua, and four smoothing algorithms whose parameters were systematically manipulated along with sample size and noise amplitude. Approximately ten million simulation iterations were evaluated. FPRs were calculated at α=0.05, based on the calculated smoothness of the resulting datasets. Results showed that FPRs were much higher than the expected value of α, and in many cases approached 100%. FPRs were highest with aggressive smoothing parameters, large sample sizes and small noise amplitudes, irrespective of both smoothing algorithm and the 1D datum. These results suggest that smoothing 1D biomechanical data can introduce statistical bias with relatively high probability. The implications are experiment-specific because the biomechanical meaning of 1D changes can vary vastly between datasets. Smoothing-induced bias should be a cause for general concern when small 1D changes have non-trivial biomechanical consequences.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This paper describes how Bayesian inference can contrastingly be used to maximize the probability that a given stochastic kinematic model would produce the observed marker positions. We developed Bayesian IK for two planar IK applications: (1) kinematic chain posture estimates using an explicit forward kinematics model, and (2) rigid body rotation estimates using implicit kinematic modeling through marker displacements. We then tested and compared Bayesian IK results to LS results in Monte Carlo simulations in which random marker error was introduced using Gaussian noise amplitudes ranging uniformly between 0.2 mm and 2.0 mm. Results showed that Bayesian IK was more accurate than LS-IK in over 92% of simulations, with the exception of one center-of-rotation coordinate planar rotation, for which Bayesian IK was more accurate in only 68% of simulations. Moreover, while LS errors increased with marker noise, Bayesian errors were comparatively unaffected by noise amplitude. Nevertheless, whereas the LS solutions required average computational durations of less than 0.5 s, average Bayesian IK durations ranged from 11.6 s for planar rotation to over 2000 s for kinematic chain postures. These results suggest that Bayesian IK can yield order-of-magnitude IK improvements for simple planar IK, but also that its computational demands may make it impractical for some applications.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This approach to predict the fractional flow reserve (FFR) is shown to have a high diagnostic accuracy when comparing against invasively measured FFR. However, one of the main drawbacks is the high computational effort needed for preprocessing and computations. Hence, uncertainty quantification may become unfeasible. Reduction of complexity is desirable, computationally inexpensive models with high diagnostic accuracy are preferred. We present a parametric comparison study for three types of CFD models (2D axisymmetric, Semi-3D and 3D) in which we study the impact of model reduction on three models on the predicted FFR. In total 200 coronary geometries were generated for seven geometrical characteristics e.g. stenosis severity, stenosis length and vessel curvature. The effect of time-averaged flow was investigated using unsteady, mean steady and a root mean square (RMS) steady flow. The 3D unsteady model was regarded as reference model. Results show that when using an unsteady or RMS flow, predicted FFR hardly varies between models contrary to using average flows. The 2D model with RMS flow has a high diagnostic accuracy (0.99), reduces computational time by a factor 162,000 and the introduced model error is well below the clinical relevant differences. Stenosis severity, length, curvature and tapering cause most discrepancies when using a lower order model. An uncertainty analysis showed that this can be explained by the low variability that is caused by variations in stenosis asymmetry.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This work proposes a link between the mechanical testing and the material model predictions through histological data of vaginal tissue. Histological data was used to link tensile testing experiments with material-dependent parameters; the approach was adequate to capture the nonlinear response of ovine vaginal tissue over a large strain range. The experimental data obtained on a previous study, has two main components: tensile testing and histological analysis of the ovine vaginal tissue. Uniaxial tensile test data and histological data were collected from three sheep groups: virgins, pregnant and parous. The distal part of vaginal wall was selected since it is prone to tears induced by vaginal delivery. The HGO (Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden) model parameters were fitted using a stochastic approach, namely the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA). The SGA was able to fit the experimental data successfully (R2 > 0.986). The dimensionless coefficient ξ, was highly correlated with histological data. The ratio was seen to increase linearly with increasing collagen content. Coefficient ξ brings a new way of interpreting and understanding experimental data; it connects the nonlinear mechanical behaviour (tensile test) with tissue's morphology (histology). It can be used as an 'inverse' (approximate) method to estimate the mechanical properties without direct experimental measurements, through basic histology. In this context, the proposed methodology appears very promising in estimating the response of the tissue via histological information.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

No known work has investigated the interface force between the vibrating plate of the machine and the human body. This paper investigates the effect of bending the knees and the vibration frequency on the interface force (presented as apparent mass (AM)) between the vibrating plate and the body. Twelve male subjects stood with four different knee angles (180, 165, 150 and 135°) and were exposed to sinusoidal vertical vibration at eight frequencies in the range of 17-42 Hz. The vertical acceleration and the interface force between the body and the vibrating plate were measured and used to calculate the AM. The acceleration and force depended on the frequency and were found to vary with both the adopted posture and subject. The AM generally decreased with increasing the frequency but showed a peak at 24 Hz which was clearer when the knees were bent. Bending the knees showed an effect similar to increasing the damping of a system with base excitation; increasing the damping reduced the AM in the resonance region but increased the AM at higher frequencies. Users of WBVTMs have to be careful when choosing the training posture: although, as shown in previous studies, bending the knees reduces the transmission of vibration to the spine, it increases the interface forces which might indicate increased stresses on the lower legs and joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Residual stress is defined as the stress that remains in a tissue when all external loads are removed and contributes to tissue mechanohomeostasis by decreasing the transmural gradient of wall stress. Current computational models of pelvic floor mechanics, however, often do not consider residual stress. Residual strain, a result of residual stress can be quantitatively measured through opening angle experiments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to quantify the regional variations in opening angles along the murine female reproductive system at estrus and diestrus, to quantify residual strain in the maintenance state of sexually mature females. Further, evidence suggests that hydrophilic glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycans are integral to cervical remodeling. Thus, variations in opening angles following hypo-osmotic loading are evaluated. Opening angle experiments were performed along the murine reproductive system in estrus (n = 8) and diestrus (n = 8) and placed in hypo-osmotic solution. Measurements of thickness and volume were also obtained for each group. Differences (p < 0.05) in opening angle were observed with respect to region and loading, however, differences with respect to estrous stage were not significant. Thickness values were significant (p < 0.05) with respect to region only. The effects of both estrous cycle and region resulted in significant differences (p < 0.05) in observed volume. The observed regional differences indicate variation in the stress-free state among the reproductive system which may have implications for future computational models to advance women's reproductive health.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous work has suggested that lateral protective stepping during weight transfer may be affected by impaired muscle composition and performance of the hip abductors (AB) in older adults. Hence, this study investigated the influence of hip abductor-adductor (AB-AD) neuromuscular performance on the weight transfer phase of lateral protective stepping in younger and older adults. Healthy younger (n = 15) and older adults (n = 15) performed hip AB-AD isometric maximal voluntary contractions (IMVC). Lateral balance perturbations were applied via motorized waist-pulls. Participants were instructed to recover their balance using a single lateral step. Kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) data were analyzed during the weight transfer phase. In the hip IMVC task, older adults showed reduced peak AB-AD torque, AB rate of torque development and AB-AD rate of EMG neuromuscular activation (RActv). During the lateral balance perturbations, older individuals had a lower incidence of lateral steps, reduced hip AB-AD RActv and delayed weight transfer. However, several outcomes were larger in the older group, such as, center of mass momentum at step onset, step-side peak rate of vertical force development, hip AB net joint torque, and power. Although older adults had greater hip muscular output during the weight transfer phase, their lateral balance recovery was still impaired. The reduced maximal hip AB-AD capacity, especially RActv, may have been a greater contributor to this impairment, as it affects the ability to generate rapid force, crucial for balance recovery.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

T1rho relaxation times are negatively correlated with proteoglycan concentration. Cartilage compresses in response to load, resulting in water exudation, a relative increase in proteoglycan concentration, and a decrease in the corresponding T1rho relaxation times. To date, there is limited information on changes in cartilage composition resulting from daily activity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify changes in tibial cartilage T1rho relaxation times in healthy human subjects following activities of daily living. It was hypothesized that water exudation throughout the day would lead to decreased T1rho relaxation times. Subjects underwent MR imaging in the morning and afternoon on the same day and were free to go about their normal activities between scans. Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that tibial cartilage T1rho relaxation times significantly decreased (by 7%) over the course of the day with loading, which is indicative of a relative increase in proteoglycan concentration. Additionally, baseline T1rho values varied with position within the cartilage, supporting a need for site-specific measurements of T1rho relaxation times. Understanding how loading alters the proteoglycan concentration in healthy cartilage may hold clinical significance pertaining to cartilage homeostasis and potentially help to elucidate a mechanism for OA development. These results also indicate that future studies using T1rho relaxation times as an indicator of cartilage health should control the loading history prior to image acquisition to ensure the appropriate interpretation of the data.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Mood phases for individuals with bipolar disorder were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale. We collected motion data using a 16-camera motion capture technology. We found smaller COM-ankle inclination angles at seat-off during sit-to-walk for the bipolar-depressed group compared to the bipolar-euthymic and healthy groups, indicating poorly controlled balance for the bipolar-depressed group in sit-to-walk. However, we found larger COM-ankle inclination angles at beginning of single stance phase of gait for the bipolar-euthymic group compared to the healthy group, indicating well controlled balance for the bipolar-euthymic group in gait.

Using a musculoskeletal modelling approach, muscle function was determined by computing the muscle contributions to the GRFs and lower-limb joint moments. We found that bodyweight support (vertical GRF) was primarily provided by the vasti, gluteus maximus, soleus and gastrocnemius. These same muscles, along with the hamstrings, were also primarily responsible for modulating braking and propulsion (anteroposterior GRF).

We investigated whether chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) affects skeletal muscle contractile properties at the cellular level. CRI was induced surgically in New Zealand rabbits (UREM), with sham-operation for controls (CON), and samples were collected at 3 months post-surgery, following euthanasia. All protocols had University Ethics approval following national and European guidelines. Sample treatments and evaluations were blinded. Maximal isometric force was assessed in 382 permeabilized psoas fibers (CON, n = 142, UREM, n = 240) initially at pH7, 10 °C ('standard' conditions), in subsets of fibers in acidic conditions (pH6.2, 10 °C) but also at near physiological temperature (pH7, 30 °C and pH6.2, 30 °C). CRI resulted in significant smaller average cross sectional areas (CSAs) by ∼11% for UREM muscle fibers (vs CON, P < 0.01). At standard conditions, UREM fibers produced lower absolute and specific forces (i.e. normalized force per fiber CSA) (vs CON, P < 0.01); force increased in 30 °C for both groups (P < 0.01), but the disparity between UREM and CON remained significant. Acidosis significantly reduced force (vs pH7, 10 °C P < 0.01), similarly in both groups (in UREM by -48% and in CON by -43%, P > 0.05). For the first time, we give evidence that CRI can induce significant impairments in single psoas muscle fibers force generation, only partly explained by fiber atrophy, thus affecting muscle mechanics at the cellular level.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The Lewinnek ""safe zone"" is often used in clinical routine. This safe zone does not consider functional aspects and dislocation can occur even when the cup is oriented within the safe zone. Functional safe zones based on the hip range of motion (ROM) were introduced but are not commonly used in clinical routine. The reason might be that these methods are time-consuming due to complex simulations. A relatively fast method based on analytical mathematical formulas was proposed, but it is difficult to consider arbitrary motion. This work introduces an efficient algorithm for calculating a patient-specific target zone based on the target ROM which can consider any set of motions. The method is based on matrix transformations and trigonometric formulas. The resulting target zone which contains all impingement-free cup orientations is dependent on the patient-specific pelvic tilt, the 3D angular neck and stem orientation within the femur, and the technical prosthesis ROM. This method could be integrated into computer-assisted preoperative planning and intra-operative navigation tools. As pelvic tilt and stem orientation influence the optimal cup orientation they need to be acquired from the patient to derive a patient-specific ROM-based target zone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In baseball and softball, catchers perform this squat an average of 146 times per nine-inning game. To alleviate some of the stress on their knees caused by this repetitive loading, some catchers wear foam knee supports.


OBJECTIVES
This work quantifies the effects of knee support on lower-body joint kinematics and kinetics in the deep squat position.


METHODS
Subjects in this study performed the deep squat with no support, foam support, and instrumented support. In order to measure the force through the knee support, instrumented knee supports were designed and fabricated. We then developed an inverse dynamic model to incorporate the support loads. From the model, joint angles and moments were calculated for the three conditions.


RESULTS
With support there is a significant reduction in the sagittal moment at the knee of 43% on the dominant side and 63% on the non-dominant side compared to without support. These reductions are a result of the foam supports carrying approximately 20% of body weight on each side.


CONCLUSION
Knee support reduces the moment necessary to generate the deep squat position common to baseball catchers. Given the short moment arm of the patella femoral tendon, even small changes in moment can have a large effect in the tibial-femoral contact forces, particularly at deep squat angles. Reducing knee forces may be effective in decreasing incidence of osteochondritis dissecans.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Understanding the changes in load-displacement at the ankle and subtalar joints after ligament injuries may detect specific changes in joint characteristics that cannot be detected by investigating changes in range of motion alone. The effect of restricting joints end range of motion with ankle braces was already established, but little is known about the effect of an ankle brace on the flexibility of the injured ankle and subtalar joints. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to (1) understand how flexibility is affected at the ankle and subtalar joints after sectioning lateral and intrinsic ligaments during combined sagittal foot position and inversion and during internal rotation and (2) investigate the effect of a semi-rigid ankle brace on the ankle and subtalar joint flexibility. Kinematics and kinetics were collected from nine cadaver feet during inversion through the range of ankle flexion and during internal rotation. Motion was applied with and without a brace on an intact foot and after sequentially sectioning the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) and the intrinsic ligaments. Segmental flexibility was defined as the slope of the angle-moment curve for each 1 Nm interval. Early flexibility significantly increased at the ankle and subtalar joint after CFL sectioning during inversion. The semi-rigid ankle brace significantly decreased early flexibility at the subtalar joint during inversion and internal rotation for all ligament conditions and at the ankle joint after all ligaments were cut.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recently, some studies demonstrated that the coordinated movement of lower limbs by kinematic synergy is important for stable walking. However, no study has been carried out to reveal the relation between falls and kinematic synergy, and it is unclear whether fall history alters the kinematic synergy. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the effects of fall history on kinematic synergy using uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis. Older adults were divided into two groups: older adults without fall history (non-fallers, n = 14) and older adults with fall history of at least one fall in the 12 months prior to the measurements (fallers, n = 10). Subjects walked at their own comfortable speed on a pathway and kinematic data were collected. UCM analysis was performed to assess how variability of segmental configurations in the frontal plane, the mediolateral and vertical directions, affects the frontal trajectory of the swing foot. Fallers had a greater variability of segmental configurations than non-fallers in all phases. In the mediolateral direction, the kinematic synergy in fallers was significantly greater than that in non-fallers during the early and late swing phases. On the other hands, fallers continuously had greater kinematic synergy compared to non-fallers in the vertical direction. The results revealed that fall history increased the kinematic synergy, although fallers needed a greater variability of segmental configurations as a compensatory strategy to ensure kinematic synergy.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contributions of altered material properties and geometry to free Achilles tendon stress distribution during a sub-maximal contraction in tendinopathic relative to healthy tendons. Tendinopathic (n = 8) and healthy tendons (n = 8) were imaged at rest and during a sub-maximal voluntary isometric contraction using three-dimensional freehand ultrasound. Images were manually segmented and used to create subject-specific finite element models. The resting cross-sectional area of the free tendon was on average 31% greater for the tendinopathic compared to healthy tendons. Material properties for each tendon were determined using a numerical parameter optimisation approach that minimised the difference in experimentally measured longitudinal strain and the strain predicted by the finite element model under submaximal loading conditions for each tendon. The mean Young's modulus for tendinopathic tendons was 53% lower than the corresponding control value. Finite element analyses revealed that tendinopathic tendons experience 24% less stress under the same submaximal external loading conditions compared to healthy tendons. The lower tendon stress in tendinopathy was due to a greater influence of tendon cross-sectional area, which alone reduced tendon stress by 30%, compared to a lower Young's modulus, which alone increased tendon stress by 8%. These findings suggest that the greater tendon cross-sectional area observed in tendinopathy compensates for the substantially lower Young's modulus, thereby protecting pathological tendon against excessive stress.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study presents the measurement of compliance of the soft tissues supporting the hip during impaction in operative conditions, and replicates these in vitro. Hip replacements were carried out on 4 full body cadavers while impact force traces and acetabular/femoral displacement were measured. Compliance was then simulated computationally using a Voigt model. These data were subsequently used to inform the design of a representative in-vitro drop rig.

Treatments that can restore normative cartilage loading patterns may mitigate the risk of osteoarthritis, though it is unclear whether such a goal is achievable through conservative rehabilitation. We used musculoskeletal simulation to predict cartilage and ligament loading patterns during walking in intact, ACL deficient, menisci deficient, and ACL-menisci deficient knees. Stochastic simulations with varying coordination strategies were then used to test whether neuromuscular control could be modulated to restore normative knee mechanics in the pathologic conditions. During early stance, a 3 mm increase in anterior tibial translation was predicted in the ACL deficient knee. Mean cartilage contact pressure increased by 18% and 24% on the medial and lateral plateaus, respectively, in the menisci deficient knee. Variations in neuromuscular coordination were insufficient to restore normative cartilage contact patterns in either the ACL or menisci deficient knees. Elevated cartilage contact pressures in the pathologic knees were observed in regions where cartilage wear patterns have previously been reported. These results suggest that altered cartilage tissue loading during gait may contribute to region-specific degeneration patterns, and that varying neuromuscular coordination in isolation is unlikely to restore normative knee mechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

GAGs provide structural basis for the organization and assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM). The mechanics of tissue with low GAG content can be indirectly affected by the interaction of GAGs with collagen fibers, which have long been known to be one of the primary contributors to soft tissue mechanics. Our earlier study showed that enzymatic GAG depletion results in straighter collagen fibers that are recruited at lower levels of stretch, and a corresponding shift in earlier arterial stiffening (Mattson et al., 2016). In this study, the effect of GAGs on collagen fiber recruitment was studied through a structure-based constitutive model. The model incorporates structural information, such as fiber orientation distribution, content, and recruitment of medial elastin, medial collagen, and adventitial collagen fibers. The model was first used to study planar biaxial tensile stress-stretch behavior of porcine descending thoracic aorta. Changes in elastin and collagen fiber orientation distribution, and collagen fiber recruitment were then incorporated into the model in order to predict the stress-stretch behavior of GAG depleted tissue. Our study shows that incorporating early collagen fiber recruitment into the model predicts the stress-stretch response of GAG depleted tissue reasonably well (rms = 0.141); considering further changes of fiber orientation distribution does not improve the predicting capability (rms = 0.149). Our study suggests an important role of GAGs in arterial mechanics that should be considered in developing constitutive models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Poor total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) hemodynamics have been hypothesized to be associated with long-term complications in Fontan patients. Image-based Fontan surgical planning has shown great potential as a clinical tool because it can pre-operatively evaluate patient-specific hemodynamics. Current surgical planning paradigms commonly utilize cardiac-gated phase contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to acquire vessel flows. These acquisitions are often taken under breath-held (BH) conditions and ignore the effect of respiration on blood flow waveforms. This study investigates the effect of respiration-driven flow waveforms on patient-specific hemodynamics using real-time MR acquisitions.


METHODS
Patient-specific TCPCs were reconstructed from cardiovascular MR images. Real-time phase contrast MR images were acquired under both free-breathing (FB) and breath-held conditions for 9 patients. Numerical simulations were employed to assess flow structures and hemodynamics used in Fontan surgical planning including hepatic flow distribution (HFD) and indexed power loss (iPL), which were then compared between FB and BH conditions.


RESULTS
Differences in TCPC flow structures between FB and BH conditions were observed throughout the respiratory cycle. However, the average differences (BH - FB values for each patient, which are then averaged) in iPL and HFD between these conditions were 0.002 ± 0.011 (p = 0.40) and 1 ± 3% (p = 0.28), respectively, indicating no significant difference in clinically important hemodynamic metrics.


CONCLUSIONS

The comparison of different time-varying three-dimensional hemodynamic data (4D) is a formidable task. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for a quantitative assessment.


METHODS
The complex spatial-temporal flow information was analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition to reduce the complexity of the system. PC-MRI blood flow measurements and computational fluid dynamic simulations of two subject-specific IAs were used to compare the different flow modalities. The concept of Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) provided a further detailed objective characterization of the most energetic individual modes.


RESULTS
The most energetic flow modes were qualitatively compared by visual inspection. The distribution of the kinetic energy on the modes was used to quantitatively compare pulsatile flow data, where the most energetic mode was associated to approximately 90% of the total kinetic energy. This distribution was incorporated in a single measure, termed spectral entropy, showing good agreement especially for Case 1.


CONCLUSION
The proposed quantitative POD-based technique could be a valuable tool to reduce the complexity of the time-dependent hemodynamic data and to facilitate an easy comparison of 4D flows, e.g., for validation purposes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We investigated these properties using a frequency response function, which evaluates the ratio between the measured and applied forces in the frequency domain. For comparison, the procedure was also performed on the gold-standard ground-embedded force platform. A predictive model of the systematic error of both types of force platform was then developed and tested against different input signals that represent three types of running patterns. Results show that the treadmill structure distorts the measured force signal. We then modified this structure with a simple stiffening frame in an attempt to reduce measurement error. Consequently, the overall absolute error was reduced (-22%), and the error in force-derived metrics was also sufficiently reduced: -68% for average loading rate error and -80% for impact peak error. Our procedure shows how to measure, predict, and reduce systematic dynamic error associated with treadmill-installed force platforms. We suggest this procedure should be implemented to appraise data quality, and frequency response function values should be included in research reports.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The TMJ disc plays a major role in TMJ disorders in people, but little is known about its role in TMJ pathology in animals. This study characterizes differences in properties of equine TMJ discs associated with age, disc region, and presence of TMJ osteoarthritis (OA). Discs were dissected from both TMJ's of sixteen horses euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. Each joint was grossly evaluated and scored as normal, mild OA, or severe OA. Samples from the rostral, caudal, lateral, central, and medial regions of the disc were subject to compressive testing, quantitative biochemistry, and histology. Samples from the lateral, central, and medial region were tested for tensile properties in the rostrocaudal and mediolateral directions. We found that the equine TMJ disc is highly anisotropic, and its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and compressive stiffness vary between disc regions. The disc also exhibits increasing GAG content and compressive stiffness with increasing age. While equine TMJ disc properties are generally similar to other herbivores, greater compressive stiffness throughout the disc and greater GAG content in its rostral region suggest that mechanical demands on the TMJ disc differ between horses and other species. Importantly, a region-specific decrease in compressive stiffness was observed associated with joint disease and corresponded to cartilage erosions in the underlying condylar surface.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The goal of this study was to investigate the incorporation/penetration of compliant polyacrylamide microparticles (MPs), into either cancer or normal human cell spheroids. Incorporation of collagen-1-coated MPs (stiffness: 0.1 and 9 kPa; diameter: 15-30 µm) into spheroids (diameter ∼100 µm) was tracked for up to 22 h. Results indicated that cells within melanoma spheroids were more influenced by MP mechanical properties than cells within normal cell spheroids. Melanoma spheroids had a greater propensity to incorporate and displace the more compliant MPs over time. Mature spheroids composed of either cell type were able to recognize and integrate MPs. While many tumor models exist to study drug delivery and efficacy, the study of uptake and incorporation of cell-sized MPs into established spheroids/tissues or tumors has been limited.

This study aimed to: (1) assess the feasibility of an innovative, knee-challenging, one-leg double-hop test consisting of a forward hop followed by a diagonal hop (45°) performed medially (UMDH) or laterally (ULDH) in an unanticipated manner; and (2) determine within- and between-session reliability for 3-dimensional hip and knee kinematics and kinetics of these tests. Twenty-two healthy women (22.3 ± 3.3 years) performed three successful UMDH and ULDH, twice 1-4 weeks apart. Hop success rate was 69-84%. Peak hip and knee angles demonstrated moderate to excellent within-session reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.99, standard error of measurement [SEM] ≤  3°) and poor to excellent between-session reliability (ICC CI: 0.22-0.94, SEM ≤ 3°) for UMDH and ULDH. The smallest real difference (SRD) was low (≤ 5°) for nearly all peak angles. Peak hip and knee moments demonstrated poor to excellent reliability (ICC CI: 0-0.97) and, in general, moments were more reliable within-session (SEM ≤ 0.14 N.m/kg.m, both directions) than between-session (SRD ≤ 0.43 N.m/kg.m). Our novel test was feasible and, in most but not all cases, provided reliable angle estimates (within-session > between-session, both directions) albeit less reliable moments (within-session > between-session, both directions).

Degradation of collagen fibres is hypothesized to be a strain dependent process whereby the rate of degradation is affected by the magnitude of strain applied to the collagen fibres. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of small angle light scattering (SALS) imaging to identify strain dependent degradation of collagen fibres in arterial tissue ex vivo, and determine whether a strain induced protection mechanism exists in arterial tissue as observed in pure collagen and other collagenous tissues. SALS was used in combination with histological and second harmonic generation (SHG) analysis to determine the collagen fibre architecture in arterial tissue subjected to strain directed degradation. SALS alignment analysis identified statistically significant differences in fibre alignment depending on the strain magnitude applied to the tissue. These results were also observed using histology and SHG. Our findings suggest a strain protection mechanism may exist for arterial collagen at intermediate strain magnitudes between 0% and 25%.

Ten healthy young adults and ten healthy older adults were tested for maximal isokinetic torque and on a set of ADL tasks. Using inverse dynamics, the shoulder torques during ADLs were referenced to the maximal isokinetic torque and relative effort was determined. Older compared to younger adults had >40% lower isokinetic shoulder abduction strength. The ratio of peak joint torque during six ADLs over the maximal isokinetic torque, i.e., relative effort, was higher in old (∼52%) compared with young adults (∼22%, p < 0.05). Relative effort in older adults was over 40% in overhead activities and particularly high in abduction and reaching tasks, over 60%.

Similarly, there is also evidence that the lumbo-pelvic rhythm is key for evaluation of realistic muscle and joint reaction forces and moments predicted by various computational musculoskeletal models. This study investigated the effects of three lumbo-pelvic rhythms defined based on in-vivo measurements on the spinal response during moderate forward flexion (60°) using a combined approach of musculoskeletal modeling of the upper body and finite element model of the lumbosacral spine. The muscle forces and joint loads predicted by the musculoskeletal model, together with the gravitational forces, were applied to the finite element model to compute the disc force and moment, intradiscal pressure, annular fibers strain, and load-sharing. The results revealed that a rhythm with high pelvic rotation and low lumbar flexion involves more global muscles and increases the role of the disc in resisting spinal loads, while its counterpart, with low pelvic rotation, recruits more local muscles and engages the ligaments to lower the disc loads. On the other hand, a normal rhythm that has balanced pelvic and lumbar rotations yields almost equal disc and ligament load-sharing and results in more balanced synergy between global and local muscles. The lumbo-pelvic rhythm has less effect on the intradiscal pressure and annular fibers strain. This work demonstrated that the spinal response during forward flexion is highly dependent on the lumbo-pelvic rhythm. It is therefore, essential to adapt this parameter instead of using the default values in musculoskeletal models for accurate prediction of muscle forces and joint reaction forces and moments. The findings provided by this work are expected to improve knowledge of spinal response during forward flexion, and are clinically relevant towards low back pain treatment and disc injury prevention.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim was to investigate the alterations of treatment-naïve pelvis and thigh muscle lengths and volumes in children with GMFCS levels I and II, of varying ages. 17 children with CP (GMFCS I: N = 9, II: N = 8, age: 11.7 ± 4 years), age-matched to 17 typically developing (TD) children, underwent MRI of the LL. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the muscles were performed bilaterally. Muscle volumes and lengths were calculated in 3D and compared between groups. Linear regression between muscle volumes and age were computed. Adductor-brevis and gracilis lengths, as well as rectus-femoris volume, were decreased in GMFCS I compared to TD (p < 0.05). Almost all the reconstructed muscle volumes and lengths were found to be altered in GMFCS II compared to TD and GMFCS I. All muscle volumes showed significant increase with age in TD and GMFCS I (R2 range: 0.3-0.9, p < 0.05). Rectus-femoris, hamstrings and adductor-longus showed reduced increase in the muscle volume with age in GMFCS II when compared to TD and GMFCS I. Alterations of treatment-naïve pelvis and thigh muscle volumes and lengths, as well as muscle growth, seem to increase with the severity of motor impairment in ambulant children with CP.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of running speed and rocker shoes on muscular activity, ground reaction force, and soft tissue vibrations. Twenty participants performed heel-toe running with two shoes, differentiated only by their sole shape (i.e. rocker and non-rocker), at four running speeds. Ground reaction force and electromyograms of the gastrocnemius medialis and vastus lateralis were measured, and soft tissue accelerations of the same muscles were recorded with tri-axial accelerometers. A continuous wavelet transform was applied to the accelerometer's signals to analyse them in the time-frequency domain. The rocker of the shoes did not change the muscular activations, ground reaction force, nor power of soft tissue vibrations. In opposite, increased running speed led to an augmentation of all of the measured parameters. Interestingly, running speed augmentation led to a greater increase in high frequencies component of soft tissue vibrations (25-50 Hz, 242%) than lower ones (8-25 Hz, 111%). Consequently, we indicated a 10% increase in the relative part of the high frequencies of the total power. In conclusion, although rocker shoes have shown an effect on lower-limb kinetics in some studies, no influence on soft tissue vibration is denoted. By contrast, soft tissue vibrations may be modulated by changing running speed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Computational simulations of the ABI can potentially determine the parameters that produce an ABI indicative of ischemia or other abnormalities in blood flow. However, 0- and 1-D computational methods are limited in describing a 3-D patient-derived geometry. Thus, we present a massively parallel framework for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in the full arterial system. Using the lattice Boltzmann method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, we employ highly parallelized and scalable methods to generate the simulation domain and efficiently distribute the computational load among processors. For the first time, we compute an ABI with 3-D CFD. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigate the dependence of ABI on the presence of stenoses, or narrowed regions of the arteries, by directly modifying the arterial geometry. As a result, our framework enables the computation a hemodynamic factor characterizing flow at the scale of the full arterial system, in a manner that is extensible to patient-specific imaging data and holds potential for treatment planning.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Additionally, patellar tendon (PT) grafts incur a greater risk of osteoarthritis compared to hamstring grafts (HT). Aberrant gait biomechanics, including greater loading rates (i.e. impulsive loading), are linked to the development of knee osteoarthritis. However, the role of graft selection on walking gait biomechanics linked to osteoarthritis is poorly understood, thus the purpose of this study was to compare walking gait biomechanics between individuals with HT and PT grafts. Ninety-eight (74 PT; 24 HT) subjects with a history of ACLR performed walking gait at a self-selected speed from which the peak vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) during the first 50% of the stance phase and its instantaneous loading rate, peak internal knee extension and valgus moments, and peak knee flexion and varus angles were obtained. When controlling for time since ACLR and quadriceps strength, there were no differences in any kinetic or kinematic variables between graft types. While not significant, 44% of the PT cohort were identified as impulsive loaders (displaying a heelstrike transient in the majority of walking trials) compared to only 25% of the HT cohort (odds ratio = 2.3). This more frequent observation of impulsive loading may contribute to the greater risk of osteoarthritis with PT grafts. Future research is necessary to determine if impulsive loading and small magnitude differences between graft types contribute to osteoarthritis risk when extrapolated over thousands of steps per day.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Computed tomography (CT) has become the gold standard for reconstructing 3D bone models, as it provides high geometric accuracy and similar tissue contrast to video-radiography. Alternatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not expose subjects to radiation and provides the ability to add cartilage and other soft tissues to the models. However, the accuracy of MRI-based 2D-3D registration for quantifying glenohumeral kinematics is unknown. We developed an automatic 2D-3D registration program that works with both CT- and MRI-based image volumes for quantifying joint motions. The purpose of this study was to use the proposed 2D-3D auto-registration algorithm to describe the humerus and scapula tracking accuracy of CT- and MRI-based registration relative to radiostereometric analysis (RSA) during dynamic biplanar video-radiography. The GH kinematic accuracy (RMS error) was 0.6-1.0 mm and 0.6-2.2° for the CT-based registration and 1.4-2.2 mm and 1.2-2.6° for MRI-based registration. Higher kinematic accuracy of CT-based registration was expected as MRI provides lower spatial resolution and bone contrast as compared to CT and suffers from spatial distortions.

However, predicting how well very large therapeutic molecules diffuse through cartilage is often difficult, and the relationship between local transport mechanics for these molecules and tissue heterogeneities in the tissue is still unclear. In this study, a 150 kDa antibody diffused through the articular surface of healthy and enzymatically degraded cartilage, which enabled the calculation of local diffusion mechanics in tissue with large compositional variations. Local cartilage composition and structure was quantified with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging techniques. Overall, both local concentrations of aggrecan and collagen were correlated to local diffusivities for both healthy and surface-degraded samples (0.3 > R2 < 0.9).

Unfortunately, assessment of knee joint laxity is limited by current methodologies resulting in suboptimal diagnostics and treatment. This paper presents a novel method for accurately measuring non-invasive knee joint laxity in four degrees-of-freedom (DOF). An arthrometer, combining a parallel manipulator and a six-axis force/moment sensor, was developed to be used in combination with a low-dose biplanar x-ray system and 3D image data to reconstruct tibiofemoral position and orientation of laxity measurements. As proof-of-concept, four cadaveric knees were tested in the device. Each cadaveric knee was mounted in the device at approximately 30° of flexion and twelve monoplanar anteroposterior, mediolateral and internal/external load cases were applied. Additionally, four biplanar load cases were applied, consisting of different combinations of anteroposterior and internal/external loads. The arthrometer was limited to four DOF to address the specific measurements. For validation purposes, the pose reconstructions of tibia and femur were compared with pose reconstructions of bone pin marker frames mounted on each bone. The measurements from the arthrometer in terms of translation and rotations displayed comparable values to what have previously been presented in the literature. Furthermore, the measurements revealed coupled motions in multiple planes, demonstrating the importance of multi DOF laxity measurements. The validation displayed an average mean difference for translations of 0.08 mm and an average limit of agreement between -1.64 mm and 1.80 mm. The average mean difference for rotations was 0.10° and the limit of agreement was between -0.85° and 1.05°.

Aortic stenosis presents with heavily calcified leaflets and it has been proposed that this calcification also acts to secure the valve, but this has never been quantified. In this study, we developed an in vitro calcified aortic root model to quantify the role of calcification on the tissue-stent interaction. The in vitro model incorporated artificial calcifications affixed to the leaflets of porcine aortic heart valves. A self-expanding nitinol braided stent was deployed into non-calcified and artificially calcified porcine aortic roots and imaged by micro computed tomography. Mechanical tests were then conducted to dislodge the stent from the aortic root and it was found that, in the presence of calcification, there was a significant increase in pullout force (8.59 ± 3.68 N vs. 2.84 ± 1.55 N p = 0.045), stent eccentricity (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 0.02 ± 0.01, p = 0.049), and coefficient of friction between the stent and aortic root (0.36 ± 0.12 vs. 0.09 ± 0.05, p = 0.018), when compared to non-calcified roots.

Low-porosity endovascular stents, known as flow diverters (FDs), have been proposed as an effective and minimally invasive treatment for sidewall intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Although it has been reported that the efficacy of a FD is substantially influenced by its porosity, clinical doctors would clearly prefer to do their interventions optimally based on refined quantitative data. This study focuses on the association between the porosity configurations and the FD efficacy, in order to provide practical data to help the clinical doctors optimize the interventions.


METHOD
Numerical simulations in fluid dynamics were performed using four patient-specific IA geometries, pulsatile velocity profiles and braided fully resolved FDs. The variation of velocity and wall shear stress within the IAs, were investigated in this study. Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was used to solve the main challenge centered on the diversity of spatial scales since the typical diameter of struts of FDs is only 25μm while the artery normally can be larger by a hundred times.


RESULTS
Numerical simulations revealed that the blood flow within IA sac was substantially reduced when the porosity is less than 86%. In particular, the flow condition within each IA sac is favorite to initialize thrombus formation when porosity is less than 70%.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests the existence of a porosity threshold below which the efficacy of a FD will be sufficient for the patients to initialize the thrombus formation. Therefore, by estimating the porosity of FD on patient-specific information, it may be potentially to predict whether or the blood flow condition will successfully become prothrombotic after the FD intervention.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The cross-modal plasticity of the somatosensory system with common sensory pathways including pain, pressure and vibration offers a novel opportunity to enhance quadriceps function during walking. This study explores the effectiveness of an active knee brace that used intermittent cutaneous vibration during walking to enhance the peak knee flexion moment (KFM) during early stance phase as a surrogate for net quadriceps moment (balance between knee extensor and flexor muscle moments). The stimulus was turned on prior to heel strike and turned off at mid-stance of the gait cycle. Twenty-one subjects with knee pathologies known to inhibit quadriceps function were tested walking under three conditions: control (no brace), a passive brace, and an active brace. Findings show that compared to the control, subjects wearing an active brace during gait exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) increase in peak KFM and no significant difference when wearing a passive brace (p = 0.17). Furthermore, subjects with low KFM and knee flexion angle (KFA) in control exhibited the greatest increase in KFA at loading response in the active brace condition (R = 0.47, p < 0.05). Intermittent cutaneous stimulation during gait, therefore, provides an efficient method for increasing the KFM in patients with knee pathologies. This study's results suggest that intermittent vibration stimulus can activate the cross-modalities of the somatosensory system in a manner that gates pain stimulus and possibly restores quadriceps function in patients with knee pain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A sample of 57 children aged 3-5 years participated in the study. Structural stabilometric descriptors of sample entropy (SEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and sway density curve (SDC) analysis were employed to assess features of center of pressure sway. A force platform was used to collect center of pressure data during standing balance over 40 s in four conditions: standing on rigid and foam surfaces with eyes open and closed. The main results are as follows: (1) sample entropy decreased and DFA_coefficient increased with age, while the SDC variables remained unaltered among the 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children; (2) as sensory conditions became more challenging, sample entropy decreased and DFA_coefficient increased, while MT and MD decreased and MD increased; age did not influence the responses to sensorial deprivation. In conclusion, 5-year-old children showed decreased variability of CoP sway during standing balance compared with the younger children, but all children used the same corrective torques to control for perturbations. More challenging sensory deprivation conditions resulted in decreased variability of postural sway, higher amplitudes and more frequent correcting torques for stabilization, but age did not influence these behaviors.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the fundamental question of how different blebs interact with each other during their life cycles remains largely unclear. Here, we report a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to examine how the growth and retraction of a cellular bleb are influenced by neighboring blebs as well as the fusion dynamics between them. Specifically, a boundary integral model was developed to describe the shape evolution of cell membrane during the blebbing/retracting process. We showed that a drop in the intracellular pressure will be induced by the formation of a bleb whose retraction then restores the pressure level. Consequently, the volume that a second bleb can reach was predicted to heavily depend on its initial weakened size and the time lag with respect to the first bleb, all in quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. In addition, it was found that as the strength of membrane-cortex adhesion increases, the possible coalescence of two neighboring blebs changes from smooth fusion to abrupt coalescence and eventually to no fusion at all. Phase diagrams summarizing the dependence of such transition on key physical factors, such as the intracellular pressure and bleb separation, were also obtained.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In vivo, we have observed rapid reepithelialization and deposition of normal dermis in Acomys after wounding. Acomys skin also has a lower modulus and lower elastic energy storage than normal lab mice, Mus musculus. To see if the different in vivo mechanical microenvironments retained an effect on dermal cells and contributed to regenerative behavior, we examined isolated keratinocytes in response to physical wounding and fibroblasts in response to varying substrate stiffness. Classic mechanobiology paradigms suggest stiffer substrates will promote myofibroblast activation, but we do not see this in Acomys dermal fibroblasts (DFs). Though Mus DFs increase organization of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive stress fibers as substrate stiffness increases, Acomys DFs assemble very few αSMA-positive stress fibers upon changes in substrate stiffness. Acomys DFs generate lower traction forces than Mus DFs on pliable surfaces, and Acomys DFs produce and modify matrix proteins differently than Mus in 2D and 3D culture systems. In contrast to Acomys DFs ""relaxed"" behavior, we found that freshly isolated Acomys keratinocytes retain the ability to close wounds faster than Mus in an in vitro scratch assay. Taken together, these preliminary observations suggest that Acomys dermal cells retain unique biophysical properties in vitro that may reflect their altered in vivo mechanical microenvironment and may promote scar-free wound healing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to create a normative database of hip and knee biomechanics during walking, running, and single leg landings based on five commonly utilized HJC methods to serve as a reference for inter-study comparisons. Secondarily, we devised to provide comparisons of peak knee angles and hip angles, moments, and powers from the five HJC methods. Thirty healthy young adults performed walking, running, and single leg landing tasks at self-selected speeds (walking/running) and at 90% of their maximum jump height (landing). Three-dimensional motion capture and ground reaction forces were collected during all tasks. Five different HJC prediction methods: Bell, Davis, Hara, Harrington, and Greater Trochanter were implemented separately in a 6 degree of freedom model. Predicted HJC locations, direct kinematics, and inverse dynamics were computed for all tasks. Predicted HJC mediolateral, anteroposterior, and superior-inferior locations differed between methods by an average of 1.3, 2.9, and 1.4 cm, respectively. A database was created using the mean of all subjects for all five methods. In addition, one-way ANOVAs were used to compare triplanar peak angles, moments, and powers between the methods.

CFD analyses assumed rigid walls, a non-Newtonian behavior for the blood and MRI measured patient-specific blood flow profiles as inlet boundary conditions.

War fighters exposed to an IED attack were highly susceptible to lower limb injuries. To appropriately assess vehicle safety and make informed improvements to vehicle design, a novel Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD), called the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin (WIAMan), was designed for vertical loading. The main objective of this study was to develop and validate a Finite Element (FE) model of the WIAMan lower limb (WIAMan-LL). Appropriate materials and contacts were applied to realistically model the physical dummy. Validation of the model was conducted based on experiments performed on two different test rigs designed to simulate the vertical loading experienced during an under-vehicle explosion. Additionally, a preliminary evaluation of the WIAMan and Hybrid-III test devices was performed by comparing force responses to post-mortem human surrogate (PMHS) corridors. The knee axial force recorded by the WIAMan-LL when struck on the plantar surface of the foot (2 m/s) fell mostly within the PMHS corridor, but the corresponding data predicted by the Hybrid-III was almost 60% higher. Overall, good agreements were observed between the WIAMan-LL FE predictions and experiments at various pre-impact speeds ranging from 2 m/s up to 5.8 m/s. Results of the FE model were backed by mean objective rating scores of 0.67-0.76 which support its accuracy relative to the physical lower limb dummy. The observations and objective rating scores show the model is validated within the experimental loading conditions. These results indicate the model can be used in numerical studies related to possible dummy design improvements once additional PMHS data is available.

Arrays of surface electrodes were used to collect EMGs from gastrocnemius and soleus muscles while twelve, young male participants stood at ease for 60 s. Muscles in each leg were deemed active whenever the Root Mean Square amplitude of EMGs (40 ms epochs) detected by any channel in the arrays exceeded the noise level, defined from EMGs detected during rest. The Chi-Square statistics revealed significant differences in the relative number of active periods for both muscles in 10 out of 12 participants tested, ranging from 2% to 65% (χ2 > 17.90; P < 0.01). Pearson correlation analysis indicated side differences in the duration of gastrocnemius though not soleus activity were associated with the centre of pressure mean, lateral position (R = 0.60; P = 0.035). These results suggest therefore that surface EMGs may provide different estimates of the timing of plantar flexors' activity if collected unilaterally during standing and that asymmetric activation may be not necessarily associated with weight distribution between limbs. Depending on the body side from which EMGs are collected, the active contribution of plantar flexors to standing stabilization may be either under- or over-valued.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We propose functional diagnostic parameters, pressure drop coefficient (CDP), energy loss (Eloss), and normalized energy loss (E¯loss) to characterize pulmonary hemodynamics, and evaluate their efficacy in delineating stenosis severity using in vitro experiments. Subject-specific test sections including the main PA (MPA) bifurcating into left and right PAs (LPA, RPA) with a discrete LPA stenosis were manufactured from cross-sectional imaging and 3D printing. Three clinically-relevant stenosis severities, 90% area stenosis (AS), 80% AS, and 70% AS, were evaluated at different cardiac outputs (COs). A benchtop flow loop simulating pulmonary hemodynamics was used to measure Q and Δp within the test sections. The experimental Δp-Q characteristics along with clinical data were used to obtain pathophysiologic conditions and compute the diagnostic parameters. The pathophysiologic QLPA decreased as the stenosis severity increased at a fixed CO. CDPLPA, Eloss,LPA (absolute), and E¯loss,LPA (absolute) increased with an increase in LPA stenosis severity at a fixed CO. Importantly, CDPLPA and E¯loss,LPA had reduced variability with CO, and distinct values for each LPA stenosis severity. Under variable CO, a) CDPLPA values were 14.5-21.0 (70% AS), 60.7- 2.2 (80% AS), ≥ 261.6 (90% AS), and b) E¯loss,LPA values (in mJ per QLPA) were -501.9 to -1023.8 (70% AS), -1247.6 to -1773.0 (80% AS), -1934.5 (90% AS).

Tendon storage for later testing becomes necessary when performing large experiments with multiple time-points. However, it is unclear whether freezing rodent tendons affects their material properties. Thus the aim of this study was to determine whether freezing rat Achilles tendons affects their biomechanical or structural properties. Tendons were frozen at either -20 °C or -80 °C directly after harvesting, or tested when freshly harvested. Groups of tendons were subjected to several freeze-thaw cycles (1, 2, and 5) within 3 months, or frozen for 9 months, after which the tendons were subjected to biomechanical testing. Additionally, fresh and thawed tendons were compared morphologically, histologically and by transmission electron microscopy. No major differences in biomechanical properties were found between fresh tendons and those frozen once or twice at -20 °C or -80 °C. However, deterioration of tendon properties was found for 5-cycle groups and both long-term freezing groups; after 9 months of freezing at -80 °C the tear resistance of the tendon was reduced from 125.4 ± 16.4N to 74.3 ± 18.4N (p = 0.0132). Moreover, tendons stored under these conditions showed major disruption of collagen fibrils when examined by transmission electron microscopy. When examined histologically, fresh samples exhibited the best cellularity and proteoglycan content of the enthesis. These properties were preserved better after freezing at -80 °C than after freezing at -20 °C, which resulted in markedly smaller chondrocytes and less proteoglycan content. Overall, the best preservation of histological integrity was seen with tendons frozen once at -80 °C. In conclusion, rat Achilles tendons can be frozen once or twice for short periods of time (up to 3 months) at -20 °C or -80 °C for later testing. However, freezing for 9 months at either -20 °C or -80 °C leads to deterioration of certain parameters.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Imaging modalities have been developed that can measure ventricular deformation non-invasively. However, because of the small thickness, complex shape, and anatomic position of the right ventricle, using these technologies to determine its deformation remains challenging. Here we develop a first fiduciary marker-based method to assess heterogeneity and anisotropy of right ventricular epicardial strain across the entire free wall. To this end, we combine a high-density array of sonomicrometry crystals implanted across the entire right ventricular epicardial surface with a subdivision surface algorithm and a large deformation kinematics framework. We demonstrate our approach on four beating ovine hearts and present a preliminary regional analysis of circumferential, longitudinal, and areal strain. Moreover, we illustrate maps of the same strains across the entire right ventricular epicardial surface to highlight their spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy. We observe in these animals that RV epicardial strains vary throughout the cardiac cycle, are heterogeneous across the RV free wall, and are anisotropic with larger compressive strains, i.e., contraction, in the longitudinal direction than in the circumferential direction. Average peak compressive strains vary by region between -3.34% and -8.29% in circumferential direction, and -4.02% and -10.57% in longitudinal direction. In summary, we introduce an experimental framework that will allow us to study disease- and device-induced deformations, and long-term consequences of these deformations, including heterogeneous and anisotropic effects.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The incidence of back disorders is greater in women than men, and for similar work demands females are functioning closer to their physiological limit. It is crucial to study loading on the spine musculoskeletal system with actual handlers, including females, to better understand the risk of back disorders. Extrapolation from biomechanical studies conducted on unexperienced subjects (mainly males) might not be applicable to actual female workers. For male workers, expertise changes the lumbar spine flexion, passive spine resistance, and active/passive muscle forces. However, experienced females select similar postures to those of novices when spine loading is critical. This study proposes that the techniques adopted by male experts, male novices, and females (with considerable experience but not categorized as experts) impact their lumbar spine musculoskeletal systems differently. Spinal loads, muscle forces, and passive resistance (muscle and ligamentous spine) were predicted by a multi-joint EMG-assisted optimization musculoskeletal model of the lumbar spine. Expert males flexed their lumbar spine less (avg. 21.9° vs 30.3-31.7°) and showed decreased passive internal moments (muscle avg. 8.9% vs 15.9-16.0%; spine avg. 4.7% vs 7.1-7.8%) and increased active internal moments (avg. 72.9% vs 62.0-63.9%), thus producing a different impact on their lumbar spine musculoskeletal systems. Experienced females sustained the highest relative spine loads (compression avg. 7.3 N/BW vs 6.2-6.4 N/BW; shear avg. 2.3 N/BW vs 1.7-1.8 N/BW) in addition to passive muscle and ligamentous spine resistance similar to novices. Combined with smaller body size, less strength, and the sequential lifting technique used by females, this could potentially mean greater risk of back injury. Workers should be trained early to limit excessive and repetitive stretching of their lumbar spine passive tissues.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Patient-specific 3D model from CT or MR improves the understanding of the patient's anatomy and information about the hemodynamics aid in patient risk assessment and treatment planning. This work presents a new approach for personalized stent design in pulmonary artery interventions combining personalized patient geometry and hemodynamic simulations. First, the stent position is initialized using a geometric approach. Second, the stent and artery expansion, including the foreshortening behavior of the stent is simulated. Two stent designs are considered, a regular stent and a Y-stent for bifurcations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the blood flow in the initial and expanded artery models are performed using patient-specific boundary conditions in form of a pulsatile inflow waveform, 3-element Windkessel outflow conditions, and deformable vessel walls. The simulations have been applied to 16 patient cases with a large variability of anatomies. Finally, the simulations have been clinically validated using retrospective imaging from angiography and pressure measurements. The simulated pressure, volume flow and flow velocity values were on the same order of magnitude as the reference values obtained from clinical measurements, and the simulated stent placement showed a positive impact on the hemodynamic values. Simulation of geometric changes combined with CFD simulations offers the possibility to optimize stent type, size, and position by evaluating different configurations before the intervention, and eventually allow to test customized stent geometries and new deployment techniques in CHD.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This explanation of PFP assumes that VM and VL produce opposing mediolateral forces on the patella. Although studies have provided evidence for opposing actions of VM and VL on the patella, other studies have suggested that their actions might be similar. In this study, we took advantage of the experimental accessibility of the rat to directly measure the forces on the patella produced by VM and VL. We found that VM and VL produce opposing mediolateral forces on the patella when the patella was lifted away from the femur. These distinct mediolateral forces were not transmitted to the tibia, however: forces measured at the distal tibia were very similar for VM and VL. Further, when the patella was placed within the trochlear groove, the forces on the patella produced by VM and VL were very similar to one another. These results suggest that mediolateral forces produced by VM and VL are balanced by reaction forces from the trochlear groove and so are not transmitted to the tibia. These results provide a rich characterization of the mechanical actions of VM and VL and have implications about the potential role of these muscles in PFP and their neural control during behavior.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

One method to characterize spine movement behavior is to measure the local dynamic stability (LDS) of spine movement during a repetitive flexion task in which a participant is asked to touch multiple targets repetitively. Within the literature, it has been well established that an individual's focus of attention (FOA) can modulate their neuromuscular control and affect task performance. The goal of this project was to examine the unknown effect of FOA on LDS measurements and timing error during a repetitive spine flexion task that is commonly used to assess movement control. Fourteen healthy adults (7 male) were instructed to touch two targets (shoulder height and knee height) to the beat of a metronome (4 s/cycle) for 35 consecutive cycles. They completed this task under internal (focus on trunk movement) and external (focus on targets) FOA conditions. Motion capture data of the trunk and sacrum were collected at 120 Hz. The lumbar spine angle was defined as the orientation of the trunk relative to the pelvis. The local divergence exponent (λmax) was calculated from the sum of squares of the 3-dimensional spine angle. Timing error was calculated as the time difference between target touches and metronome beats. Changing an individual's FOA had no effect on λmax calculations or timing error. Although clear task instructions are important, it is not essential to control for FOA during this movement assessment protocol.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, sports injuries occur dynamically and unpredictably, yet the relationship between explosive torque and balance response to dynamic perturbations is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between explosive torque of the plantar flexors and knee extensors and the centre of mass (COM) response to unexpected perturbations. Thirty-three healthy subjects (17 females, 16 males) were assessed for maximal and explosive isometric knee extension (KE) and plantar flexion (PF) torque and COM response (velocity (COMV), displacement (COMD)) to unexpected platform translations. Relationships between explosive torque and balance measures were investigated using Pearson's correlation and multiple regression.

However, it is unknown if their morphology is a result of genetics or training during growth. To explore the influence of training during growth, thirty guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) were split into exercise and sedentary groups. Exercise birds were housed in a large pen and underwent high-acceleration training during their growth period (age 4-14 weeks), while sedentary birds were housed in small pens to restrict movement. Morphological analyses (muscle mass, PCSA, optimal fascicle length, pennation angle) of a hip extensor muscle (ILPO) and plantarflexor muscle (LG), which differ in architecture and function during running, were performed post-mortem. Muscle mass for both ILPO and LG was not different between the two groups. Exercise birds were found to have ∼12% and ∼14% longer optimal fascicle lengths in ILPO and LG, respectively, than the sedentary group despite having ∼3% shorter limbs. From this study we can conclude that optimal fascicle lengths can increase as a result of high-acceleration training during growth. This increase in optimal fascicle length appears to occur irrespective of muscle architecture and in the absence of a change in muscle mass. Our findings suggest high-acceleration training during growth results in muscles that prioritize adaptations for lower strain and shortening velocity over isometric strength. Thus, the adaptations observed suggest these muscles produce higher force during dynamic contractions, which is beneficial for movements requiring large power outputs.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fifteen participants stood hip-width apart with their eyes open, closed and while performing two different cognitive tasks. Participants were continuously perturbed by medial-lateral (ML) support surface translations corresponding to, and hence doubling, their own center of mass sway. We analyzed the standard deviation (SD), root mean square (RMS), range, and mean power frequency (MPF) of center of pressure displacements. ML postural sway increased due to the perturbation (SD p ≤ .001, range p < .001, RMS p ≤ .001, MPF p < .001). Cognitive load increased the ML sway range (p = .048).

However, in (Polacheck et al., 2011) Kamm and collaborators found that there is a competing downstream and upstream migration transport mechanism. Their study showed that both mechanisms are present at the same time and the relative strength of these two stimuli governs the directional bias in migration for a cell population and is a function of cell density, interstitial flow rate, and CCR7 receptor availability. The main objective of this work is to give a possible explanation of these two different concurrent cell migration mechanisms by means of a theoretical model. Relying on multiphase modelling, separate momentum balance equations are formulated, respectively, for the cell phase and the interstitial fluid (IF) phase. In order to represent proteolytic activity and autologous chemotaxis a non-moving ECM component is included, as well as proteases secreted by the cancer cells and chemokine that can be released from ECM. The cell and IF momentum balance equations include cell-ECM and fluid-ECM resistance force terms (i.e., classical Darcy's equation terms), but also a cell-fluid interaction term that can account for a more indirect effect that fluid-generated stress may have on cancer cells. We illustrate how the cancer cells can work through this term and effectively avoid being pushed in the flow direction, and even create upstream migration by controlling its magnitude and sign. We think of this as the mathematical interpretation of the experimental observation by Kamm and collaborators that the fluid generated matrix adhesion tension on the upstream side of cells activates integrin adhesion complexes, resulting in activation of focal adhesion (FA) proteins. The model predicts that generally the strength of the upstream migration mechanism is sensitive to the cell volume fraction: a lower density of cells is subject to a weaker upstream migration effect; a higher density of cancer cells can more effectively generate upstream migration. This behavior is a result of the nonlinear coupling between cell-ECM, fluid-ECM, and cell-fluid interaction terms that naturally are involved in the mathematical expression for the net cell velocity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unsuccessful recanalization attempts in stroke patients have been associated with fibrin-rich thromboemboli linking retrieval mechanism performance and clot composition. To continue development of stroke retrieval mechanisms, the material properties of cerebral thromboemboli must be replicated; however, current methods for emboli analog formation lack quantitative measurements for both material stiffness and composition of cerebral thromboemboli. This study investigates emboli analog (EA) formation to mimic the material stiffness and composition of cerebral thromboemboli to develop new retrieval mechanisms.


METHODS
To induce static and dynamic environments for clot replication, a 9:1 ratio of porcine whole blood and 2.45% calcium chloride remained stationary or rotated at 34, 50 and 80 RPM. Histology and a custom MATLAB code provided composition analysis results. Likewise, quantitative results from biomechanical testing were obtained for direct comparison of the material stiffness of cerebral thromboemboli.


RESULTS
Fibrin/platelet content as well as material stiffness increased due to increasing rotational speed. Approximately 11% of the biomechanical testing results exhibited nonlinearity after an initial yield point, of which 60% were from statically formed EAs. Those formed at 50 RPM were most similar in material stiffness to thromboemboli extracted from carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures (p = 0.97).


CONCLUSIONS
The dynamically formed EAs may be altered to obtain a range of fibrin/platelet to erythrocyte ratios. The proposed methodology for EA formation offers a platform for continued development of retrieval mechanism prototypes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To this end, laboratories have utilized computed tomography (CT) to create 3-dimensional (3D) models of bone, which are then registered to high-speed biplanar radiographic data captured during movement in order to measure in vivo joint kinematics. In the present study, we describe a system for measuring dynamic joint mechanics using 3D surface models of the joint created from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) registered to high-speed biplanar radiographs using a novel automatic registration algorithm. The use of MRI allows for modeling of both bony and soft tissue structures. Specifically, the attachment site footprints of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on the femur and tibia can be modeled, allowing for measurement of dynamic ACL deformation.

Nineteen trained endurance runners performed an incremental running protocol, with a 3-min recording period at 10, 12, 14 and 16 km/h. Spatiotemporal parameters (contact and flight times, step length and step frequency) were measured using the OptoGait system and step variability was considered for each parameter, in terms of within-participants standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV%). Step variability was considered over six different durations at every velocity tested: 0-10 s, 0-20 s, 0-30 s, 0-60 s, 0-120 s and 0-180 s. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences in the magnitude of the four spatiotemporal parameters between the recording intervals at each running velocity tested (p ≥ 0.05, ICC > 0.90). The post-hoc analysis confirmed no significant differences in step variability (SD and CV% of each spatiotemporal parameter at any velocity tested) between measurements. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement method showed that longer recording intervals yield smaller systematic bias, random errors, and narrower limits of agreement, regardless of running velocity.

ICA diameters, derived from 3D segmentation of rotational angiograms, were used to estimate inflow rates via power laws from the aneurysm CFD literature assuming the same inlet wall shear stress (WSS) (n = 3), velocity (n = 2) or flow rate (n = 0) for all cases. To illustrate the potential impact of errors in flow rate estimates, pulsatile CFD was carried out for four cases having large errors for at least one power law. Flow rates estimated by n = 3 and n = 0 power laws had significant (p < 0.01) mean biases of -22% to +32%, respectively, but with individual errors ranging from -78% to +120%. The n = 2 power law had no significant bias, but had non-negligible individual errors of -58% to +71%. CFD showed similarly large errors for time-averaged sac WSS; however, these were reduced after normalizing by parent artery WSS. High frequency WSS fluctuations, evident in 2/4 aneurysms, were also sensitive to inflow rate errors. Care should therefore be exercised in the interpretation of aneurysm CFD studies that rely on power law estimates of inflow rates, especially if absolute (vs. normalized) WSS, or WSS instabilities, are of interest.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the context of multi-scale modeling the response of tropocollagen molecules to stretch should be very carefully predicted in order to describe the mechanical behavior of soft tissues. To this end, the worm-like chain (WLC) model is often applied, although it is restricted to the entropic force regime which is essential at moderate deformations. To describe molecular forces under larger stretches several extensions of the WLC have been proposed for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This contribution aims to investigate the applicability of these models in the context of tropocollagen and discusses the feasibility of their application. Finally, the models are validated in comparison to experimental data available in the literature.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Several models of muscle force distribution based on non-invasive measurements have been proposed since 1836 (Weber and Weber, 1836), amongst which Crowninshield's model (Crowninshield and Brand, 1981), which maximizes a cost-function representing the muscle fiber endurance, is the most popular. It is worth noting that Crowninshield's model is the most widely adopted notwithstanding its major limitations of physiological coherence. Forster et al. (2004) pointed out that ""these (conventional) criteria however do not predict co-contraction adequately"". Besides, electromyographic (EMG)-driven models have been proposed to assess individual muscle forces, which have not been broadly adopted due to their complexity and the need for a calibration before each test. In this context, a cost function based on kinematic and electromyographic data could provide the advantage of being physiologically more coherent with muscle activations compared to conventional cost-functions based on kinematics solely, and easier to use than the EMG-driven models. The objective of this study is to propose the first cost-function based on kinematics and electromyographic data to quantify muscle forces. When applying this new cost-function on a database of upper limb motions data of 17 subjects, healthy or with cerebral palsy, the muscle force prediction of the proposed model was 17.74% more coherent with the EMG pattern than the prediction of Crowninshield's model. And on average, these results were more consistent whether the subjects were healthy or with cerebral palsy. In conclusion, we propose this cost-function for the quantification of muscle forces.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The heel-pads of five volunteers were compressed using a custom-made ultrasound indentation device. Tissue deformation was assessed from B-mode ultrasound and force was measured using a load cell to calculate the force - deformation graph of the indentation test. These results were used to design subject specific FE models and to inverse engineer the tissue's hyperelastic material coefficients and its stress - strain behavior. SW speed was measured for different levels of compression (from 0% to 50% compression). SW speed for 0% compression was used to assess the initial stiffness of heel-pad (i.e. initial shear modulus, initial Young's modulus). Changes in SW speed with increasing compressive loading were used to quantify the tissue's nonlinear mechanical behavior based on the theory of acoustoelasticity. Statistical analysis of results showed significant correlation between SW-based and FE-based estimations of initial stiffness, but SW underestimated initial shear modulus by 64%(±16). A linear relationship was found between the SW-based and FE-based estimations of nonlinear behavior. The results of this study indicate that SW elastography is capable of reliably assessing differences in stiffness, but the absolute values of stiffness should be used with caution. Measuring changes in SW speed for different magnitudes of compression enables the quantification of the tissue's nonlinear behavior which can significantly enhance the diagnostic value of SW elastography.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Measurement and calculation of contact forces in THR patients has been limited by small sample sizes, wide variation in patient and surgical factors, and short-term follow-up. This study hypothesised that, at long-term follow-up, unilateral THR patients have similar calculated hip contact forces compared to controls walking at similar (self-selected) speeds and, in contrast, THR patients walking at slower (self-selected) speeds have reduced hip contact forces. It was further hypothesised that there is no difference in calculated hip contact forces between operated and non-operated limbs at long-term follow-up for both faster and slower patients. Gait analysis data for THR patients walking at faster (walking speed: 1.29 ± 0.12 m/s; n = 11) and slower (walking speed: 0.72 ± 0.09 m/s; n = 11) speeds were used. Healthy subjects constituted the control group (walking speed: 1.36 ± 0.12 m/s; n = 10). Hip contact forces were calculated using static optimisation. There was no significant difference (p > 0.31) in hip contact forces between faster and control groups. Conversely, force was reduced at heel strike by 19% (p = 0.002), toe-off by 31% (p < 0.001) and increased at mid-stance by 15% (p = 0.02) for the slower group compared to controls. There were no differences between operated and non-operated limbs for the slower group or the faster group, suggesting good biomechanical recovery at long-term follow-up.

Fascicle-sliding, for example, is used by energy-storing tendons to enable them to undergo large extensions while protecting the fascicles from damage. Reductions in fascicle-sliding capacity may thus predispose certain populations to tendinopathy. Evidence from the Achilles tendon of significant superficial-to-deep non-uniformity that is reduced with age supports this theory. Similar patellar tendon non-uniformity has been observed, but the effects of age and sex have yet to be assessed. Healthy adults (n = 50, 25M/25F) from a broad range of ages (23-80) were recruited and non-uniformity was quantified using ultrasound speckle-tracking during passive knee extension. Significant superficial-to-deep non-uniformity and proximal/distal variations were observed. No effect of age was found, but males exhibited significantly greater non-uniformity than females (p < 0.05). The results contrast with previous findings in the Achilles tendon; in this study, tendons and tendon regions at high risk for tendinopathy (i.e. males and proximal regions, respectively) exhibited greater non-uniformity, whereas high-risk Achilles tendons (i.e. older adults) previously showed reduced non-uniformity. This suggests that non-uniformity may be dominated by factors other than fascicle-sliding. Anatomically, the varied proximal attachment of the patellar tendon may influence non-uniformity, with quadriceps passive resistance limiting superficial tendon movement, thus linking flexibility, non-uniformity and injury risk. This study also provides evidence of a differential effect of aging on the patellar tendon compared with evidence from prior studies on other tendons necessitating further study to elucidate links between non-uniformity and injury.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Because exercise may alter muscle and tendon MMP activity and matrix turnover, we hypothesized that doxycycline would abolish the beneficial adaptations found with exercise but have no effect on cage activity muscle and tendon properties. Rats were divided into acute or chronic exercise (EX) or cage activity (CA) groups, and half of the rats received doxycycline orally. Animals in acute EX groups were euthanized 24 h after a single bout of exercise (10 m/min, 1 h) on a flat treadmill. Animals in chronic EX groups walked on a flat treadmill and were euthanized at 2 or 8 week time points. Assays included supraspinatus tendon mechanics and histology and muscle fiber morphologic and type analysis. Doxycycline improved tendon mechanical properties and collagen organization in chronic cage activity groups, which was not consistently evident in exercised groups. Combined with exercise, doxycycline decreased average muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Results of this study suggest that administration of doxycycline at pharmaceutical doses induces beneficial supraspinatus tendon adaptations without negatively affecting the muscle in cage activity animals, supporting the use of doxycycline to combat degenerative processes associated with underuse; however, when combined with exercise, doxycycline does not consistently produce the same beneficial adaptations in rat supraspinatus tendons and reduces muscle fiber cross-sectional area, suggesting that doxycycline is not advantageous when combined with activity.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous measures of lateral tibial slope, however, vary from study to study and often lack documentation of their accuracy. These factors impede identifying the magnitude of lateral tibial slope that increases risk of noncontact ACL rupture. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a new method that (1) requires minimal user input; (2) employs 3D renderings of the tibia that are referenced to a 3D anatomic coordinate system; and (3) is precise, reliable, and accurate. The user first isolated the proximal tibia from computed tomography (CT) scans. Then, the algorithm placed the proximal tibia in an automatically generated tibial coordinate system. Next, it identified points along the rim of subchondral bone around the lateral tibial plateau, iteratively fit a plane to this rim of points, and, finally, referenced the plane to the tibial coordinate system. Precision and reliability of the lateral slope measurements were respectively assessed via standard deviation and intra- and inter-class correlation coefficients using CT scans of three cadaveric tibia. Accuracy was quantified by comparing changes in lateral tibial slope calculated by our algorithm to predefined in silico changes in slope. Precision, reliability, and accuracy were ≤0.18°, ≥0.998, and ≤0.13°, respectively.

For knee bones, automatic algorithms constructing ACSs exist and are assumed to be more reliable than manual methods, although both approaches are based on non-unique numerical reconstructions of true bone geometries. Furthermore, determining the best algorithms is difficult, as algorithms are evaluated on different datasets. Thus, in this study, we developed 3 algorithms, each with 3 variants, and compared them with 5 from the literature on a dataset comprising 24 lower-limb CT-scans. To evaluate algorithms' sensitivity to the operator-dependent reconstruction procedure, the tibia, patella and femur of each CT-scan were each reconstructed once by three different operators. Our algorithms use principal inertia axis (PIA), cross-sectional area, surface normal orientations and curvature data to identify the bone region underneath articular surfaces (ASs). Then geometric primitives are fitted to ASs, and the ACSs are constructed from the geometric primitive points and/or axes.

Nineteen healthy participants aged 24-74 years underwent spine curvature, pelvic tilt and trunk ROM measurements on two separate occasions. Rigid four-marker clusters were attached to the skin overlying seven spinous processes, plus single markers on pelvis landmarks. Rigid body rotations of spine marker clusters were calculated to determine neutral posture and ROM in flexion, extension, total lateral bending (left-right) and total axial rotation (left-right). Segmental spine ROM values were in line with previous reports using opto-electronic motion capture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were calculated as measures of between-session reliability and measurement error, respectively. Retroreflective markers showed fair to excellent between-session reliability to measure thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and pelvic tilt (ICC = 0.82, 0.63, and 0.54, respectively). Thoracic and lumbar segments showed highest reliabilities in total axial rotation (ICC = 0.78) and flexion-extension (ICC = 0.77-0.79) ROM, respectively.

However, different neural solutions can result in different HJCF estimations. NMS model predictions are also influenced by the selection of neuromuscular parameters, which are either based on cadaveric data or calibrated to the individual. To date, the best combination of neural solution and parameter calibration to obtain plausible estimations of HJCF have not been identified. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of three electromyography (EMG)-informed neural solution modes (EMG-driven, EMG-hybrid, and EMG-assisted) and static optimisation, each using three different parameter calibrations (uncalibrated, minimise joint moments error, and minimise joint moments error and peak HJCF), on the estimation of HJCF in a healthy population (n = 23) during walking. When compared to existing in-vivo data, the EMG-assisted mode and static optimisation produced the most physiologically plausible HJCF when using a NMS model calibrated to minimise joint moments error and peak HJCF. EMG-assisted mode produced first and second peaks of 3.55 times body weight (BW) and 3.97 BW during walking; static optimisation produced 3.75 BW and 4.19 BW, respectively. However, compared to static optimisation, EMG-assisted mode generated muscle excitations closer to recorded EMG signals (average across hip muscles R2 = 0.60 ± 0.37 versus R2 = 0.12 ± 0.14).

Estimates of power are usually limited by the capabilities of measurement systems, resulting in the use of simplified power models. This review provides a systematic overview of the studies on mechanical power in sports, discussing the application and estimation of mechanical power, the consequences of simplifications, and the terminology. The mechanical power balance consists of five parts, where joint power is equal to the sum of kinetic power, gravitational power, environmental power, and frictional power. Structuring literature based on these power components shows that simplifications in models are done on four levels, single vs multibody models, instantaneous power (IN) versus change in energy (EN), the dimensions of a model (1D, 2D, 3D), and neglecting parts of the mechanical power balance. Quantifying the consequences of simplification of power models has only been done for running, and shows differences ranging from 10% up to 250% compared to joint power models. Furthermore, inconsistency and imprecision were found in the determination of joint power, resulting from inverse dynamics methods, incorporation of translational joint powers, partitioning in negative and positive work, and power flow between segments. Most inconsistency in terminology was found in the definition and application of 'external' and 'internal' work and power.

Inter-digit joint angles were recorded to map hand and finger motions and estimate joint moments for each condition. Participants exerted twice the force when pushing with whole hand vs. fingertips. 72-75% of the total force was exerted over the base of the palm, while only 11-13% with the thumb for exertions at 90°, 45° or 0° plate angles.

Amongst them, osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OPN) hold special significance due to their intimate interaction with the mineral and collagenous matrix in bone. Both proteins have been associated with microdamage and fracture, but their structural role in energy dissipation is unclear. This study used bone tissue from genetic deficient mice lacking OC and/or OPN and subjected them to a series of creep-fatigue-creep tests. To this end, whole tibiae were loaded in four-point bending to 70% stiffness loss which captured the three characteristic phases of fatigue associated with initiation, propagation, and coalescence of microdamage. Fatigue loading preceded and followed creep tests to determine creep and dampening parameters. Microdamage in the form of linear microcracks and diffuse damage were analyzed by histology. It was shown that OC and OPN were 'activated' following stiffness loss associated with fatigue damage where they facilitated creep and dampening parameters (i.e. increased energy dissipation). More specifically, post-fatigue creep rate and dampening were significantly greater in wild-types (WTs) than genetic deficient mice (p < 0.05). These results were supported by microdamage analysis which showed significant increase in creep-associated diffuse damage formation in WTs compared to genetic deficient groups (p < 0.05).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
4 groups; control group (CG; n = 25; age = 31.8 ± 7.5 years; BMI = 21.4 ± 2.5 kg/m2), obese group (OG; n = 25; age = 34.4 ± 9.5 years; BMI = 39.6 ± 5.4 kg/m2), elderly group (EG; n = 15; age = 77.1 ± 8.4 years; BMI = 24.4 ± 1.3 kg/m2) and obese elderly group (ObEG; n = 12; age = 78.6 ± 6.6 years; BMI = 34.5 ± 3.1 kg/m2) performed maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) before testing to calculate the maximal relative force of ankle plantar flexor (PF) and dorsal flexor (DF) muscles. Center of pressure (CoP) parameters and the electromyography (EMG) activity of PF and DF muscles were collected during MVC, quiet standing and limit of stability (LoS) testing along antero-posterior and medio-lateral axes.


RESULTS
Maximal relative force was higher in EG and ObEG than CG and OG, respectively (p < 0.001). CoP parameters, distance traveled along the antero-posterior axis and EMG activity of PF were higher in OG, EG and ObEG compared to CG (p < 0.001) and in EG compared to ObEG (p < 0.05).The EMG activity of PF was positively correlated with CoP parameters in OG and ObEG (r > 0.6; p < 0.05). Maximal relative force of PF (r > -0.6; p < 0.05) was negatively correlated with CoP parameters in ObEG and EG.


CONCLUSION
Obesity-related postural control alteration is associated with increased activity of PF.

These injuries are caused by biological cascades leading from a given mechanical loading state in tissues to irreversible tissue damage. Estimating the internal mechanical conditions within loaded soft tissues has the potential of improving the management and prevention of PU. Several Finite Element models of the buttock have therefore been proposed based on either MRI or CT-Scan data. However, because of the limited availability of MRI or CT-Scan systems and of the long segmentation time, all studies in the literature include the data of only one individual. Yet the inter-individual variability can't be overlooked when dealing with patient specific estimation of internal tissue loading. As an alternative, this contribution focuses on the combined use of low-dose biplanar X-ray images, B-mode ultrasound images and optical scanner acquisitions in a non-weight-bearing sitting posture for the fast generation of patient-specific FE models of the buttock. Model calibration was performed based on Ischial Tuberosity sagging. Model evaluation was performed by comparing the simulated contact pressure with experimental observations on a population of 6 healthy subjects. Analysis of the models confirmed the high inter-individual variability of soft tissue response (maximum Green Lagrange shear strains of 213 ± 101% in the muscle). This methodology opens the way for investigating inter-individual factors influencing the soft tissue response during sitting and for providing tools to assess PU risk.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We investigated the potential effects of femur and pelvis geometry on applied loads during lateral falls on the hip. Fifteen female volunteers underwent DXA imaging to characterize two pelvis and six femur geometric features. Additionally, participants completed low-energy sideways falls on the hip; peak impact force and pressure, contact area, and moment of force applied to the proximal femur were extracted. No geometric feature was significantly associated with peak impact force. Peak moment of force was significantly associated with femur moment arm (p = 0.005). Peak pressure was positively correlated with pelvis width and femur moment arm (p < 0.05), while contact area was negatively correlated with metrics of pelvis width and femur neck length (p < 0.05). This is the first study to link experimental measures of impact loads during sideways falls with image-based skeletal geometry from human volunteers. The results suggest that while skeletal geometry has limited effects on overall peak impact force during sideways falls, it does influence how impact loads are distributed at the skin surface, in addition to the bending moment applied to the proximal femur.

We implemented common boundary conditions and tissue properties on a large cohort (N = 1371), and showed the relationships were highly linear (R2 > 0.99) for yield strength and reaction force between FE models. Cadaver radii measured on both generation HR-pQCT with matched ROIs were used to back-calculate a tissue modulus that accounts for the increased resolution (61 µm versus 82 µm), resulting in a modulus of 8748 MPa for second-generation HR-pQCT to produce bone yield strength and reaction force equivalent to using 6829 MPa for first-generation HR-pQCT. Finally, in vivo scans (N = 61) conducted on both generations demonstrated that the larger ROI in the second-generation system results in stronger bone outcome measures, suggesting it is not advisable to convert FE results across HR-pQCT generations without matching ROIs. Together, these findings harmonize FE results by providing a means to compare findings with different boundary conditions and tissue properties, and across scanner generations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is important to understand how slight alterations in lower extremity kinematics during a squat affect the internal joint loading of the knee. This study directly quantified tibiofemoral contact throughout the in vitro simulation of a bodyweight back squat performed two ways: a heel squat (knees in line with toes) and a toe squat (knees anterior to the toes) at peak knee flexion. Three cadaveric right lower extremities were instrumented and positioned into the University of Texas Joint Load Simulator. Kinematics, kinetics, and predicted muscle forces from a 20-year-old athletic male performing the two back squats were used as inputs for the in vitro simulations. The quantified tibiofemoral contact area, peak pressure, net force, and center of pressure location were significantly different between squat types (p > 0.05). Net contact area on the tibial plateau at peak knee flexion was significantly larger in the heel versus toe squat (599 ± 80 mm2 vs. 469 ± 125 mm2; p < 0.05). Peak lateral pressure was significantly higher in the heel versus toe squat (2.73 ± 0.54 MPa vs. 0.87 ± 0.56 MPa; p < 0.05). Results suggest the heel squat generates an even load distribution, which is less likely to affect joint degeneration. Future in vitro simulations should quantify the effects lower extremity kinematics, kinetics, and individual muscle forces have on tibiofemoral contact parameters during common athletic tasks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is therefore critical to identify the mechanisms driving them and biomechanical analyses hold great clinical promise, since rupture/dissection occur when aortic wall strength is unable to withstand hemodynamic stresses. Although several studies have been done on the biomechanical properties of thoracic aortic aneurysms, few data are available about thoracic aortic dissections. Detailed mechanical tests with measurement of tissue thickness and failure properties were performed with a tensile-testing device on 445 standardized specimens, corresponding to 19 measurement sites per inner (intima with most of media)/outer layer (leftover media with adventitia); harvested from twelve patients undergoing emergent surgical repair for type A dissection. Our data suggested inherent differences in tissue properties between the origin of dissection and distal locations, i.e. thinner and stiffer inner layers that might render them more vulnerable to tearing despite their increased strength. The strength of tissue circumferentially was greater than that longitudinally, likely determining the direction of tear. The relative strengths of the inner: ∼{65,40}N/cm2 and outer layer: ∼{350,270}N/cm2 in the two principal directions of dissected tissue were differentiated from the intima: ∼{100,75}N/cm2, media: ∼{150,55}N/cm2, and adventitia: ∼{270,190}N/cm2 of non-dissected ascending aortic aneurysms (Sokolis et al., 2012), in favor of weaker inner and stronger outer layers, allowing an explanation as to why the presently-studied tissue suffered dissection, i.e. tear of the inner layers, and not rupture, i.e. full tearing across the entire wall thickness.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Facemasks may increase the peak acceleration and severity index; therefore, as-used helmets may not mitigate head impacts as effectively as certification tests indicate. Furthermore, the effect is expected to depend on the helmet design as well as the orientation and speed of the impact. This study examined the influence of the facemask on impact behavior in a NOCSAE-style linear drop test and the interactions with location, velocity, and helmet model.

Walking ground reaction forces are among the key parameters necessary for gait analysis. However, these parameters are commonly measured using force plates or instrumented treadmills which are expensive and bulky and can only be used in a controlled laboratory environment. Despite the importance of real-life gait measurement, developing reliable and practical techniques and technologies necessary for continuous real-life monitoring of gait is still an open challenge, mainly due to the lack of a practical and cost-effective wearable technology for ground reaction force measurement. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the total walking ground reaction force GRFvt in the vertical direction using data from a single inertial measurement unit. Correlation analysis of the vertical acceleration of different body segments with GRFvt indicated that the 7th cervical vertebrae is one of the best locations for the sensor. The proposed method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art GRFvt estimation by 25%, by utilising the time-varying ratio of the vertical acceleration of the human body centre of mass and measured C7 vertical acceleration. Results of this study showed that the proposed method estimated consistently the GRFvt in both indoor and urban outdoor environment, with a 4-8% peak-to-peak normalised root mean square error.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic idiopathic low back pain on kinetic variables of gait in different foot masks. 11 idiopathic chronic low back pain patients and 13 healthy matched controls participated in this study. Using Emed foot-scanner system, the ground reaction force and impulse were measured during barefoot normal walking. Then, the average footprints were divided into 10 masks using the Automask program and the data were extracted using Multimask Evaluation programs. The low back pain disability was measured by Quebec questionnaire. Our results revealed that the ground reaction force and impulse in medial and lateral midfoot and hallux masks of patients were significantly lower than controls. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated greater ground reaction force and impulse in 3-5th metatarsals mask than control group. There was a significant interaction between the low back pain and the foot masks factors. In conclusion, the ground reaction forces and impulses in different areas of foot are affected by low back pain. Therefore, the kinetic gait analysis should be considered as an appropriate tool in evaluation and prescribing proper treatment program in low back pain patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, we tested two assumptions that have been made in experimental studies on muscle mechanics: (i) that the torque-angle properties are similar among agonistic muscles crossing a joint, and (ii) that the sum of the torque capacity of individual muscles adds up to the torque capacity of the agonist group.


METHODS
Maximum isometric torque measurements were made using a specifically designed animal knee extension dynamometer for the intact rabbit quadriceps muscles (n = 10) for knee angles between 60 and 120°. The nerve branches of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles were carefully dissected, and a custom made nerve cuff electrode was implanted on each branch. Knee extensor torques were measured for four maximal activation conditions at each knee angle: VL activation, VM activation, RF activation, and activation of all three muscles together.


RESULTS
With the exception of VL, the torque-angle relationships of the individual muscles did not have the shape of the torque-angle relationship obtained when all muscles were activated simultaneously. Furthermore, the maximum torque capacity obtained by adding the individual torque capacities of VL, VM and RF was approximately 20% higher than the torques produced when the three muscles were activated simultaneously.


DISCUSSION
These results bring into question our understanding of in-vivo muscle contraction and challenge assumptions that are sometimes made in human and animal muscle force analyses.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of the neck surrogate on head kinematics. Inertial loads were generated using a pendulum system with an anthropomorphic head attached to a Hybrid III (HIII) or EuroSID-2 (ES-2) neck. The ATD head-neck assemblies were tested under extension, flexion, lateral bending, oblique extension, and oblique flexion at 3.4 m/s. Peak head kinematics were found to be statistically different with the ES-2 versus HIII neck under certain cases. For extension, the resultant peak linear acceleration (PLA) and resultant peak angular acceleration (PAA) were statistically higher with the ES-2 versus HIII neck. For flexion and lateral bending, there were no statistical differences in the resultant PLA based on neck selection although the resultant PAA was statistically higher with the ES-2 versus HIII neck. For oblique extension, the resultant PLA and PAA statistically increased with the ES-2 versus HIII neck. Furthermore, the acceleration components ax, αx, and αy were statistically higher with the ES-2 neck while ay showed no statistical difference due to neck selection. For oblique flexion, the resultant PLA and PAA were statistically higher with the ES-2 versus HIII neck. Additionally, the acceleration components ax, ay, αx, and αy were statistically higher with the ES-2 versus HIII neck. These findings indicate that for certain loading directions and acceleration components, head kinematics were influenced by the neck surrogate used.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nonetheless, the parameters of PM models adopted for simulations up until now were rarely calibrated to match the represented FD structure. We therefore sought to evaluate the PM parameters for a representative variety of commercially available stents, so characterising the flow-diversion behaviours of different FD devices on the market. We generated fully-resolved geometries for treatments using PED, Silk+, FRED, and dual PED stents. We then correspondingly derived the calibrated PM parameters-permeability (k) and inertial resistance factor (C2)-for each stent design from CFD simulations, to ensure the calibrated PM model has identical flow resistance to the FD stent it represents. With each of the calibrated PM models respectively deployed in two aneurysms, we studied the flow-diversion effects of these stent configurations. This work for the first time reported several sets of parameters for PM models, which is vital to address the current knowledge gap and rectify the errors in PM model simulations, thereby setting right the modelling protocol for future studies using PM models. The flow resistance parameters were strongly affected by porosity and effective thickness of the commercial stents, and thus accounted for in the PM models. Flow simulations using the PM stent models revealed differences in aneurysmal mass flowrate (MFR) and energy loss (EL) between various stent designs. This study improves the practicability of FD simulation by using calibrated PM models, providing an individualised method with improved simulation efficiency and accuracy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Spatial and temporal parameters were studied to understand the trunk recovery from an anteriorly directed perturbation. Eighteen male and female subjects (18-27 yrs) participated in active and passive trunk flexion-extension, performed seven days apart. Subjects performed 60 trunk flexion-extension repetitions in each condition. Subjects either volitionally moved their trunks (active condition) or relaxed while a dynamometer controlled the movements (passive condition). Trunk perturbations occurred before and immediately after two 30 repetition sessions. Initial responses included latency measures of trunk displacement and peak trunk velocity (VP). Temporal measures included perturbation onset to initial trunk movement (TD), movement initiation to VP (TMIPV), and perturbation onset to VP (TPPV). Recovery measures included peak recovery velocity (VPR), recovery time (TR), velocity slope (VS), and recovery slope (RS). Differences between loading sessions were present for TPPV (p < .05), TR (p < .05), and RS (p < .05). Overall, the results indicate repetitive loading leads to lower resistance to perturbation, but faster recovery from perturbation although no differences to active or passive repetitive loading was observed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In physiological conditions, food is a factor having a significant effect on the values of the loads acting on the stomatognathic system. Considering that the act of mastication is a complex process, this research undertook to determine the forces (bite forces, muscular forces and temporomandibular joint reaction forces) acting on the stomatognathic system during the dynamic symmetric incisal biting of selected foodstuffs. The investigations were divided into two stages: (1) experimental tests and (2) numerical simulations. In the first stage, classic force-displacement characteristic curves (Fi-Δh) were determined for the food while in the second stage, the curves were used as a dynamic stomatognathic system model load function. One of the most important results of this research is that the food characteristic in the form of a force-displacement function has been shown to have a significant effect not only on the values of the muscular forces and the temporomandibular joint reaction forces, but also on their curves during the dynamic loading of the stomatognathic system. The analysis of the results indicates that Fi-Δh has an effect on not only the (active and passive) forces, but also on other parameters, such as stress, deformation, displacement, and probably the rigidity of the muscles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The specimens were scanned using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to obtain measures of bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC), and DTS to obtain measures of bone texture. Using a custom loading apparatus designed to deliver a nonuniform displacement resulting in a wedge deformity similar to those observed clinically, the specimens were loaded to fracture and their fracture strength was recorded. Mixed model regressions were used to determine the associations between wedge strength and DTS derived textural variables, alone and in the presence of BMD or BMC information. DTS derived fractal, lacunarity and mean intercept length variables correlated with wedge strength, and individually explained up to 53% variability. DTS derived textural variables, notably fractal dimension and lacunarity, contributed to multiple regression models of wedge strength independently from BMC and BMD. The model from a scan orientation transverse to the spine axis and in the anterior-posterior view resulted in highest explanatory capability (R2adj = 0.91), with a scan orientation parallel to the spine axis and in the lateral view offering an alternative (R2adj = 0.88).

Despite the high prevalence of rotator cuff pathology in these individuals, the pathogenesis of rotator cuff disease remains unclear. Position and motion related mechanisms of rotator cuff disease are often proposed, but poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of systematically altering glenohumeral plane on subacromial proximities across arm elevation as measures of tendon compression risk. Three-dimensional models of the humerus, scapula, coracoacromial ligament, and supraspinatus were reconstructed from MRIs in 20 subjects. Glenohumeral elevation was imposed on the humeral and supraspinatus tendon models for three glenohumeral planes, which were chosen to represent flexion, scapular plane abduction, and abduction based on average values from a previous study of asymptomatic individuals. Subacromial proximity was quantified as the minimum distance between the supraspinatus tendon and coracoacromial arch (acromion and coracoacromial ligament), the surface area of the supraspinatus tendon within 2 mm proximity to the coracoacromial arch, and the volume of intersection between the supraspinatus tendon and coracoacromial arch. The lowest modeled subacromial supraspinatus compression measures occurred during flexion at lower angles of elevation. This finding was consistent across all three measures of subacromial proximity. Knowledge of this range of reduced risk may be useful to inform future studies related to patient education and ergonomic design to prevent the development of shoulder pain and dysfunction.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this work, we investigate the micropipette aspiration method to measure the mechanical properties of soft tissues and cells with surface effects. The neo-Hookean constitutive model is adopted to describe the hyperelasticity of the measured biological material, and the surface effect is taken into account by the finite element method. It is found that when the pipette radius or aspiration length is comparable to the elastocapillary length, surface energy may distinctly alter the aspiration response. Generally, both the aspiration length and the bulk normal stress decrease with increasing surface energy, and thus neglecting the surface energy would lead to an overestimation of elastic modulus. Through dimensional analysis and numerical simulations, we provide an explicit relation between the imposed pressure and the aspiration length. This method can be applied to determine the mechanical properties of soft biological tissues and organs, e.g., livers, tumors and embryos.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

This motion may reposition the cervical vertebrae in a way that is dissimilar to the upright resting posture that is often used as the initial position in cadaveric studies of catastrophic neck injury. Therefore our aim was to compare the ""neutral"" cervical alignment measured using fluoroscopy of 11 human subjects while resting in a neutral posture and as their neck passed through neutral during the four combinations of active flexion and extension movements in both an upright and inverted posture. Muscle activation patterns were also measured unilaterally using surface and indwelling electromyography in 8 muscles and then compared between the different conditions. Overall, the head posture, cervical spine alignment and muscle activation levels were significantly different while moving compared to resting upright. Compared to the resting upright condition, average head postures were 6-13° more extended, average vertebral angles varied from 11° more extended to 10° more flexed, and average muscle activation levels varied from unchanged to 10% MVC more active, although the exact differences varied with both direction of motion and orientation. These findings are important for ex vivo testing where the head and neck are statically positioned prior to impact - often in an upright neutral posture with negligible muscle forces - and suggest that current cadaveric head-first impact tests may not reflect many dynamic injury environments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective of this study is to examine the nanoindentation based elastic modulus (E) at different bone regions adjacent to titanium dental implants with guided bone regeneration (GBR) treated with DBM and BMP-2 during different post-implantation periods. Six adult male beagle dogs were used to create circumferential defects with buccal bone removal at each implantation site of mandibles. The implant systems were randomly assigned to only GBR (control), GBR with demineralized bone matrix (DBM), and GBR with DBM + recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) (BMP) groups. Three animals were sacrificed at each 4 and 8 weeks of post-implantation healing periods. Following buccolingual dissection, the E values were assessed at the defects (Defect), interfacial bone tissue adjacent to the implant (Interface), and pre-existing bone tissue away from the implant (Pre-existing). The E values of BMP group had significantly higher than control and DBM groups for interface and defect regions at 4 weeks of post-implantation period and for the defect region at 8 weeks (p < 0.043). DBM group had higher E values than control group only for the defect region at 4 weeks (p < 0.001).

This simplification assumes equivalent moment arms and muscle lengths for all fibers within a muscle even with complex geometry and may result in inaccurate estimations of muscle force and joint loading. The objectives of this study were to quantify the three-dimensional (3D) human TMJ muscle attachment morphometry and examine its impact on TMJ mechanics. 3D muscle attachment surfaces of temporalis, masseter, lateral pterygoid, and medial pterygoid muscles of human cadaveric heads were generated by co-registering measured attachment boundaries with underlying skull models created from cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images. A bounding box technique was used to quantify 3D muscle attachment size, shape, location, and orientation. Musculoskeletal models of the mandible were then developed and validated to assess the impact of 3D muscle attachment morphometry on joint loading during jaw maximal open-close. The 3D morphometry revealed that muscle lengths and moment arms of temporalis and masseter muscles varied substantially among muscle fibers. The values calculated from the centroid-to-centroid model were significantly different from those calculated using the 'Distributed model', which considered crucial 3D muscle attachment morphometry. Consequently, joint loading was underestimated by more than 50% in the centroid-to-centroid model. Therefore, it is necessary to consider 3D muscle attachment morphometry, especially for muscles with broad attachments, in TMJ musculoskeletal models to precisely quantify the joint mechanical environment critical for understanding TMJ function and mechanobiology.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite the prevalence of these injuries, the mechanism responsible for limited function has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to present preliminary findings that support a hypothesis that skeletal muscle remodeling is the driving factor of poor outcomes in some patients. Biomechanical and ultrasonography assessments were performed on a patient that presented with poor functional outcomes 2.5 years after a surgically-repaired acute Achilles tendon rupture. Single-leg heel raise height was decreased by 75% in the affected limb (3.0 cm compared to 11.9 cm) while walking mechanics showed no deficits. Ultrasonography revealed that the affected medial gastrocnemius muscle was less thick and had shorter, more pennate fascicles compared to the unaffected limb. A simple computational model of a maximal-effort plantarflexion contraction was employed to test the implications of changes in muscle architecture on single-leg heel raise function. Subject-specific measurements of fascicle length and pennation were input into the model, which supported these architectural parameters as being drivers of heel raise function. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that an Achilles tendon rupture elicits changes in skeletal muscle architecture, which reduces the amount of work and power the joint can generate. This multidisciplinary framework of biomechanical, imaging, and computational modeling provides a unique platform for studying the complex interactions between structure and function in patients recovering from Achilles tendon injuries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to determine relative contributions of individual lower-limb muscles to compressive articular loading of the medial and lateral TFJ during walking, running, and sidestepping. The medial and lateral compartments of the TFJ were loaded by a combination of medial and lateral muscles. During all gait tasks, the primary muscles loading the medial and lateral TFJ were the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) respectively during weight acceptance, while typically the medial gastrocnemii (MG) and lateral gastrocnemii (LG) dominated medial and lateral TFJ loading respectively during midstance and push off. Generally, the contribution of the quadriceps muscles were higher in running compared to walking, whereas gastrocnemii contributions were higher in walking compared to running. When comparing running and sidestepping, contributions to medial TFJ contact loading were generally higher during sidestepping while contributions to lateral TFJ contact loading were generally lower.

The application of shear stress on seeded cells can for example be achieved through bioreactors that perfuse medium through porous scaffolds. The generated mechanical environment (i.e. wall shear stress: WSS) within the scaffolds is complex due to the complexity of scaffold geometry. This complexity has so far prevented setting an optimal loading (i.e. flow rate) of the bioreactor to achieve an optimal distribution of WSS for stimulating cells to produce mineralised ECM. In this study, we demonstrate an approach combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and mechano-regulation theory to optimise flow rates of a perfusion bioreactor and various scaffold geometries (i.e. pore shape, porosity and pore diameter) in order to maximise shear stress induced mineralisation. The optimal flow rates, under which the highest fraction of scaffold surface area is subjected to a wall shear stress that induces mineralisation, are mainly dependent on the scaffold geometries. Nevertheless, the variation range of such optimal flow rates are within 0.5-5 mL/min (or in terms of fluid velocity: 0.166-1.66 mm/s), among different scaffolds. This approach can facilitate the determination of scaffold-dependent flow rates for bone tissue engineering experiments in vitro, avoiding performing a series of trial and error experiments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is found that the umbilical coiling index (UCI) is unable to distinguish between cords of significantly varying pressure and flow characteristics, which are typically determined by the vessel curvature, torsion and length. Larger scale geometric non-uniformities superposed over the inherent coiling, including cords exhibiting width and/or local UCI variations as well as loose true knots, typically produce a small effect on the total pressure drop. Crucially, this implies that a helical geometry of mean coiling may be used to determine the steady vessel pressure drop through a more complex cord. The presence of vessel constriction, however, drastically increases the steady pressure drop and alters the flow profile. For pulsatile-flow within the arteries, the steady pressure approximates the time-averaged value with high accuracy over a wide range of cords. Furthermore, the relative peak systolic pressure measured over the period is virtually constant and approximately 25% below the equivalent straight-pipe value for a large range of non-straight vessels. Interestingly, this suggests that the presence of vessel helicity dampens extreme pressures within the arterial cycle and may provide another possible evolutionary benefit to the coiled structure of the cord.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, these models include parameters that come from an array of sources, thus creating uncertainty in the model-estimated force. In this study, we used Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the sensitivity of Hill-based model muscle forces to changes in 11 parameters in the muscle-tendon unit morphological properties and in the model force-length and force-velocity relationships. We decomposed the force variability and ranked the sensitivity of the model to the underlying parameters using the Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces. For the analyzed running experiments and the adopted Hill model structure, our results show that the parameters are separable into four groups, where the parameters in each group have a synergistic contribution to the model global sensitivity. The first group consists of the maximum isometric force and the pennation angle. The second group contains the optimal fiber length, the tendon slack length, the tendon reference strain and the tendon shape factor. The third group contains the width and shape at the extremities of the active contractile element, along with the maximum contraction velocity and the curvature constant in the force-velocity curve. The fourth group consisted only of the force enhancement during eccentric contraction. The first two groups revealed the largest influence on the output force sensitivity. As many input parameters are difficult to measure and impact estimated forces, we propose that model estimates be presented with confidence intervals as well as inter-parameter relationships, to encourage users to explicitly consider the model uncertainty.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Stenting and percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) can relieve the obstruction and prolong the conduit lifespan, but require accurate pre-procedural evaluation to minimize the risk of coronary artery (CA) compression, stent fracture, conduit injury or arterial distortion. Herein, we test patient-specific finite element (FE) modeling as a tool to assess stenting feasibility and investigate clinically relevant risks associated to the percutaneous intervention. Three patients undergoing attempted PPVI due to calcific RVOT conduit failure were enrolled; the calcific RVOT, the aortic root and the proximal CA were segmented on CT scans for each patient. We numerically reproduced RVOT balloon angioplasty to test procedure feasibility and the subsequent RVOT pre-stenting expanding the stent through a balloon-in-balloon delivery system. Our FE framework predicted the occurrence of CA compression in the patient excluded from the real procedure. In the two patients undergoing RVOT stenting, numerical results were consistent with intraprocedural in-vivo fluoroscopic evidences. Furthermore, it quantified the stresses on the stent and on the relevant native structures, highlighting their marked dependence on the extent, shape and location of the calcific deposits. Stent deployment induced displacement and mechanical loading of the calcific deposits, also impacting on the adjacent anatomical structures. This novel workflow has the potential to tackle the analysis of complex RVOT clinical scenarios, pinpointing the procedure impact on the dysfunctional anatomy and elucidating potential periprocedural complications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Several classical forms of subcapital, transcervical, basicervical, and intertrochanteric fractures plus a specific type of subtrochanteric fracture were created and analyzed. A new procedure was developed for prediction of the strengths and the fracture initiation patterns using a FE-based linear scheme. The predicted and observed fracture patterns were in correspondence, and the FE predictions of the fracture loads were in very good agreement with the experimental results. Moreover, the crack initiation and growth behaviors of two subtrochanteric fractures were successfully simulated through a novel implementation of the cohesive zone model (CZM) within a nonlinear FE analysis scheme. The CZM parameters were obtained through a series of experimental tests on different types of specimens and determination of a variety of material properties for different anatomic regions and orientations. The presented results indicated that the locations and patterns of crack initiation, the sequences of crack growth on different paths, and the compatibility of growth increments agreed very well with the observed specifications.

Target-stepping paradigms are increasingly used to assess and train gait adaptability. Accurate gait-event detection (GED) is key to locating targets relative to the ongoing step cycle as well as measuring foot-placement error. In the current literature GED is either based on kinematics or centre of pressure (CoP), and both have been previously validated with young healthy individuals. However, CoP based GED has not been validated for stroke survivors who demonstrate altered CoP pattern.


METHODS
Young healthy adults and individuals affected by stroke stepped to targets on a treadmill, while gait events were measured using three detection methods; verticies of CoP cyclograms, and two kinematic criteria, (1) vertical velocity and position and of the heel marker, (2) anterior velocity and position of the heel and toe marker, were used. The percentage of unmatched gait events was used to determine the success of the GED method. The difference between CoP and kinematic GED methods were tested with two one sample (two-tailed) t-tests against a reference value of zero. Differences between group and paretic and non-paretic leg were tested with a repeated measures ANOVA.


RESULTS
The kinematic method based on vertical velocity only detected about 80% of foot contact events on the paretic side in stroke survivors while the method on anterior velocity was more successful in both young healthy adults as stroke survivors (3% young healthy and 7% stroke survivors unmatched). Both kinematic methods detected gait events significantly earlier than CoP GED (p < 0.001) except for foot contact in stroke survivors based on the vertical velocity.


CONCLUSIONS
CoP GED may be more appropriate for gait analyses of SS than kinematic methods; even when walking and varying steps.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Studying the biomechanical coordination strategies that differentiates loaded from unloaded vertical jumping may better inform training prescription for athletes needing to jump with load. Common multivariate methods (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) cannot quantify coordination in a dataset with more than two modes. This study aimed to identify coordinative factors across four modes of variation using Parallel Factor (Parafac2) analysis, which may differentiate unloaded (body weight [BW]) from loaded (BW + 20% BW) countermovement jump (CMJ). Thirty-one participants performed unloaded and loaded CMJ. Three-dimensional motion capture with force plate analysis was performed. Inverse dynamics was used to quantify sagittal plane joint angle, velocity, moment, and joint power across the ankle, knee, and hip. The four-mode data were as follows: Mode A was jump cycle (101 cycle points), mode B was participant (31 participants by two load), mode C was joint (two sides by three joints), and mode D was variable (angle, velocity, moment, power). Three factors were extracted, which explained 95.1% of the data's variance. Only factors one (P = 0.001) and three (P < 0.001) significantly differentiated loaded from unloaded jumping. The body augmented hip-dominant at the start, and both hip and ankle dominant behaviors at the end of the ascending phase of the CMJ, but kept knee-dominant behavior invariant, when jumping with a 20% BW load. By studying the variation across all data modes, Parafac2 provides a holistic method of studying jumping coordination.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fourteen competitive athletes ran on an instrumented treadmill for 10,000 m at speeds equivalent to 103% of their season's best time. Spatiotemporal and ground reaction force data were recorded at 1500, 3000, 5000, 7500 and 9500 m. Gait variability and inter-leg symmetry were measured using median absolute deviation (MAD) and the symmetry angle, respectively. There were no overall changes during the running bout for absolute values, symmetry angles or variability, and there were only moderate changes in variability between successive testing distances for three variables. Even with these few changes, variability was low (<4%) at all distances for all variables measured and, on average, the athletes were symmetrical for five of the seven gait variables measured. There were greater mean asymmetry values for flight time (1.1-1.4%) and for impact force (2.0-2.9%), which might have occurred because of muscle latency as the lower limb responded passively to impact during initial contact. Although most athletes were asymmetrical (>1.2%) for at least one variable, no one was asymmetrical for more than four of the seven variables measured. Being asymmetrical in a few variables is therefore not abnormal and not indicative of asymmetrical gait and given many practitioners analyze symmetry (and variability) on an individual, case-study basis, caution should be taken when assessing the need for corrective interventions.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We compared the ability of data reduced from time-normalised and landmark registered vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) waveforms captured during maximal countermovement jumps (CMJ) of 53 active male subjects to predict jump height. vGRF waveforms were landmark registered using different landmarks resulting in four registration conditions: (i) end of the eccentric phase, (ii) adding maximum centre of mass (CoM) power, (iii) adding minimum CoM power, (iv) adding minimum vGRF. In addition to the four registration conditions, the non-registered vGRF and concentric phase only were time-normalised and used in subsequent analysis. Analysis of characterising phases was performed to reduce the vGRF data to features that captured the behaviour of each waveform. These features were extracted from each condition's vGRF waveform, time-domain (time taken to complete the movement), and warping functions (generated from landmark registration). The identified features were used as predictor features to fit a step-wise multilinear regression to jump height. Features generated from the best performing registration condition were able to predict jump height to a similar extent as the concentric phase (86-87%), while all registration conditions could explain jump height to a greater extent than time-normalisation alone (65%). This suggests waveform variability was reduced as phases of the CMJ were aligned. However, findings suggest that over-registration can occur when applying landmark registration. Overall, landmark registration can improve prediction power to performance measures as waveform data can be reduced to more appropriate performance related features.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

There are several possible stimuli for bone remodelling processes, including bone fluid flow, streaming potential, and piezoelectricity. Poroelasticity has been widely used for elucidating the bone fluid flow phenomenon, but the combination of poroelasticity with charge density has not been introduced. Theoretically, general poroelasticity with a varying charge density is employed for determining the relationship between wave velocity and attenuation with charge density. Fast wave velocity and attenuation are affected by porosity as well as charge density; however, for a slow wave, both slow wave velocity and attenuation are not as sensitive to the effect of charge density as they are for a fast wave. Thus, employing human femoral data, we conclude that charged ions gather on trabecular struts, and the fast wave, which moves along the trabecular struts, is significantly affected by charge density.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, complications may occur due to biological responses to wear particles, as well as local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions triggered by metal ions and particles such as cobalt, chromium and molybdenum. The purpose of the study was to perform a highly demanding activities (HDA) knee wear simulation in order to compare the wear characteristics and metal ion release barrier function of a zirconium nitride (ZrN) coated knee implant, designed for patients with suspected metal ion hypersensitivity, against an uncoated knee implant made out of CoCrMo. The load profiles were applied for 5 million HDA cycles, which represent 15-30 years of in vivo service depending on the activity level of the patient. Results showed a significant wear rate reduction for the coated group (1.01 ± 0.29 mg/million cycles) in comparison with the uncoated group (2.89 ± 1.04 mg/million cycles). The zirconium nitride coating showed no sign of scratches nor delamination during the wear simulation, whereas the uncoated femurs showed characteristic wear scratches in the articulation areas. Furthermore, the metal ion release from the coated implants was reduced up to three orders of magnitude in comparison with the uncoated implants. These results demonstrate the efficiency of zirconium nitride coated knee implants to reduce wear as well as to substantially reduce metal ion release in the knee joint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fibroblast-seeded collagen gels were subjected to three distinct dynamic mechanical conditions for six days: Cyclic Equibiaxial Stretching at two constant strain magnitudes (CES-7% and CES-20%), and Cyclic Equibiaxial Stretching with incrementally Increasing stain magnitude (ICES, 7% → 15% → 20% each for two days). The frequency of cyclic stretching was set at 1 Hz. At the end of culture, mechanical properties of the gels were examined by biaxial mechanical testing and checked again upon the removal of seeded cells. Collagen microstructure within the gels was illustrated by multiphoton microscopy. The mRNA levels of collagen type I and type III and fibronectin in the cells were examined by reverse transcription PCR. The protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin was detected by immunohistochemistry. We found that the gels cultured under cyclic stretching were stiffer than those cultured under static stretching. Particularly, the stiffness appeared to be significantly enhanced when the ICES was employed. The enhancement of mechanical properties by cyclic stretching appeared to persist upon cell removal, suggesting an irreversible remodeling of extracellular matrix. Second harmonic generation images showed that collagen fibers became thicker and more compact in the gels cultured under cyclic stretching, which may explain the mechanical findings. The mRNA expression of collagen type I in the cells of the ICES was significantly greater than that of the other groups except for the CES-20%.

The objective of this study was to understand how the gait pattern used to load computational models of dysplastic hips influences computed joint mechanics. Three-dimensional pre- and post-operative hip models of thirty patients previously treated for hip dysplasia with periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) were developed for performing discrete element analysis (DEA). Using DEA, contact stress patterns were calculated for each pre- and post-operative hip model when loaded with an instrumented total hip, a dysplastic, a matched control, and a normal gait pattern. DEA models loaded with the dysplastic and matched control gait patterns had significantly higher (p = 0.012 and p < 0.001) average pre-operative maximum contact stress than models loaded with the normal gait. Models loaded with the dysplastic and matched control gait patterns had nearly significantly higher (p = 0.051) and significantly higher (p = 0.008) average pre-operative contact stress, respectively, than models loaded with the instrumented hip gait. Following PAO, the average maximum contact stress for DEA models loaded with the dysplastic and matched control patterns decreased, which was significantly different (p < 0.001) from observed increases in maximum contact stress calculated when utilizing the instrumented hip and normal gait patterns. The correlation between change in DEA-computed maximum contact stress and the change in radiographic measurements of lateral center-edge angle were greatest (R2 = 0.330) when utilizing the dysplastic gait pattern.

Older adults report mostly to fall while performing locomotor activities, especially the ones requiring stair negotiation. During these tasks, older adults, when compared with young adults, seem to redistribute their lower limb joint moments. This may indicate that older adults use a different strategy to accelerate the body upward during these tasks. The purposes of this study were to quantify the contributions of each lower limb joint moment to vertically accelerate the center of mass during stair ascent and descent, in a sample of community-dwelling older adults, and to verify if those contributions were correlated with age and functional fitness level. A joint moment induced acceleration analysis was performed in 29 older adults while ascending and descending stairs at their preferred speed. Agreeing with previous studies, during both tasks, the ankle plantarflexor and the knee extensor joint moments were the main contributors to support the body. Although having a smaller contribution to vertically accelerate the body, during stair descent, the hip joint moment contribution was related with the balance score. Further, older adults, when compared with the results reported previously for young adults, seem to use more their knee extensor moment than the ankle plantarflexor moment to support the body when the COM downward velocity is increasing. By contributing for a better understanding of stair negotiation in community dwelling older adults, this study may help to support the design of interventions aiming at fall prevention and/or mobility enhancement within this population.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here, we present a study that predicts the motion of the human body while lifting a box, as a function of flexibility of the hip and lumbar joints in the sagittal plane. We modeled the human body in the sagittal plane with joints actuated by pairs of agonist-antagonist muscle torque generators, and a passive hamstring muscle. The characteristics of a stiff, average and flexible person were represented by co-varying the lumbar range-of-motion, lumbar passive extensor-torque and the hamstring passive muscle-force. We used optimal control to solve for motions that simulated lifting a 10 kg box from a 0.3 m height. The solution minimized the total sum of the normalized squared active and passive muscle torques and the normalized passive hamstring muscle forces, over the duration of the motion. The predicted motion of the average lifter agreed well with experimental data in the literature. The change in model flexibility affected the predicted joint angles, with the stiffer models flexing more at the hip and knee, and less at the lumbar joint, to complete the lift. Stiffer models produced similar passive lumbar torque and higher hamstring muscle force components than the more flexible models. The variation between the motion characteristics of the models suggest that flexibility may play an important role in determining lifting technique.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, in patients with concomitant respiratory failure, the residual native circulation will provide deoxygenated blood to the upper body, and may cause differential hypoxemia of the heart and brain. In this paper, we present a general computational framework for the identification of differential hypoxemia risk in VA-ECMO patients. A range of different VA-ECMO patient scenarios for a patient-specific geometry and vascular resistance were simulated using transient computational fluid dynamics simulations, representing a clinically relevant range of values of stroke volume and ECMO flow. For this patient, regardless of ECMO flow rate, left ventricular stroke volumes greater than 28 mL resulted in all aortic arch branch vessels being perfused by poorly-oxygenated systemic blood sourced from the lungs. The brachiocephalic artery perfusion was almost entirely derived from blood from the left ventricle in all scenarios except for those with stroke volumes less than 5 mL. Our model therefore predicted a strong risk of differential hypoxemia in nearly all situations with some residual cardiac function for this combination of patient geometry and vascular resistance.

After an extensive search of the existing literature, this study summarizes 45 studies on in vivo thoracic kyphosis and kinematics and creates a systematic and detailed database. The thoracic kyphosis over T1-12 determined using non-radiological devices (34°) was relatively less than measured using radiological devices (40°) during standing. The majority of kinematical measurements are based on non-radiological devices. The thoracic range of motion (RoM) was greatest during axial rotation (40°), followed by lateral bending (26°), and flexion (21°) when determined using non-radiological devices during standing. The smallest RoM was identified during extension (13°). The lower thoracic level (T8-12) contributed more to the RoM than the upper (T1-4) and middle (T4-8) levels during flexion and lateral bending. During axial rotation and extension, the middle level (T4-8) contributed the most. Coupled motion was evident, mostly during lateral bending and axial rotation. With aging, the thoracic kyphosis increased by about 3° per decade, whereas the RoM decreased by about 5° per decade for all load directions. These changes with aging mainly occurred in the lower region (T6-12). The influence of sex on thoracic kyphosis and the RoM has been described as partly contradictory.

Following de-tensioning of the tendon constructs it was possible to quantify an endogenous re-tensioning. Further, it was demonstrated that the endogenous re-tensioning response was markedly blunted after interference with the cytoskeleton (inhibiting non-muscle myosin-dependent cell contraction by blebbistatin), which confirmed that re-tensioning was cell generated. When the constructs were elongated and held at a constant length a stress relaxation response was quantified, and removing 27% of the GAG content of tendon did not alter the relaxation behavior, which indicates that GAGs do not play a meaningful role in force transmission within this system.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Biomechanical gait analyses were conducted for 13 individuals with PD and 12 age-matched controls during comfortable (CWS) and maximal (MWS) speed walking. Relative contributions to total positive work from the hip, knee, and ankle were compared across groups and speeds. Within each group, relationships between relative joint work and CWS and MWS were also quantified. Significant group by speed interactions indicated that healthy older adults increased hip and decreased ankle relative work at MWS compared to CWS whereas relative work at all joints in PD group remained stable across speeds. In the older group, positive relationships were observed between relative hip work and MWS. In the PD group, negative relationships were observed between relative hip work and CWS and MWS. Healthy older adults disproportionately increased mechanical contributions from the hip at MWS compared to CWS. Individuals with PD did not exhibit similar disproportionate scaling of joint kinetics across speed conditions. Inability to appropriately scale joint kinetics in PD may represent an inflexible neuromuscular system in PD, which may limit walking performance in this population.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

SPS configurations differ depending on the proximal anastomosis location, which might lead to dissimilar coronary and upper body perfusions. Mathematical modeling can be used to explore the local and global hemodynamic effects of the SPSs. In literature there are few patient-specific models of SPS that specifically address the influence of both the local and peripheral vasculature. In this study, multi-domain models of univentricular circulations were developed to investigate local hemodynamics and flow distribution in the presence of two shunt configurations. We also analyzed the relative impact of local and peripheral vascular resistances on coronary perfusion and flows through the upper aortic branches. A two-step approach was followed. First, two patient-specific models were based on clinical data collected from univentricular patients having different shunts and peripheral vasculatures. Each model coupled a three-dimensional representation of SPS, aortic arch (AA) and pulmonary arteries, with a lumped parameter model (LPM) of peripheral vasculature closing the circulatory loop. Then, two additional models of hypothetical subjects were created by coupling each customized LPM with the other patient's three-dimensional anatomy. Flow rates and pressures predicted by the patient-specific models revealed overall agreement with clinical data. Differences in the local hemodynamics were seen during diastole between the two models. Varying the three-dimensional models, while keeping an identical LPM, led to comparable flow distribution through the AA, suggesting that peripheral vasculatures have a dominant effect on local hemodynamics with respect to the shunt configuration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Transport of specific contrast agents through cartilage has been investigated to elucidate cartilage quality. In laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical studies, imaging techniques such as magnetic imaging resonance (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and fluorescent microscopy have been widely employed to visualize and quantify solute transport in cartilage. Many parameters related to the physico-chemical properties of the solute, such as molecular weight, net charge and chemical structure, have a profound effect on the transport characteristics. Information on the interplay of the solute parameters with the imaging-dependent parameters (e.g. resolution, scan and acquisition time) could assist in selecting the most optimal imaging systems and data analysis tools in a specific experimental set up. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of various imaging systems to investigate solute transport properties in articular cartilage, by discussing their potentials and limitations.

Most of the tissue engineered heart valves have been developed for the low pressure pulmonary position because of the difficulties in fabricating a mechanically strong valve, able to withstand the systemic circulation. This necessitates the use of reinforcing scaffolds, resulting in a tissue-engineered textile reinforced tubular aortic heart valve. Therefore, to better design these implants, material behaviour of the composite, valve kinematics and its hemodynamical response need to be evaluated. Experimental assessment can be immensely time consuming and expensive, paving way for numerical studies. In this work, the material properties obtained using the previously proposed multi-scale numerical method for textile composites was evaluated for its accuracy. An in silico immersed boundary (IB) fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulation emulating the in vitro experiment was set-up to evaluate and compare the geometric orifice area and flow rate for one beat cycle. Results from the in silico FSI simulation were found to be in good coherence with the in vitro test during the systolic phase, while mean deviation of approximately 9% was observed during the diastolic phase of a beat cycle.

However, it is not well known how the viscoelastic and quasi-static material properties compare between the ligaments. The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare these material properties between the knee ligaments and patellar tendon. Dumbbell-shaped tensile test samples were cut from bovine knee ligaments (ACL, LCL, MCL, PCL) and patellar tendon (PT) and subjected to tensile testing (n = 10 per ligament type). A sinusoidal loading test was performed at 8% strain with 0.5% strain amplitude using 0.1, 0.5 and 1 Hz frequencies. Subsequently, an ultimate tensile test was performed to investigate the stress-strain characteristics. At 0.1 Hz, the phase difference between stress and strain was higher in LCL compared with ACL, PCL and PT (p < 0.05), and at 0.5 Hz that was higher in LCL compared with all other ligaments and PT (p < 0.05). PT had the longest toe-region strain (p < 0.05 compared with PCL and MCL) and MCL had the highest linear and strain-dependent modulus, and toughness (p < 0.05 compared with ACL, LCL and PT). The results indicate that LCL is more viscous than other ligaments at low-frequency loads. MCL was the stiffest and toughest, and its modulus increased most steeply at the toe-region, possibly implying a greater amount of collagen.

Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms of gait regulation, ethical and experimental challenges have prevented full exploration of these. Here we present data on the gait response of mice to rapid, precisely timed, spatially confined mechanical perturbations. Our data elucidate that after the mechanical perturbation, the mouse gait response is anisotropic, preferring deviations away from the trot towards bounding, over those towards other gaits, such as walk or pace. We quantified this shift by projecting the observed gait onto the line between trot and bound, in the space of quadrupedal gaits. We call this projection λ. For λ=0, the gait is the ideal trot; for λ=±π, it is the ideal bound. We found that the substrate perturbation caused a significant shift in λ towards bound during the stride in which the perturbation occurred and the following stride (linear mixed effects model: Δλ=0.26±0.07 and Δλ=0.21±0.07, respectively; random effect for animal, p < 0.05 for both strides, n = 8 mice). We hypothesize that this is because the bounding gait is better suited to rapid acceleration or deceleration, and an exploratory analysis of jerk showed that it was significantly correlated with λ (p < 0.05).

This study aimed to determine the effect of a user-driven treadmill control scheme on walking speeds, anterior ground reaction forces (AGRF), and trailing limb angles (TLA) of healthy adults. Twenty-three participants completed a 10-m overground walking task to measure their overground self-selected (SS) walking speeds. Then, they walked at their SS and fastest comfortable walking speeds on an instrumented split-belt treadmill in its fixed speed and user-driven control modes. The user-driven treadmill controller combined inertial-force, gait parameter, and position based control to adjust the treadmill belt speed in real time. Walking speeds, peak AGRF, and TLA were compared among test conditions using paired t-tests (α = 0.05). Participants chose significantly faster SS and fast walking speeds in the user-driven mode than the fixed speed mode (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the overground SS walking speed and the SS speed from the user-driven trials (p < 0.05). Changes in AGRF and TLA were caused primarily by changes in walking speed, not the treadmill controller. Our findings show the user-driven treadmill controller allowed participants to select walking speeds faster than their chosen speeds on the fixed speed treadmill and similar to their overground speeds.

The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of three different strategies for descending standard and increased height stairs: step-over-step (SoS), step-by-step (SbS) and side-step (SS) on lower limb kinetics in older people. Eleven participants (mean ± SD age: 74.8 ± 3.1 years, height: 1.63 ± 0.07 m, mass: 67.7 ± 9.5 kg) descended a four-step custom built instrumented staircase at a self-selected speed, adopting each of the three strategies, at two configurations: a step-rise height of 170 mm (standard; STD) and a step-rise height of 255 mm (increased; INC). 3D motion capture, synchronised with embedded force plates enabled the calculation of joint kinetics of lead and trail limbs. Data were analysed using a Linear Mixed Model with gait speed selected as a covariate during weight acceptance (WA) and controlled lowering (CL) phases. A large increase in hip extensor moment in both WA and CL in the lead limb was evident during both SoS and SbS at INC step height compared to STD (P < .015 for all), with no such increase in hip flexor moment evident in SS strategy (P = .519). Lead limb knee extensor moment decreased and plantarflexor moment increased in INC SoS compared to STD SoS during CL (P < .001 for both). In the trail limb, increased hip extensor and plantarflexor moments were seen in INC SS compared to STD SS (P < .001 for both). The alternate strategies result in the overall task demand being split between the lead limb (weight acceptance) and trail limb (controlled lowering).

Rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms is a major issue for public healthcare. A way to obtain an individual rupture risk assessment is a main objective of many research teams in the world. For many years, we have investigated the relationship between the mechanical properties of aneurysm wall tissues and the rupture risk. In this work, we try to go further and investigate rupture limit values.


METHODS
Following surgical clipping, a specific conservation protocol was applied to aneurysmal tissues in order to preserve their mechanical properties. Thirty-nine intracranial aneurysms (27 females, 12 males) were tested using a uniaxial tensile test machine under physiological conditions, temperature, and saline isotonic solution. These represented 24 unruptured and 15 ruptured aneurysms. Stress/strain curves were then obtained for each sample, and a fitting algorithm was applied following a Yeoh hyperelastic model with 2 parameters. Moreover, uniaxial tensile tests were conducted until rupture of samples to obtain values of stress and strain rupture limit.


RESULTS
The significant parameter a C2 of the hyperelastic Yeoh model, allowed us to classify samples' rigidity following the terminology we adopted in previous papers (Costalat et al., 2011; Sanchez et al., 2013): Soft, Stiff and Intermediate. Moreover, strain/stress rupture limit values were gathered and analyzed thanks to the tissue rigidity, the status of the aneurysm (initially ruptured or unruptured) and the gender of the patient.


CONCLUSION
Strain rupture limit was found quite stable around 20% and seems not to be correlated with the status of the aneurysm (initially ruptured or unruptured), neither with the gender of the patient. However, stretch and stress rupture limit seems not to be independent on the rigidity. The study confirms that ruptured aneurysms mainly present a soft tissue and unruptured aneurysms present a stiff material.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We employed a novel in vitro technique to measure the kinematics and laxity of TKR implants during gait, and measured how these characteristics are influenced by implant shape and soft tissue balancing, simulated using virtual ligaments. Compared with virtual ligaments that were equally balanced in flexion and extension, the largest changes in stance-phase tibiofemoral AP and IE kinematics occurred when the virtual ligaments were simulated to be tighter in extension (tibia offset 1.0 ± 0.1 mm posterior and 3.6 ± 0.1° externally rotated). Virtual ligaments which were tight in flexion caused the largest swing-phase changes in AP kinematics (tibia offset 2.3 ± 0.2 mm), whereas ligaments which were tight in extension caused the largest swing-phase changes in IE kinematics (4.2 ± 0.1° externally rotated). When AP and IE loads were superimposed upon normal gait loads, incremental changes in AP and IE kinematics occurred (similar to laxity testing); and these incremental changes were smallest for joints with virtual ligaments that were tight in extension (in both the stance and swing phases). Two different implant designs (symmetric versus medially congruent) exhibited different kinematics and sensitivities to superimposed loads, but demonstrated similar responses to changes in ligament balancing. Our results demonstrate the potential for pre-clinical testing of implants using joint motion simulators with virtual soft tissues to better understand how ligament balancing affects implant motion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to examine the changes of lower extremity kinetics during walk-to-run (WR) transition and if the changes would follow a non-linear trend within the five strides before WR transition using a constant acceleration protocol.


METHODS
Fourteen participants performed gait transition on the instrumented treadmill at a constant acceleration. Peak, time to peak, and movement and power of hip, knee and ankle joints were recorded and analyzed in sagittal plane for five strides before gait transition. Three Two-way MANOVA were employed to examine the differences of kinetic measures among the five strides. Univariate analysis and Post-Hoc Tukey's test would be applied if needed. Also, Post hoc polynomial trend analyses were used to examine the trend of the kinetic measures that significantly changed during the five strides.


RESULTS
Compared to the first four strides, significant differences were observed for peaks moments, joint powers, and time to peaks in the last stride before running at ankle, knee, and hip joints respectively. In general, the changes of kinetic variables were following a quadratic trend during the five strides before running.


CONCLUSION
Joint kinetic measures actively change in non-linear patterns during the five strides before running to prepare for the gait transition, indicating that the gait transition is an active reorganization rather than a passive reaction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To date, the contributions of these mechanisms have not been quantified for the response to an external postural disturbance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of measures that quantify the M2 contribution to anteroposterior fall recovery. We evaluated the whole-body rotation contribution, as well as a measure specific to arm motion (MARMS). With segment counter-rotation as the main focus of this study, we examined standing feet-in-place responses to treadmill-induced falls. The treatment validity of our measures was assessed by comparing unconstrained responses to those with constrained arm motion. The convergent validity of our measures was assessed by correlating peak shoulder flexion and extension velocities with counter-rotation contributions. Eleven unimpaired participants responded to anteroposterior belt accelerations from a treadmill, and the M2 and MARMS contributions were quantified from three-dimensional segment motion. The treatment validity of these measures was partially supported. Constraining the arms reduced M2 for anterior, but not posterior falls. Conversely, MARMS was reduced for posterior, but not anterior falls. Convergent validity was supported for MARMS (r = 0.64-0.78), but not M2 (r = -0.40 to -0.15). These results support the use of MARMS over M2 when interested in the role of arm motion. Given that arm constraints did not change the contribution of MARMS during a forward fall, unimpaired participants may not necessarily rely on arm motion as part of their recovery strategy in this context.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Different L-IBFD designs have been developed to accommodate various surgical approaches for lumbar interbody fusion procedures including anterior, lateral, posterior, and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions (ALIF, LLIF, PLIF, and TLIF, respectively). Due to design differences, there is a potential for mechanical performance differences between ALIF, LLIF, PLIF, and TLIF devices. To evaluate this, mechanical performance and device dimension data were collected from 124 Traditional 510(k) submissions to the FDA for L-IBFDs cleared for marketing from 2007 through 2016. From these submissions, mechanical test results were aggregated for seven commonly performed tests: static and dynamic axial compression, compression-shear, and torsion testing per ASTM F2077, and subsidence testing per ASTM F2267. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine if device type (ALIF, LLIF, PLIF, TLIF) had a significant effect on mechanical performance parameters (static testing: stiffness and yield strength; dynamic testing: runout load; subsidence testing: stiffness [Kp]). Generally, ALIFs and LLIFs were found to be stiffer, stronger, and had higher subsidence resistance than PLIF and TLIF designs. These results are likely due to the larger footprints of the ALIF and LLIF devices. The relative mechanical performance and subsidence resistance can be considered when determining the appropriate surgical approach and implant for a given patient. Overall, the mechanical performance data presented here can be utilized for future L-IBFD development and design verification.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although several material models can predict soft tissue behavior, complications may arise when these models are implemented into finite element (FE) programs, due to the addition of an arbitrary penalty parameter for numerically enforcing material incompressibility. Herein, an inverse methodology was developed in MATLAB to use previously published stress-strain data from experimental planar equibiaxial testing of five biomaterials used in heart valve cusp replacements, in conjunction with commercial explicit FE solver LS-DYNA, to optimize the material parameters and the penalty parameter for an anisotropic hyperelastic strain energy function. A two-parameter optimization involving the scaling constant of the strain energy function and the penalty parameter proved sufficient to produce acceptable material responses when compared with experimental behaviors under the same testing conditions, as long as analytically derived material constants were available for the other non-optimized parameters and the actual tissue thickness was not much less than 1 mm.

To address these issues, we investigated the calcification of immature chick bone under static tensile stretch using a newly developed real-time observation bioreactor system. Bone slices perpendicular to the longitudinal axis obtained from the tibia in 2- to 4-day-old chick legs were cultured in the system mounted on a microscope, and their calcification was observed up to 24 h while they were stretched in the direction parallel to the slice. Increase in the calcified area, traveling distance and the direction of the calcification and collagen fiber orientation in the newly calcified region were analyzed. There was a significant increase in calcified area in the bone explant subjected to tensile strain over ∼3%, which corresponds to the threshold strain for collagen fibers showing alignment in the direction of stretch, indicating that the fiber alignment may enhance tissue calcification. The calcification progressed to a greater distance to the stretching direction in the presence of the loading. Moreover, collagen fiber orientation in the calcified area in the loaded samples was coincided with the progression angle of the calcification. These results clearly show that the application of static tensile strain enhanced tissue calcification, which progresses along collagen fibers aligned to the loading direction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For girls, circum-menarcheal growth is critical, with around 50% of adult bone acquired over a 4-year period. Here, we prospectively followed 10 gymnasts and 12 age-matched non-gymnasts across approximately 4 years circum-menarche. A combination of pQCT and subject-specific finite element models were used to measure differences in bone acquisition and structure between the groups, and to determine the degree to which specific mechanical factors predict change in bone structure. At baseline, gymnasts had stronger bone, including 26% higher BMC, 51% greater compressive strength, and 21% higher trabecular density. Over the study period, both groups more than doubled their bone strength. Pre-menarcheal principal stresses predicted change in pQCT variables for non-gymnasts, but not gymnasts. The bone of non-gymnasts became more asymmetrical than the bone of gymnasts. Our results suggest that exposure to the diverse, intense mechanical signals of gymnastic loading during adolescence imparts substantial benefits to bone geometry and mechanical function. Specifically, the bone of gymnasts is better able to resist loading from multiple directions, and operates with a higher factor of safety compared to non-gymnasts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Experimental data of thirteen human full vertebrae (i.e., with posterior elements) and twelve vertebral bodies were obtained from two existing studies. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was calculated from 2D projection images of the 3D HR-pQCT scan of the specimens mimicking clinical DXA scans. Stochastic predictors, sill variance and correlation length, were calculated from their experimental variogram. Vertebral strength was measured as the maximum failure load of human vertebrae and vertebral bodies from mechanical tests. Vertebral strength correlated significantly with sill variance (r = 0.727) and correlation length (r = 0.727) for the vertebral bodies, and with correlation length (r = 0.593) for full vertebrae. However, the stochastic predictors improved the strength prediction made by aBMD alone by only 11% for the vertebral bodies while no improvement was observed for the full vertebrae. Despite a correlation, classical variogram parameters such as sill variance and correlation length do not enhance the prediction of in vitro vertebral strength beyond aBMD.

Resultant muscle forces for active wrist motions with and without actuating the APL were compared. The absence of APL resulted in higher forces in FCR and ECRL – the synergists of APL – and lower forces in ECU – the antagonist of APL. The altered distribution of wrist muscle forces observed in the absence of active APL control could significantly alter the efficacy of in vitro experiments conducted on wrist simulators, in particular when investigating those surgical reconstructions or rehabilitation of the wrist heavily reliant on the APL, such as treatments for basal thumb osteoarthritis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In knee osteoarthritis, these outcomes have been used to understand knee pathomechanics, but the complexity of an inverse dynamic model may limit the uptake of joint moments in some clinical and research structures. The objective was to determine whether discrete features of the sagittal and frontal plane knee moments calculated using inverse dynamics compare to knee moments calculated using a cross product function. Knee moments from 74 people with moderate knee osteoarthritis were assessed after ambulating at a self-selected speed on an instrumented dual belt treadmill. Standardized procedures were used for surface marker placement, gait speed determination and data processing. Net external frontal and sagittal plane knee moments were calculated using inverse dynamics and the three-dimensional position of the knee joint center with respect to the center of pressure was crossed with the three-dimensional ground reaction forces in the cross product function. Correlations were high between outcomes of the moment calculations (r > 0.9) and for peak knee adduction moment, knee adduction moment impulse and difference between peak flexion and extension moments, the cross product function resulted in absolute values less than 10% of those calculated using inverse dynamics in this treadmill walking environment. This computational solution may allow the integration of knee moment calculations to understand knee osteoarthritis gait without data collection or computational complexity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Understanding how different cardiac diseases alter the flow physics in the left ventricle may therefore provide a powerful tool for disease detection. In this work, the fluid dynamics in the left ventricle subject to different severities of aortic regurgitation is experimentally investigated by performing time-resolved particle image velocimetry in a left heart duplicator. Diastolic vortex reversal was observed in the left ventricle accompanied by an increase in viscous energy dissipation. Vortex dynamics and energy dissipation may provide useful insights on sub-optimal flow patterns in the left ventricle.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, functional movement variability is also a result of compensation mechanisms e.g. to account for prior movement deviations and is, therefore, crucial for stable movements. The aim of this study was to analyze functional variability during motor learning of a complex cyclic task. Thirteen young participants practised riding a Pedalo® slalom until they were able to complete the task without errors. Since trunk movements are controlled with high priority, we analyzed trunk kinematics as a result parameter. Since lower extremities affect the result parameter, foot, thigh and pelvis kinematics are considered execution parameters. The movement variability for result and execution parameters was determined for the first (poor performance), an intermediate (medium performance) and the last (good performance) training sessions. Furthermore, the variability ratio (execution/result parameter) was calculated as a measure of functional variability. Movement variability of the result parameter decreased significantly with increasing expertise. In contrast, movement variability of all execution parameters increased significantly from measurements representing poor to medium performance. No change from medium to good performance was found. Functional variability increased over time in all execution parameters. Since the movement variability of all execution parameters did not decrease with increasing Pedalo performance, applying a traditional interpretation approach of movement variability would have led to completely wrong conclusions. Possible mechanisms explaining the increased movement variability are discussed. The variability ratio seems to be the only parameter that can reveal improved sensorimotor functioning during all analyzed stages of motor learning.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to develop a method for the assessment of tribological performance of osteochondral grafts within an in vitro whole natural joint simulation model. The study assessed the effects of osteochondral allograft implantation (existing surgical intervention for the repair of osteochondral defects) on the wear, deformation and damage of the opposing articular surfaces. Tribological performance of osteochondral grafts was compared to the natural joint (negative control), an injury model (focal cartilage defects) and stainless steel pins (positive controls). A recently developed method using an optical profiler (Alicona Infinite Focus G5, Alicona Imaging GmbH, Austria) was used to quantify and characterise the wear, deformation and damage occurring on the opposing articular surfaces. Allografts inserted flush with the cartilage surface had the lowest levels of wear, deformation and damage following the 2 h test; increased levels of wear, deformation and damage were observed when allografts and stainless steel pins were inserted proud of the articular surface. The method developed will be applied in future studies to assess the tribological performance of novel early stage osteochondral interventions prior to in vivo studies, investigate variation in surgical precision and aid in the development of stratified interventions for the patient population.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Though commonly used, ratio scaling often results in an over-correction. Allometric scaling has previously been suggested for kinetic variables but its effectiveness in partialing out the effect of anthropometrics is unknown due to a lack of consistent application. This study examined the effectiveness of allometric scaling vertical, braking and propulsive GRF and loading rate for 84 males and 47 females while running at 4.0 m/s. Raw, unfiltered data were ratio scaled by body mass (BM), height (HT), and BM multiplied by HT (BM∗HT). Gender specific exponents for allometric scaling were determined by performing a log-linear (for BM and HT individually) or log-multilinear regression (BMHT). Pearson productmoment correlations were used to assess the effectiveness of each scaling method. Ratio scaling by BM, HT, or BM∗HT resulted in an over-correction of the data for most variables and left a considerable portion of the variance still attributable to anthropometrics. Allometric scaling by BM successfully removed the effect of BM and HT for all variables except for braking GRF in males and vertical GRF in females. However, allometric scaling for BMHT successfully removed the effect of BM and HT for all reactionary forces in both genders. Based on these results, allometric scaling for BMHT was the most appropriate scaling method for partialing out the effect of BM and HT on kinetic variables to allow for effective comparisons between groups or individuals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is the most common joint shape abnormality at birth, with many risk factors for the condition being associated with restricted fetal movement. In this study, we investigate the biomechanics of fetal movements in such situations, namely fetal breech position, oligohydramnios and primiparity (firstborn pregnancy). We also investigate twin pregnancies, which are not at greater risk of DDH incidence, despite the more restricted intra-uterine environment. We track fetal movements for each of these situations using cine-MRI technology, quantify the kick and muscle forces, and characterise the resulting stress and strain in the hip joint, testing the hypothesis that altered biomechanical stimuli may explain the link between certain intra-uterine conditions and risk of DDH. Kick force, stress and strain were found to be significantly lower in cases of breech position and oligohydramnios. Similarly, firstborn fetuses were found to generate significantly lower kick forces than non-firstborns. Interestingly, no significant difference was observed in twins compared to singletons. This research represents the first evidence of a link between the biomechanics of fetal movements and the risk of DDH, potentially informing the development of future preventative measures and enhanced diagnosis. Our results emphasise the importance of ultrasound screening for breech position and oligohydramnios, particularly later in pregnancy, and suggest that earlier intervention to correct breech position through external cephalic version could reduce the risk of hip dysplasia.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Differences between groups with and without SDK have been demonstrated, focusing on the amount of scapular motion at specific degrees of humeral elevation. However, this approach does not consider the temporal information and shape of the scapular motion temporal series. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may clarify this variability and advance current understanding of 'abnormal' movement patterns. This study aimed to evaluate the scapular kinematics in patients with shoulder pain and in asymptomatic participants with and without SDK using PCA. Data were collected in 98 participants separated in four groups: Pain + SDK (n = 24), Pain (n = 25), No Pain + SDK (n = 24), and No Pain (n = 25). Scapulothoracic kinematic data were measured with an electromagnetic tracking device during arm elevation and lowering phases. PCA and analysis of variance were used to compare the groups. The No Pain + SDK group had a progressive increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase compared to the Pain (effect size = 0.79) and No Pain (effect size = 0.80) groups. During the arm-lowering, the Pain + SDK group had a progressive increasing in anterior tilt over this phase in comparison to the No Pain + SDK group (effect size = 0.68). Therefore, PCA demonstrated differences in the scapular anterior tilt related to SDK and shoulder pain. The presence of SDK revealed a scapular pattern with progressive increasing in anterior tilt over the elevation phase. However, during the arm-lowering phase, asymptomatic participants with SDK changed their motion pattern, unlike the symptomatic group, reinforcing the suggested association between scapular modifications and shoulder symptoms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This property of muscle contraction is known as residual force enhancement (RFE). Here, we aimed to determine whether neural factors may mask some of the mechanical benefits of RFE on plantar flexion torque production. Inherent to lengthening contractions is an increase in cortical and spinal-mediated inhibition, while knee flexion places the medial gastrocnemius at a neuromechanical disadvantage. Neuromuscular properties of the plantar flexors were investigated with a Humac Norm dynamometer in 10 males (∼27 years) with a flexed (90°) and extended (180°) knee and with or without calcaneal tendon vibration (frequency range: 80-110 Hz). There was no effect for vibration (p > 0.05), but there was an effect for knee angle (p < 0.05) such that there was a 2 fold increase in RFE with the knee flexed compared with extended. During submaximal torque matching, following active lengthening there was an activation reduction (electromyography; EMG) of 7.2 and 4.7% with the knee flexed and extended, respectively for soleus as compared with the reference isometric contraction, but no difference for the medial gastrocnemius. Despite attempting to excite Ia input onto the plantar flexor motor neuron pool, vibration had no influence on RFE. Surprisingly, RFE was elevated more for the knee flexed than extended, which was possibly owing to the activation differences across the disparate muscles of the triceps surae during the plantar flexion task.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The task combines aspects of single-limb balance and the lower-extremity dexterity test by asking participants to stand on one limb while compressing an unstable spring with the contralateral limb to an individualized target force. Nineteen non-disabled participants completed the study, and performance measures for the demands of each limb - balance and dexterous force control - as well as kinematic and electromyographic measures of trunk control were collected. Given five practice trials, participants achieved compression forces ranging from 100 to 139 N (mean 121.2 ± 12.3 N), representing 14.4-23.0% of body weight (mean 18.7 ± 2.4%), which were then presented as target forces during test trials. Dexterous force control coefficient of variation and average magnitude of the center of pressure (COP) resultant velocity were associated such that greater variability in force control was accompanied by greater COP velocity (R = 0.598, p = 0.007). Trunk coupling, quantified as the coefficient of determination (R2) of a frontal plane thorax and pelvis angle-angle plot, varied independently of any measure of balance or dexterous force control. The Balance-Dexterity Task is a continuous, dynamic balance task where bipedal coordination and trunk coupling can be concurrently observed and studied.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to compare the in vivo 3D kinematics and component placement between bilateral and unilateral THA patients during gait. Eight bilateral and thirty-three unilateral THA patients were evaluated for both hips during treadmill gait using a validated combination of 3D computer tomography-based modeling and dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS). The in vivo 3D kinematics of the unilateral THA group was first assessed. The magnitudes of kinematics and component placement difference between implanted hips in the bilateral THA group and between the implanted and non-implanted hips in the unilateral THA group were compared. The study results showed asymmetric gait kinematics in the unilateral THA group. Although the magnitude of kinematics differences between sides for both the bilateral and unilateral THA groups did not change significantly for hip rotations (p > 0.05), the bilaterally operated THA group has significantly lower magnitude of hip gait translation difference. Significant reduction in the magnitude of the acetabular cup adduction, stem adduction, and combine hip anteversion and adduction difference was observed in the bilateral THA group (p < 0.05). Our findings demonstrated that despite significant improvements of component placement and reduced magnitude of hip gait translation difference between implanted hips in the bilateral THA group, asymmetric hip kinematic rotations persisted in patients with bilateral THA during gait.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Whether and/or how much such changes in the response of TNS to alteration in stability demand of the task alter spinal stiffness remains unclear. To address this research gap, a repeated measure study was conducted on twenty gender-balanced asymptomatic individuals to evaluate changes in trunk bending stiffness throughout the lumbar spine's range of flexion following alterations in both stability and equilibrium demands of a load holding task. Trunk bending stiffness was determined using trunk stiffness tests in upright posture on a rigid metal frame under different equilibrium and stability demands on the lower back. Increasing the stability demand by increasing the height of lifted load ∼30 cm only increased trunk bending stiffness (∼39%) over the lower range of lumbar flexion and under the low equilibrium demand condition. Similarly, increasing the equilibrium demand of the task by increasing the weight of lifted load by 3.5 kg only increased trunk bending stiffness (55%) over the low range of lumbar flexion and under the low stability demand condition. Our results suggest a non-linear relationship between changes in stability and equilibrium demands of a task and the contribution of TNS to trunk bending stiffness. Specifically, alterations in TNS response to changes in stability and equilibrium demand of a given task will increase stiffness of the trunk only if the background stiffness is low.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False
