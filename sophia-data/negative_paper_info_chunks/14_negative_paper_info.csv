In this system, telencephalic neurons in HVC present a state-dependent, highly selective response to auditory presentations of the bird’s own song (BOS). This property provides an opportunity to study the neural code behind a complex motor behavior. In this work, we explore whether changes in the temporal structure of the sound envelope can drive changes in the neural responses of highly selective HVC units. We generated an envelope-modified BOS (MOD) by reversing each syllable’s envelope but leaving the overall temporal structure of syllable spectra unchanged, which resulted in a subtle modification for each song syllable. We conducted in vivo electrophysiological recordings of HVC neurons in anaesthetized zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Units analyzed presented a high BOS selectivity and lower response to MOD, but preserved the profile response shape. These results show that the temporal evolution of the sound envelope is being sensed by the avian song system and suggest that the biomechanical properties of the vocal apparatus could play a role in enhancing subtle sound differences.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This ability may be important for the owls when catching prey. We performed a quantitative experiment in the laboratory and trained owls in a task in which the owls had to discriminate whether two rhombi presented simultaneously on a computer monitor were of the same or of different sizes. We obtained full data sets with two experienced owls and one data point with a third owl. For objects being sufficiently larger than the spatial resolution of the barn owl, the angular threshold was related to object size, implying that the discrimination followed Weber’s law. The range of Weber fractions we determined was between 0.026 and 0.09. For object sizes close to the spatial resolution, performance degraded. We conducted similar experiments with human subjects. Human thresholds showed the same dependence on object size, albeit down to smaller object sizes. Human performance resulted in a range of Weber fractions extending from 0.025 to 0.036. The differences between owls and humans could be explained by the much higher spatial acuity of humans compared with owls.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this study, averaged EEGs were measured using surface electrodes placed on the head in six different configurations while dolphins performed an echolocation task. Simultaneously, biosonar click emissions were measured using contact hydrophones on the melon and a hydrophone in the farfield. The averaged EEGs revealed an electrophysiological potential (the pre-auditory wave, PAW) that preceded the production of each biosonar click. The largest PAW amplitudes occurred with the non-inverting electrode just right of the midline—the apparent side of biosonar click generation—and posterior of the blowhole. Although the source of the PAW is unknown, the temporal and spatial properties rule out an auditory source. The PAW may be a neural or myogenic potential associated with click production; however, it is not known if muscles within the dolphin nasal system can be actuated at the high rates reported for dolphin click production, or if sufficiently coordinated and fast motor endplates of nasal muscles exist to produce a PAW detectable with surface electrodes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Because ectotherm locomotor performance depends on temperature, rattlesnakes could use prey temperature to evaluate the potential of lizards to evade attacks. Here, we tested whether hunting rattlesnakes use infrared information to (1) detect and (2) evaluate prey before attack. We expected thermal contrast between prey and background to be the best predictor of predatory behaviour under the prey detection hypothesis, and absolute prey temperature under the prey evaluation hypothesis. We presented lizard carcasses of varying temperatures to free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) and scored behavioural responses as a function of thermal contrast, absolute lizard temperature, and light level. Thermal contrast and light level were the most salient predictors of snake behaviour. Snakes were more likely to respond to lizards and/or respond at greater distances at night and when thermal contrast was high, supporting the known prey detection function of infrared sensing. Absolute lizard temperature was not an important predictor of snake behaviour; thus, we found no evidence for temperature-based prey evaluation. Infrared sensing is still poorly understood in ecologically relevant contexts; future research will test whether rattlesnakes learn to evaluate prey based on temperature with experience.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The putative mechanism relies on the high pH sensitivity of teleost hemoglobin (Hb), intracellular red blood cell (RBC) pH regulation via β-adrenergic Na+/H+ exchanger (β-NHE) activity, and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase at the tissues that short-circuits RBC pH regulation. Previous studies have shown that in rainbow trout, this system may double Hb–O2 unloading to red muscle compared to a situation without short-circuiting. The present study determined that: (1) in rainbow trout this system may be functional even at low concentrations of circulating catecholamines, as shown by conducting a dose–response analysis; (2) Atlantic and coho salmon also possess β-NHE activity, as shown by changes in hematocrit in adrenergically stimulated cells; and (3) with β-NHE short-circuiting, Atlantic and coho salmon may be able to increase Hb–O2 unloading by up to 74 and 159%, respectively, as determined by modeling based on O2 equilibrium curves. Together, these results indicate that a system to enhance Hb–O2 unloading may be common among salmonids and may be operational even under routine conditions. In view of the life histories of Atlantic and coho salmon, a system to enhance Hb–O2 unloading during exercise may help determine a successful spawning migration and thus reproductive success.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, phenotypes also depend on the relations between genomes and environment. In our experimental system, we observed differential response to environmental factors defined by different conditions of husbandry in a semi-barrier unit or in a SPF (specific pathogen free) barrier unit, which resulted in partial reversal of phenotypes previously observed under semi-barrier conditions. To provide an update of basic phenotypes in unselected and randomly mated controls (DUC) and long-term selected DUhTP (Dummerstorf high treadmill performance) mice in the SPF facility, we compared growth parameters, reproductive performance, the accretion of muscle and fat mass, physical activity, and running performance as well as food intake in all experimental groups. For selected parameters, the comparative analysis spans more than 30 generations. In DUC mice, under SPF conditions a more than threefold (P < 0.0001) higher subcutaneous fat mass, higher muscle mass by about 25% (P < 0.0001), but lower epididymal fat mass in DUhTP mice by about 20% (P < 0.0001) were observed. In SPF husbandry, body weight increased to a stronger extent in adult DUC mice (≈ 20%; P < 0.0001) than in DUhTP mice (≈ 8%; P = 0.001). The concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBPs in the serum as well as the liver weights were similar in all experimental groups, indicating growth effects independent of the somatotropic axis. Under SPF conditions the litter size at birth increased in DUC mice (P < 0.001) but not in DUhTP mice. The differential effect of husbandry on body weights at day 21 and concentrations of triglycerides in the serum of our model were due to the different diets used in the semi-barrier and in the SPF facility. Our results demonstrate differential trait response to environmental factors resulting in partial phenotype conversion in our experimental system. The existence of conditional phenotypes as a result of genotype–environment interactions points to the importance of environmental factors in functional genome analysis.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The hormonal effects on song pattern are likely mediated by androgen receptors (AR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), ligand activated transcription factors that are expressed in neurons of various areas of the songbirds’ vocal control circuit. The distribution of AR in this circuit is rather similar between species while that of ERα is species variant and concerns a key vocal control area, the HVC (proper name). We discuss the regulation of the expression of the cognate AR and ERα and putative splice variants. In particular, we suggest that transcription factor binding sites in the promoter of these receptors differ between bird species. Further, we suggest that AR- and ERα-dependent gene regulation in vocal areas differs between species due to species-specific DNA binding sites of putative target genes that are required for the transcriptional activity of the receptors. We suggest that species differences in the distribution of AR and ERα in vocal areas and in the genomic sensitivity to these receptors contribute to species-specific hormonal regulation of the song.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, whether fathers respond differently to their own pups and to alien ones remains unclear.

The numbers of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the medial preoptic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex were significantly increased when fathers were exposed to an alien pups; however, more brain regions such as paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, lateral habenula, ventral lateral septal nucleus, and medial amygdaloid nucleus showed increased number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons activated when the fathers were exposed to their own pups. Exposure to their own pups also induced a greater number of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, paraventricular nucleus, hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, lateral habenula, ventral lateral septal nucleus and medial amygdaloid nucleus, as well as higher expression of oxytocin and vasopressin in the paraventricular nucleus, compared with exposure to alien pups.

Here, we investigated the post-mating changes in behavioral and antennal responses of Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) females to host plant volatiles. In two-choice bioassays using artificial plant models, mated females visited the model scented with synthetic blends (15-, 9-, or 6-components) of cabbage plant volatiles more frequently than the unscented control, whereas virgin females did not exhibit this preference. Because single compounds and the 3-component blend did not induce preferential visiting, mated females apparently utilized complex odor blends as their host-finding cue. Moreover, 2- to 4-day-old mated females visited the models, scented and unscented, more frequently than did their virgin counterparts. Therefore, mating enhanced the host-finding behavior of young females and their responsiveness to plant volatiles. Gas chromatography–electroantennographic detector analysis revealed that eight of the 15 compounds in the cabbage plant volatiles elicited responses from female antennae. However, post-mating and age-dependent changes in antennal responses were not detected. Because female peripheral (antennal) sensitivity to volatiles remained practically unchanged after emergence, post-mating changes in host selection might be attributed to changes in the central nervous system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In some species they function as sensors of ambient light intensity, from which information is relayed to various parts of the nervous system, e.g., for the control of circadian rhythms. In this work we have investigated the possibility that the ocellar light stimulation changes the properties of the optomotor performance of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. We used a virtual reality environment where a panoramic moving image is presented to the cockroach while its movements are recorded with a trackball. Previously we have shown that the optomotor reaction of the cockroach persists down to the intensity of moonless night sky, equivalent to less than 0.1 photons/s being absorbed by each compound eye photoreceptor. By occluding the compound eyes, the ocelli, or both, we show that the ocellar stimulation can change the intensity dependence of the optomotor reaction, indicating involvement of the ocellar visual system in the information processing of movement. We also measured the cuticular transmission, which, although relatively large, is unlikely to contribute profoundly to ocellar function, but may be significant in determining the mean activity level of completely blinded cockroaches.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It thrives in ion-poor, often acidic Amazonian waters and exhibits excellent regulation of physiology down to water pH 4.0. Curiously, however, it is reported to perform poorly in aquaculture at pH 8.0, an only slightly alkaline pH which would be benign for most freshwater fish. In initial experiments with Tambaqui of intermediate size (30–50 g), we found that ammonia excretion rate was unchanged at pH 4, 5, 6, and 7, but elevated after 20–24 h at pH 8, exactly opposite the pattern seen in most teleosts. Subsequent experiments with large Tambaqui (150–300 g) demonstrated that only ammonia, and not urea excretion was increased at pH 8.0, and that the elevation was proportional to a general increase in MO2. There was an accompanying elevation in net acidic equivalent excretion and/or basic equivalent uptake which occurred mainly at the gills. Net Na+ balance was little affected while Cl− balance became negative, implicating a disturbance of Cl− versus base exchange rather than Na+ versus acid exchange. Arterial blood pH increased by 0.2 units at pH 8.0, reflecting combined metabolic and respiratory alkaloses. Most parameters recovered to control levels by 18–24 h after return to pH 6.0. With respect to large Tambaqui, we conclude that a physiology adapted to acidic pH performs inappropriately at moderately alkaline pH. In small Tambaqui (4–15 g), the responses were very different, with an initial inhibition of ammonia excretion rate at pH 8.0 followed by a subsequent restoration of control levels. Elevated ammonia excretion rate occurred only after return to pH 6.0. Furthermore, MO2, plasma cortisol, and branchial vH+ATPase activities all declined during pH 8.0 exposure in small Tambaqui, in contrast to the responses in larger fish. Overall, small Tambaqui appear to cope better at pH 8.0, a difference that may correlate with their natural history in the wild.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Particularly in lizards, color polymorphism is associated with differential behaviors and reproductive strategies, which are evident in mature males during the mating season. Dominant males generally have greater endurance, higher body temperature, and larger bodies than submissive males, so they can acquire and defend larger territories and have greater access to females for mating. We studied whether the color morphs observed in males of one of the world’s southernmost reptiles, Liolaemus sarmientoi, are related to behavioral variation during agonistic interactions, thermal physiology, morphology, and/or locomotor stamina. Liolaemus sarmientoi males exhibit three color morphs: red (RR), red–yellow (RY), and yellow (YY). These lizards exhibit subtle behavioral displays and we did not observe stamina differences among morphs. However, we found that RR males are more aggressive than YY males during agonistic encounters. In addition, greater body temperature change during trials, higher field body temperatures, and greater head sizes of RR males compared to RY or YY indicate that RR is a dominant morph, which may influence their ability to acquire and defend territory and tactics for achieving reproductive success.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In the case of birdsong production, a delicate and fast control of several muscles is required to control the configuration of the syrinx (the avian vocal organ) and the respiratory system. In particular, the syringealis ventralis muscle is involved in the control of the tension of the vibrating labia and thus affects the frequency modulation of the sound. Nevertheless, the translation of the instructions (which are electrical in nature) into acoustical features is complex and involves nonlinear, dynamical processes. In this work, we present a model of the dynamics of the syringealis ventralis muscle and the labia, which allows calculating the frequency of the generated sound, using as input the electrical activity recorded in the muscle. In addition, the model provides a framework to interpret inter-syllabic activity and hints at the importance of the biomechanical dynamics in determining behavior.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These behavioral changes are thought to improve predator avoidance. For example, marine and estuarine crustacean zooplankton become more sensitive to light after kairomone exposure, which likely deepens their vertical distribution into darker waters during the day and thereby reduces their visibility to fish predators. Here, we show that kairomones from an estuarine fish induce similar behavioral responses in adult brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) from an endorheic, hypersaline lake, Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA. Given downwelling light stimuli, kairomone-exposed A. franciscana induce a descent response upon dimmer light flashes than they do in the absence of kairomones. Using extracellular electroretinogram (ERG) recordings, we also find that kairomones induce physiological changes in the retina that may lead to increased visual sensitivity, suggesting that kairomone-induced changes to photobehavior are mediated at the photoreceptor level. However, kairomones did not induce structural changes within the eye. Although A. franciscana inhabit endorheic environments that are too saline for most fish, kairomones from an estuarine fish amplify photobehavior in these branchiopod crustaceans. The mechanism for this behavioral change has both similarities to and differences from that described in marine malacostracan crustaceans.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We studied the individuals’ age, growth rates, age at sexual maturity, and maximum life span of the viviparous lizard Phymaturus antofagastensis, endemic of cold and harsh environments at high altitudes in the Andes Mountains of Catamarca province, Argentina. We also estimated key life history parameters like reproductive effort, lifetime reproductive effort, net reproductive rate, and relative reproductive time in P. antofagastensis as well as in other Phymaturus to compare the interplay among growth, maintenance, and reproduction in species that live across a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient. We found that females and males of P. antofagastensis mature late in life, at 6–7 years old, respectively, and some individuals reached 20 years of age. Adult females showed higher specific growth rates than males and an adult life span of 9 years which, due to their biennial reproduction, results in an estimated production of only four litters in life. This species exhibits one of the highest lifetime reproductive efforts described for lizards. Our results indicate the existence of a tradeoff between the number of reproductive events throughout life and reproductive effort devoted to each event in Phymaturus, related to the phylogenetic group.

Androgens such as testosterone bind to androgen receptors (AR) to induce physiological changes in the size, strength, and energetic capacity of skeletal muscles, which can directly influence the performance of behaviors in which those muscles are used. Because tissues differentially express AR, resulting in tissue-specific sensitivity to androgens, AR expression may be a major target of selection for the evolution of behavior. Anolis lizards (i.e., anoles) provide a robust system for the study of androgen-regulated traits, including the behavioral traits that facilitate social display and locomotion. In this study, we examined six anole species that demonstrate significant variation in the behavioral use of the forelimbs to measure the proportion of myonuclei in the bicep muscles that express AR. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we found that species with a greater proportion of nuclei positive for AR expression in the biceps exhibited greater frequencies of locomotor movements and pushup displays.

We also evaluated the effect of nest age and nest distance to water on body condition and blood parameters of nesting females. Body condition and plasmatic concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, lactate and uric acid of nesting females were significantly different from those of non-nesting females and males in C. crocodilus, but not in M. niger. Our study also demonstrated that nest age and distance to water had a negative effect on female body condition in C. crocodilus, but not in M. niger. Female C. crocodilus attending older nests or nests built further away from permanent water bodies tended to have lower body condition. Our results demonstrate that the nesting strategy of C. crocodilus has a metabolic cost associated with nest attendance for nesting females, which appear to depend on accumulated energetic reserves during nest attendance.

Typically, water-breathers reduce arterial pH by altering plasma [HCO3−], whilst air-breathers rely on ventilatory adjustments to modulate arterial PCO2. However, no studies have investigated whether the shift from water- to air-breathing within a species changes the mechanisms for temperature-induced pH regulation. Here, we used the striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus to examine how pH regulation is affected by water- versus air-breathing, since P. hypophthalmus can accommodate all gas exchange by its well-developed gills in normoxic water, but achieves the same metabolic rate with aerial oxygen uptake using its the swim-bladder when exposed to aquatic hypoxia. We, therefore, measured arterial acid–base status in P. hypophthalmus as temperature changed between 20 and 35 °C in either normoxic or severely hypoxic water. In normoxic water, where P. hypophthalmus relied entirely on branchial gas exchange, P. hypophthalmus exhibited the typical teleost reduction in plasma [HCO3−] and arterial pH when temperature rose. However, when forced to increase air-breathing in hypoxic water, arterial PCO2 fell due to a branchial hyperventilation, but it increased with temperature most likely due to passive CO2 retention. We propose that the rise in arterial PCO2 reflects a passive consequence of the progressive transition to air breathing at higher temperatures, and that this response fortuitously matches the new regulated pHa, relieving the requirement for branchial ion exchange.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Even though juvenile and adult birds are endothermic and maintain a constant, high body temperature by means of internal heat production, they begin life expressing an ectothermic phenotype. Depending on where a species falls along a continuum of maturity at hatching, from precocial to altricial, they begin to express endothermic traits either close to the time of hatching or as nestlings over a period of 1–3 weeks. Developing endothermy requires attaining a high basal metabolic rate and associated aerobic scope to produce sufficient internal heat, insulation to retain the internally produced heat, and a thermostat that “turns on” heat production in response to cooling ambient temperatures. To support the high metabolic costs of endothermy, the animal must have the capacity to deliver sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the heat-generating tissues. In this review, we examine the development of physiological and morphological traits that are required for endothermy and discuss their potential to limit the development of endothermy. These include ventilatory and cardiovascular function, contribution of visceral organ masses, membrane lipid composition, substrate supply pathways, and skeletal muscle physiology. The developmental trajectories of each of these systems in precocial and altricial species can have significant effects on the development of an endothermic phenotype.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We examined whether Xenopus laevis tadpoles and froglets employ such a strategy by characterizing their swimming pattern in a square tank with shallow water. Trajectories obtained from video recordings were analysed for proximity to the nearest wall. With the exception of young larvae, the vast majority of animals (both tadpoles and froglets) spent a disproportionately large amount of time near the wall. The total distance covered was not a confounding factor, but animals were stronger wall followers in smaller tanks. Wall following was also not influenced by whether the surrounding walls of the tank were black or white, illuminated by infrared light, or by the presence or absence of tentacles. When given a choice in a convex tank to swim straight and leave the wall or turn to follow the wall, the animals consistently left the wall, indicating that wall following in X. laevis is barrier-driven. This implies that wall following behaviour in Xenopus derives from constraints imposed by the environment (or the experimenter) and is unlikely a strategy for spatial learning or safety seeking.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

With the availability now of many animal genomes and sophisticated bioinformatics tools, we are experiencing a new wave of fundamental research into the ways in which hormones influence the cellular transcriptome to define those genes and gene networks on which hormones act to modify cellular function and behavior. Where these approaches have become especially exciting is that we have come more and more to appreciate just how many individual tissues within a single organism can be targets of a particular hormone to influence the animal’s behavioral phenotype. We also now appreciate that some signals that were once considered just hormones are seen to be essential neural-to-neural signals and thus not really hormones at all (Saldanha et al. 2011; Mitre et al. 2017). Some hormones seem to act on virtually every significant tissue in the body and perform a myriad of functions by a multiplicity of mechanisms and control of innumerable tissue-specific genes and gene networks. Altogether, these various hormonal actions serve to control many facets of behavior. While a focus on how and when hormones are released into the bloodstream remains a popular area of research, it is these latter mechanistic functions that are of current greatest interest, including on free-living animals. While we are generally familiar with the clinical implications of advances in endocrine physiology, they are also of great interest to biologists asking diverse questions about the anatomical, physiological and behavioral capabilities of wild animals. Evolutionary biologists consider the ways in which endocrine systems participate in Endocrinology is traditionally defined as the study of chemical signals present in blood that act on target tissues at some distance from the tissue source of the signal. These chemical signals, or hormones, can produce innumerable effects on those target tissues, from effects that occur locally and almost instantly, to some that impact tissues massively and last a lifetime. That degree of influence is dictated by numerous factors starting with the time and amount of hormone released into the circulatory system and ending with the diverse cellular mechanisms through which the hormones influence cell and tissue function (Nelson 2015). The early years of behavioral endocrine research placed a significant focus on the steroid hormones and on determining the amounts of hormone in blood. In some cases, wild vertebrates were the subjects, illustrated by classic summary works such as that of Farner and Wingfield (1980). Alongside these kinds of studies were others aimed at elucidating hormone-dependent intracellular signaling pathways, work largely utilizing laboratory or domesticated animal models (e.g., O’Malley 1984). Such studies also revealed the significant role for enzyme-catalyzed reactions that, by their",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

What spatiotemporal transformation of visual stimuli into cortical activity arises from such tangle of malleable cortical inputs and intracortical connections? To address this question, we obtained band-pass filtered extracellular recordings of neural activity in turtle dorsal cortex during visual stimulation of the retina. We discovered important spatial and temporal features of stimulus-modulated cortical local field potential (LFP) recordings. Spatial receptive fields span large areas of the visual field, have an intricate internal structure, and lack directional tuning. The receptive field structure varies across recording sites in a distant-dependent manner. Such composite spatial organization of stimulus-modulated cortical activity is accompanied by an equally multifaceted temporal organization. Cortical visual responses are delayed, persistent, and oscillatory. Further, prior cortical activity contributes globally to adaptation in turtle visual cortex. In conclusion, these results demonstrate convoluted spatiotemporal transformations of visual stimuli into stimulus-modulated cortical activity that, at present, largely evade computational frameworks.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, aromatase, the key enzyme for estrogen synthesis, although it is more abundant in males, is expressed and active in the brain of females where it is regulated by similar mechanisms as in males. Early work had shown that estrogens produced in the ventromedial hypothalamus are involved in the regulation of female sexual behavior in musk shrews. However, the question of the role of central aromatase in general had not received much attention until recently. Here, I will review the emerging concept that central aromatization plays a role in the regulation of physiological and behavioral endpoints in females. The data support the notion that in females, brain aromatase is not simply a non-functional evolutionary vestige, and provide support for the importance of locally produced estrogens for brain function in females. These observations should also have an impact for clinical research.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Most of the people, academic and non-academic, of the Munich Institute of Zoology with Karl von Frisch as its director were still around, when I took up my studies there in 1959, 11 years after Franz had started. This gives me a particular depth of understanding and amusement when reading all the stories he reports. Later, in 1962, when I arrived in Ted Bullock’s laboratory at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) on the fourth floor of the Zoology building (to stay there for more than a year), Franz had just left a few months earlier after having spent some 11 months as a postdoc there. We shared quite a few dear friends for a lifetime, which we both had first met at UCLA. And we even had our civil marriages at the same place at Ruppertstrasse in Munich, both to a Swabian. Most likely Franz, like me, was asked whether he would like to have the ceremony with or without harmonium, the difference being 5 DM (Deutschmarks). More importantly, we shared our interest in neuroethology and the invertebrates, always advocating the necessity of an organismic and integrative approach. Franz once charmingly promoted our valued experimental animal, the spider Cupiennius salei, to the status of an “honorary insect”. We always had something to laugh about and enjoyed the commonality of our Bavarian roots, which included a specific sense for enjoying life or “pura vida”, as I learned in Costa Rica. At the same time Franz Huber was a dedicated, ambitious and hard-working scientist. He pioneered neuroethology, searching for the neuronal and sensory basis of behavior. Already in his doctoral thesis work (Fig. 1) under the guidance of Werner Jacobs in Munich Franz managed with remarkable success to elicit complex song patterns and various behaviors associated with Clearly, it was a rich life, of which one can say that to be a scientist not only is a profession but also or even more so a way of living. Franz Huber provides abundant proof of that. In his older days as an emeritus professor he wrote his memoires on as many as 467 pages, with scrutiny, charm, lots of anecdotes and photographs, both personal and scientific and many of them of historical value now (Huber 2016). The reader of this book learns about all the stages of Franz Huber’s very active and successful life. It started in Nussdorf, close to Traunstein, a small Bavarian village, then of some 600 inhabitants, and ends in idyllic Starnberg close to Munich (Bavaria). On 11th April 2017 Franz sent me a touching e-mail congratulating me on my forthcoming birthday. Despite some physical fragility a little more than two weeks before he passed away, approaching his 92nd birthday, Franz was still perfectly alert, curious, and open for the many colors and beauty of life and for nature’s depths. His last e-mail to me contained both a poem and a list of intriguing questions concerning the insect brain. When I read through his book “Das war mein Leben” (Huber 2016), I was moved and caught, realizing what I had not thought of for a long time, namely that our paths, though different and mine with some 15 years delay, showed some surprising relatedness.

In male goldfish, testosterone (T) rapidly increases approach responses to the visual cues of females through its conversion to estradiol. Because aromatase is expressed in the retina, we tested if T can acutely influence retina responses to visual stimuli, and investigated the receptor mechanisms that may mediate such effects. Specifically, we measured FOS protein immunoreactivity to determine if T affects cellular responses to visual stimuli that include females, and used electrophysiology to investigate whether T can generally affect light sensitivity. We found that T acutely increased FOS responses to the simultaneous onset of light and the presence of female visual stimuli, both of which would normally be associated with early morning spawning, and increased electrophysiological responses to low intensity light pulses. Both effects were blocked by an estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) antagonist, indicating that T is likely being converted to estradiol (E2) and acting through an ERβ mediated mechanism to acutely modulate visual processing. Changes in sensory processing could subsequently influence approach behavior to increase reproductive success in competitive mating environments.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The purpose of this study was to confirm changes of body temperature (Tb) and thermoregulatory parameters upon inhibition of neural activity in hypothalamic subregions in freely moving rats. In addition, the pattern of monoamine release in these nuclei was measured during active thermoregulation using microdialysis. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was perfused into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), or posterior hypothalamus (PH) at two different ambient temperatures (5 or 23 °C). Using telemetry, we continuously measured the Tb and the heart rate (HR) as an index of heat production as well as locomotor activity (Act). Tail skin temperature (Ttail) was also continuously measured as an index of heat loss. Although the perfusion of TTX into hypothalamic subregions had no effect on any of the measured thermoregulatory parameters at an ambient temperature of 23 °C, it induced significant Tb decrease under cold conditions only when perfused into the DMH and the PH. In contrast, the HR decreased only after perfusion of TTX into the PH during cold conditions, while the Ttail and Act remained unchanged. Serotonin (5-HT) in the DMH and dopamine (DA) metabolite 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the PH, but not noradrenaline, increased significantly during exposure to cold temperatures.

Stroke volume is affected by heart rate along with central and peripheral venous pressures. In the present study, we investigated the heart rate dependency of cardiac filling in turtles, along with the changes in venous pressures that accompany ventilation. Experimental reductions in heart rate of anaesthetised turtles (Trachemys scripta) by the specific bradycardic agent zatebradine (2–3 mg kg−1) resulted in an elevation of stroke volume that compensated cardiac output. By contrast, in spontaneously ventilating turtles, stroke volume remained constant, even during the transitions from the pronounced bradycardia during breath-hold diving to the accelerated heart rate associated with spontaneous ventilation. Ventilation was associated with pronounced decreases in visceral, pericardial and central venous pressure, all of which became sub-ambient (especially during inspiration) and may provide a powerful ‘suctional’ element to cardiac filling. In addition, mean circulatory filling pressure, an index of vascular capacitance and the peripheral driving pressure for venous return, was increased by infusion of adrenaline (2.5 µg kg−1). Together these data demonstrate that changes in both central and peripheral venous pressures are key determinants of venous return that, in concert with direct regulation of the heart, contribute to the large scope for cardiac output in turtles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To date, no studies exist on how a single species, capable of inhabiting both fresh and saltwater, responds to hypercarbia, at rest or during sustained exercise. Rainbow trout was acclimated to soft water (in mmol l− 1: Na+, 0.08; Cl−, 0.05; pH 6.7–6.8), hard water (in mmol l− 1: Na+, 2.4; Cl−, 0.2; pH 7.9–8.0), or 85% saltwater (28 ppt) (in mmol l− 1: Na+, 410; Cl−, 476; pH 7.8–8.0).

The production mechanisms of these signals are poorly understood in birds, despite emerging evidence that volatile compounds from preen oil may serve as chemosignals. Steroid hormones, including testosterone (T), may influence the production of these signals, yet variation in circulating T only partly accounts for this variation. We hypothesized that odor is a T-mediated signal of an individual’s phenotype, regulated in part by androgen sensitivity in the uropygial gland. We quantified natural variation in chemosignals, T, uropygial gland androgen sensitivity, and aggressive behavior in dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). The interaction between circulating T and androgen receptor transcript abundance significantly correlated with volatile concentrations in male, but not female, preen oil. In both sexes, odorant variables correlated with aggressive response to an intruder. Our results suggest that preen oil volatiles could function as signals of aggressive intent, and, at least in males, may be regulated by local androgen receptor signaling in the uropygial gland. Because these behavioral and chemical traits have been linked with reproductive success, local regulation of androgen sensitivity in the periphery has the potential to be a target of selection in the evolution of avian olfactory signaling.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Steroid receptors and metabolism are control points for evolutionary changes in sexual dimorphism. Electric communication signals of South American knifefishes are a model for understanding the evolution and physiology of sexually dimorphic behavior. These signals are regulated by gonadal steroids and controlled by a simple neural circuit. Sexual dimorphism of the signals varies across species. We used transcriptomics to examine mechanisms for sex differences in electric organ discharges (EODs) of two closely related species, Apteronotus leptorhynchus and Apteronotus albifrons, with reversed sexual dimorphism in their EODs. The pacemaker nucleus (Pn), which controls EOD frequency (EODf), expressed transcripts for steroid receptors and metabolizing enzymes, including androgen receptors, estrogen receptors, aromatase, and 5α-reductase. The Pn expressed mRNA for ion channels likely to regulate the high-frequency activity of Pn neurons and for neuromodulator and neurotransmitter receptors that may regulate EOD modulations used in aggression and courtship. Expression of several ion channel genes, including those for Kir3.1 inward-rectifying potassium channels and sodium channel β1 subunits, was sex-biased or correlated with EODf in ways consistent with EODf sex differences.

However, the relationship between alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activities, key ethanol metabolizing enzymes, and hypoxia tolerance among Carassius spp. and their closely related non-ethanol-producing cyprinids remains unclear. To address this, we quantified the activity levels of key anaerobic enzymes in liver and muscle in species of cyprinids over 48 h of severe hypoxia exposure (0.7 kPa). As predicted, muscle ADH activity was highest in the two most hypoxia-tolerant species (Carassius spp.), with very low levels present in the other species examined. However, liver ADH activities showed an inverse relationship with hypoxia tolerance, with the most hypoxia-tolerant fish having the lowest ADH activity. There was no correlation between hypoxia tolerance and ALDH and LDH activities in muscle or liver. All species produced lactate, reaching their highest levels after 8 h, but returning to near-baseline levels by 48 h of sustained exposure to hypoxia, suggesting lactate oxidation or depressed ATP demand. Liver glycogen content was not affected by 48 h hypoxia exposure in the most hypoxia-tolerant species, whereas the least tolerant species consumed the majority of the liver glycogen stores, which is probably due to the greater relative hypoxia exposure experienced by these species. Our findings that liver ADH activities were inversely related to hypoxia tolerance suggests that in all but Carassius spp., the ethanol metabolizing pathways in cyprinids is largely similar to that observed in other vertebrates and plays a role in the detoxification of ethanol. Furthermore, conservation of glycogen stores may be the result of metabolic-depressing pathways in the more tolerant species, regardless of the ability to produce ethanol, or adaptations that improve oxygen uptake to reduce metabolic demands due to hypoxia.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

As a result, biologists have long recognized that many of the mechanisms that support these phenotypes—particularly the androgenic system—is evolutionarily labile, and thus susceptible to the effects of selection for different traits. However, exactly how androgenic signaling systems vary in a way which results in dramatically different functional outputs, remain largely unclear. We explore this topic here by outlining four key—but non-mutually exclusive—hypotheses that propose how the mechanisms of androgenic signaling might change over time to potentiate the emergence of phenotypical variation in masculine behavior and physiology. We anchor this framework in a review of our own studies of a tropical bird called the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus), which has evolved an exaggerated acrobatic courtship display that is heavily androgen-dependent. The result is an example of how the cellular basis of androgenic action can be modified to support a unique reproductive repertoire.

We found that ABR amplitude increased with increasing stimulus level, which is consistent with results in other avian species. ABR amplitudes, latencies, and thresholds indicate that the hearing range of Northern saw-whet owls extends from 0.7 to 8.6 kHz, with an extended frequency range of best sensitivity between 1.6 and 7.1 kHz. Sensitivity fell off rapidly above and below these frequencies. The average audiogram was structurally similar to those found in other species of owls, suggesting that phylogeny or morphology may be constraining the frequency range of auditory sensitivity. However, ABR thresholds were 10–25 dB lower than those of Eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio), with thresholds below 0 dB SPL in some individuals.

Yet, how the physiology of an animal changes to support a new or modified signal is a question that has remained largely unanswered. Androgens are important in regulating male reproductive behavior, therefore, selection for particular signals may drive the evolution of increased androgenic sensitivity in the neuro-motor systems underlying their production. Studies of the neuroendocrine mechanisms of anuran sexual signaling provide evidence to support this idea. Here, we highlight two such cases: first, a large body of work in Xenopus frogs demonstrates that sexually dimorphic androgen receptor (AR) expression in the laryngeal nerves and muscles underlies sexually dimorphic vocal behavior, and second, our own work showing that the recent evolution of a hind limb signal (known as the “foot flag”) in Staurois parvus is accompanied by a dramatic increase in androgenic sensitivity of the thigh muscles that control limb movement. Together, these examples illustrate that the evolutionary modification or gain of a sexual signal is linked with a novel pattern of AR expression in the tissues that support it.

There was a response in fecal corticosterone 1 day post-injection, but the control males showed a similar response indicating a handling effect. Fecal cortisol levels did not indicate a response to the ACTH challenge, and were significantly lower than corticosterone concentrations.

We tested the hypothesis that foraging mode (FM) is a determinant factor on the interspecific variation of SMR despite the phylogenetic relationship among species. We demonstrated that FM predicted SMR, but there is also a partial phylogenetic structuration of SMR in snakes. We also detected that evolution rates of SMR in active foragers seem to be higher than ambush-hunting snakes. We suggested that foraging mode has a major effect over the evolution of SMR in snakes, which could represent an ecophysiological co-adaptation, since ambush hunters (with low feeding rates) present a lower maintenance energetic cost (SMR) when compared to active foragers. The higher SMR evolution rates for active foraging snakes could be related to a higher heterogeny in the degree of activity during hunting by active foragers when compared to ambush-hunting snakes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It is, therefore, important to understand their physiological mechanisms of low-temperature survival. Acclimation to moderate–low temperature can improve cold tolerance, and pre-acclimation to mild desiccation can also improve survival of a subsequent cold exposure. However, very few studies have assessed the combined actions of cold and drought acclimations. In the present study, we combined cold acclimation with drought acclimation making it possible to assess the interactions between effects of these two stressors using the springtail Protaphorura fimata as a model organism. We investigated the interacting effects of drought and cold acclimation on body fluid osmolality, membrane phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and cold-shock tolerance. Acclimation to mild drought (− 2.46 MPa) increased body fluid osmolality from 0.33 to 1.25 Osm at all acclimation temperatures (5, 10, 15, or 20 °C) likely due to accumulation of the compatible osmolytes, trehalose, and alanine. Interestingly, the expected positive effect of drought acclimation on cold-shock tolerance was only evident at high acclimation temperature (20 °C), whereas at intermediate temperatures (10 and 15 °C), there was an interaction between acclimation temperature and drought. At 5 °C, no effect of drought acclimation on cold-shock tolerance was observed despite high osmolality. The positive effect of drought acclimation at 20 °C on subsequent cold-shock survival coincided with a drought-induced effect on PLFA composition only detectable at high temperature. We discuss the possible roles of drought-induced compatible osmolytes and an altered PLFA composition in the cold-shock tolerance of arthropods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Densities of cardiac ICa and INa and their acute heat tolerance were measured in winter-acclimatized (WiR) and summer-acclimatized (SuR) fish maintained in the laboratory at 4 ± 1 and 18 ± 1 °C, respectively. A robust L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL), but no T-type Ca2+ current, was present in roach atrial and ventricular myocytes. Peak density of ICaL was smaller in atrial (− 1.97 ± 0.14 and − 1.75 ± 0.19 pA/pF for WiR and SuR, respectively) than ventricular myocytes (− 4.00 ± 0.59 and − 2.88 ± 0.47 pA/pF for WiR and SuR, respectively) (p < 0.05), but current density and heat tolerance of ICaL did not change between seasons in either cell type. In contrast to ICa, marked differences appeared in INa between WiR and SuR. INa density was 38% higher in WiR than SuR atrial myocytes (− 80.03 ± 5.92 vs. − 49.77 ± 4.72 pA/pF; p < 0.05) and 48% higher in WiR than SuR ventricular myocytes (− 39.25 ± 3.06 vs. − 20.03 ± 1.79 pA/pF; p < 0.05). The winter increase in INa density was associated with 55% (1.70 ± 0.27 vs. 0.77 ± 0.12) and 54% (1.08 ± 0.19 vs. 0.50 ± 0.10) up-regulation of the total Na+ channel (scn4 + scn5 + scn8) transcripts in atrium and ventricle, respectively (p < 0.05). Heat tolerance of atrial INa was lower in WiR with a breakpoint temperature of 20.3 ± 1.2 °C than in SuR (23.8 ± 0.7 °C) (p < 0.05). The response of INa to seasonal acclimatization conforms to the TDEE hypothesis. The lower heat tolerance of INa in WiR is consistent with the lower heat tolerance of in vivo heart rate in WiR in comparison to SuR, but the match is not quantitatively perfect, suggesting that other factors in addition to INa may be involved.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We tested the hypothesis that skin permeability is altered to maintain water balance through changes in water permeability and skin thickness during salinity acclimation and/or when fish emerse, using the euryhaline, amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus as a model. We first recorded the behaviour of fish out of water to determine which part of the cutaneous surface was in contact with the substrate. Fish spent about 70% of their time on their ventral surface when out of water. Osmotic permeability of the skin was assessed in fish acclimated to 0.3 or 45‰ using 3H2O fluxes in an in vitro micro-Ussing chamber setup. In freshwater-acclimated fish, 3H2O influx across the skin was significantly higher compared to hypersaline-acclimated fish, with no significant changes in efflux. Prolonged emersion (7 days) resulted in an increase in skin 3H2O influx, but not efflux in fish acclimated to a moist 45‰ substrate. In a separate experiment, dorsal epidermal skin thickness increased while the ventral dermis thickness decreased in fish emersed for over a week. However, there was no link between regional skin thickness and water flux in our experiments. Taken together, these findings suggest that K. marmoratus alter skin permeability to maximize water uptake while emersed in hypersaline conditions, adjustments that probably help them survive months of emersion during the dry season when drinking to replace water loss is not possible.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Anterograde axonal filling illustrates the unilateral innervation on the medial ventral surface of the pumping muscle of the antennal heart via the paired corpora cardiaca nerve III. In addition, antibody staining revealed that ascending axons of this nerve terminate at the ampullae of the antennal heart forming synaptoid structures and extensive neurohaemal release sites. Due to the innervation by two dorsal unpaired median neurons, the presence of the biogenic amines octopamine and tyramine could be visualized by immunocytochemistry in an insect antennal heart for the first time. The data suggest that tyramine acts as a precursor and not purely as an independent transmitter. While the octopaminergic fibers innervating the pumping muscle of the antennal heart indicate a cardioregulatory role, we conclude that octopamine released from the neurohaemal area is pumped into the antennae and an involvement in the modulation of the antennal sensory sensitivity is discussed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested the hypothesis that honey bees sense the polarity of magnetic fields. We created an engineered magnetic anomaly in which the magnetic field generally either converged toward a sugar reward in a watch glass, or away from it. After bees in behavioral field studies had learned to associate this anomaly with a sugar water reward, we subjected them to two experiments performed in random order. In both experiments, we presented bees with two identical sugar water rewards, one of which was randomly marked by a magnetic field anomaly. During the control experiment, the polarity of the magnetic field anomaly was maintained the same as it was during the training session. During the treatment experiment, it was reversed. We predicted that bees would not respond to the altered anomaly if they were sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. Our findings that bees continued to respond to the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was in its unaltered state, but did not respond to it when its polarity was reversed, support the hypothesis that honey bees possess a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Presumably, gut structure and function should match diet to ensure adequate nutrient and energy uptake to maintain performance. Within CRT, dietary biochemical composition is the most important factor affecting gut structure and function in vertebrates. We fed Danio rerio (zebrafish) diets ranging from high- to moderate- to low-quality (i.e., ranging from high-protein, low-fiber to low-protein, high-fiber), and observed how gut length and surface area, as well as the activity levels of digestive enzymes (amylase, maltase, trypsin, aminopeptidase, and lipase) shifted in response to these dietary changes. Fish on the low-quality diet had the longest guts with the largest intestinal epithelial surface area and enterocyte cellular volumes. Fish on the moderate-quality diet had intermediate values of most of these parameters, and fish on the high-quality diet, the lowest. These data largely support CRT. Digestive enzyme activity levels were generally elevated in fish fed the moderate- and low-quality diets, but were highest in the fish fed the moderate-quality diet, suggesting that a diet with protein levels closest to that of the natural diet of D. rerio (they are omnivorous in nature) may elicit the best gut performance. However, fish fed the carnivore diet reached the largest terminal body size. Our results support CRT in terms of gut structure; however, our enzyme results do not necessarily agree with CRT and largely depend on which enzyme is discussed. In particular, the evidence for lipase activities being elevated in the fish fed the low-protein, high-fiber diet perhaps reflects a lipid-scavenging mechanism in fish consuming high-fiber foods rather than CRT.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we investigated whether a phylogenetically distantly related avian species, the carrion crow, with similar socio-cognitive abilities to human and non-human primates, exhibits a face inversion effect. In a delayed matching-to-sample task, two crows had to differentiate profiles of crow faces as well as matched controls, presented both upright and inverted. Because crows can discriminate humans based on their faces, we also assessed the face inversion effect using human faces. Both crows performed better with crow faces than with human faces and performed worse when responding to inverted pictures in general compared to upright pictures. However, neither of the crows showed a face inversion effect. For comparative reasons, the tests were repeated with human subjects. As expected, humans showed a face-specific inversion effect. Therefore, we did not find any evidence that crows—like humans—process faces as a special visual stimulus. Instead, individual recognition in crows may be based on cues other than a conspecific’s facial profile, such as their body, or on processing of local features rather than holistic processing.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Large compound eyes of Periplaneta americana contain photoreceptors of two spectral classes, broadband green-sensitive photoreceptors and narrow-band UV-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we investigated how visual stimulation by UV and green light affects locomotor, resting, and grooming behaviors in P. americana under conditions when light avoidance is not possible. We show that green but not UV light stimulates locomotor activity, inducing paradoxical positive masking. Duration of resting and grooming decreased with increasing light intensity, consistent with development of behavioral stress in response to visual overstimulation. A reaction of full immobility is described under UV light and at higher intensities of green light, with relative periods of immobility and grooming strongly negatively correlated. Low-intensity UV was more effective than low-intensity green light in suppressing grooming and inducing immobility. Our results suggest that locomotor activity in P. americana is mainly regulated by green-sensitive photoreceptors, and that dim UV light can trigger behavioral immobility, whereas both wavelengths induce stress-like reactions at high intensities. Considering the intrinsic UV sensitivity of green-sensitive photoreceptors, the contrasting behavioral responses indicate antagonistic interactions between UV and green visual channels.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The amount of information available to support these tasks is, in part, dictated by the spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of their visual systems. Here, we investigate the absolute limits of these visual properties for visually guided position and speed control in Bombus terrestris. Our results indicate that the limit of spatial vision in the translational motion detection system of B. terrestris lies at 0.21 cycles deg−1 with a peak contrast sensitivity of at least 33. In the perspective of earlier findings, these results indicate that bumblebees have higher contrast sensitivity in the motion detection system underlying position control than in their object discrimination system.

These typically set strict limits on the capacity of an animal to discriminate between colour stimuli imposed by physiological characteristics of the visual system and different assumptions about the underlying mechanisms of colour processing by the brain. Such physiologically driven models were not designed to accommodate sigmoidal-type discrimination functions as those observed in recent behavioural experiments. Unfortunately, many of the fundamental assumptions on which commonly used colour models are based have been tested against empirical data for very few species and many colour vision studies solely rely on physiological measurements of these species for predicting colour discrimination processes. Here, we test the assumption of a universal principle of colour discrimination only mediated by physiological parameters using behavioural data from four closely related hymenopteran species, considering two frequently used models. Results indicate that there is not a unique function describing colour discrimination by closely related bee species, and that this process is independent of specific model assumptions; in fact, different models produce comparable results for specific test species if calibrated against behavioural data.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In Spodoptera littoralis, pre-exposure of males to the sex pheromone has been shown to increase the sensitivity of the olfactory sensory neurons at peripheral level. In this study, we have investigated this sensitization effect by recording the electroantennographic responses of male antennae to the major sex pheromone component (Z,E)-9,11-tetradecadienyl acetate and to the minor components (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate and (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate. Responses to the conjugated diene acetate at 1 and 10 µg and to the unconjugated ester at 10 µg at three different times (11, 22 and 33 min) after pre-exposure (T = 0 min) were significantly higher than those at T = 0, whereas no increase of sensitivity to the pheromone was elicited by any dose of the minor monoene acetate. In addition, pre-exposed antennae to sub-threshold amounts (0.1, 1 and 10 ng) of the major pheromone component also induced an increased response to the chemical at different times (5 and 15 min) after exposure. Our results revealed that pre-exposed isolated antennae display a short-term higher sensitivity at the peripheral level when compared to naive antennae. In addition, we provide evidence of a peripheral sensitization mediated not only by the major pheromone component, but also by the minor unconjugated diene acetate, and the induction of this sensitivity appears to be dependent on the pre-exposure dose and the time span between pre-exposure and subsequent recordings. Possible implications of the sensitization effect displayed by the minor component for a more effective discrimination of the pheromone bouquets of other closely related species are highlighted.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The olfactory code consists of combinatorial activation patterns across sensory neurons, thus its capacity exceeds the number of involved classes of sensory neurons by a manifold. Activation patterns are not static but vary over time, caused by the temporally complex response dynamics of the individual sensory neuron responses. We systematically analyzed the temporal dynamics of olfactory sensory neuron responses to a diverse set of odorants. We find that response dynamics depend on the combination of sensory neuron and odorant and that information about odorant identity can be extracted from the time course of the response. We also show that new response dynamics can arise when mixing two odorants. Our data show that temporal dynamics of odorant responses are able to significantly enhance the coding capacity of olfactory sensory systems.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The effect of varying parameters is especially unclear in fish studies, the majority of which use simple sound types and then extrapolate to natural conditions. The current study investigated AEPs in goldfish (Carassius auratus) using sounds of different durations (5, 10, and 20 ms) and frequencies (200, 500, 600 and 700 Hz) to test stimulus effects on latency and thresholds. We quantified differences in latency and threshold in comparison to a 10-ms test tone, a duration often used in AEP fish studies. Both response latency and threshold were significantly affected by stimulus duration, with latency patterning suggesting that AEP fires coincident with a decrease in stimulus strength. Response latency was also significantly affected by presentation frequency. These results show that stimulus type has important effects on AEP measures of hearing and call for clearer standards across different measures of AEP. Duration effects also suggest that AEP measures represent summed responses of duration-detecting neural circuit, but more effort is needed to understand the neural drivers of this commonly used technique.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

DGCs are gas exchange patterns consisting of alternating breath-hold periods and bouts of gas exchange. While all insects are capable of displaying a continuous pattern of gas exchange, this episodic pattern is known to occur within only some groups of insects and then only sporadically or during certain phases of their life cycle. Investigations into DGCs have tended to emphasise the role of chemosensory thresholds in triggering spiracle opening as critical for producing these gas exchange patterns. However, a chemosensory basis for episodic breathing also requires an as-of-yet unidentified hysteresis between internal respiratory stimuli, chemoreceptors, and the spiracles. What has been less appreciated is the role that the insect’s central nervous system (CNS) might play in generating episodic patterns of ventilation. The active ventilation displayed by many insects during DGCs suggests that this pattern could be the product of directed control by the CNS rather than arising passively as a result of self-sustaining oscillations in internal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. This paper attempts to summarise what is currently known about insect gas exchange regulation, examining the location and control of ventilatory pattern generators in the CNS, the influence of chemoreceptor feedback in the form of O2 and CO2/pH fluctuations in the haemolymph, and the role of state-dependent changes in CNS activity on ventilatory control.

While we have an understanding of multimodal signal production, we know relatively less about receiver filtering of multimodal signals and whether filtering capacity in one modality influences filtering in a second modality. Most multimodal signals contain a temporal element, such as change in frequency over time or a dynamic visual display. We examined the relationship in temporal resolution across two modalities to test whether females are (1) sensory ‘specialists’, where a trade-off exists between the sensory modalities, (2) sensory ‘generalists’, where a positive relationship exists between the modalities, or (3) whether no relationship exists between modalities. We used female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) to investigate this question as males court females with an audiovisual display. We found a significant positive relationship between female visual and auditory temporal resolution, suggesting that females are sensory ‘generalists’.

Periodic arousals to normal Tb are energetically expensive, so hibernators trade off arousal benefits against energetic costs. This is especially important for bats with white-nose syndrome (WNS), a fungal disease causing increased arousal frequency. Little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with WNS show upregulation of endogenous pyrogens and sickness behaviour. Therefore, we hypothesized that WNS should cause a fever response characterized by elevated Tb. Hibernators could also accrue some benefits of arousals with minimal Tb increase, thus avoiding full arousal costs. We compared skin temperature (Tsk) of captive Myotis lucifugus inoculated with the WNS-causing fungus to Tsk of sham-inoculated controls. Infected bats re-warmed to higher Tsk during arousals which is consistent with a fever response. Torpid Tsk did not differ. During what we term “cold arousals”, bats exhibited movement following Tsk increases of only 2.2 ± 0.3 °C, compared to >20 °C increases during normal arousals. Cold arousals occurred in both infected and control bats, suggesting they are not a pathophysiological consequence of WNS. Fever responses are energetically costly and could exacerbate energy limitation and premature fat depletion for bats with WNS. Cold arousals could represent an energy-saving mechanism for both healthy and WNS-affected bats when complete arousals are unnecessary or too costly. A few cold arousals were observed mid-hibernation, typically in response to disturbances. Cold arousals may, therefore, represent a voluntary restriction of arousal temperature instead of loss of thermoregulatory control.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We sampled blood (n = 248) and urine (n = 319), performed an erythrocyte haemogram and visually determined the presence of haemoglobinuria. Reproduction leads to increased mortality in edible dormice and our study now reveals severe haematological impairments during reproduction that were associated with nutrient and energy deficits and stress. These effects were even more pronounced in subsequent reproductive years, indicating prolonged physiological impairment. Under limited food availability, the rate of erythrocyte generation was reduced. This seems to be part of an energy saving strategy instead of representing a poor body condition as survival probability in this species is high in years of low food availability. A high prevalence ratio of haemoglobinuria (up to 85%) at the end of the active season indicated amplified erythrocyte destruction through haemolysis. This may be the result of a preparative mechanism to avoid massive oxidative damage during the long hibernation period. Most ecophysiological studies so far focus on single erythrocyte parameters on a short time scale, which could be misleading. Our results clearly highlight that a wide-array RBC approach is a powerful tool for investigating mechanisms underlying physiological performance and fitness, also for other vertebrate taxa.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Vitamin D plays a central role in calcium homeostasis of most vertebrates, and is obtained in different species through diet, dermal synthesis, or a combination of both. The aim of this study was to determine the predominant routes of Vitamin D synthesis in three disparate species, brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli), tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri). We surveyed plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3, analysed environmental conditions and life history factors, and determined the ability of skin samples to synthesise Vitamin D3 on exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation. There was variation in the plasma/serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations between and within the species studied, with wild kiwi having the lowest concentrations and NZ sea lions the highest. Kiwi skin produced small but measurable amounts of Vitamin D3, while tuatara skin produced Vitamin D3 concentrations higher than that of kiwi. New Zealand sea lion skin produced the highest amount of Vitamin D3 and differed from the other two species in this study in that Vitamin D3 was present in skin before UV-B exposure. The results from this study show that all three species studied retained the ability to use both dietary and dermal sources of Vitamin D, although there was interspecies variation in the magnitude of dermal synthesis. Comparisons between these species show that there are differences in their Vitamin D pathways, but suggest that there are more factors contributing to these pathways than might be expected solely from life history characteristics.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Wasps displaced within their probable foraging grounds returned to their nests on the day of release although they oriented randomly upon release; however, wasps fed before release returned sooner, displaying nest-ward orientation. When displaced to places far from their nests, thus expected to be unfamiliar, only a third returned on the day of release showing nest-ward orientation; others oriented randomly and either returned on subsequent days or never. When confined within mosquito-net tents since eclosion and later released to places close to their nests (but unfamiliar), even fed wasps oriented randomly, and only older wasps returned, taking longer time. Thus, contrary to insects inhabiting less-featured landscapes, R. marginata foragers appear to have thorough familiarity with their foraging grounds that enables them to orient and home efficiently after passive displacement. Their initial orientation is, however, determined by an interaction of the information acquired from surrounding landscape and their physiological motivation. With age, they develop skills to home from unfamiliar places. Homing behaviour in insects appears to be influenced by evolutionarily conserved mechanisms and the landscape in which they have evolved.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

How a receiver’s central nervous system integrates multiple signal components remains largely unknown. We investigated how female green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) integrate the multiple spectral components present in male advertisement calls. Typical calls have a bimodal spectrum consisting of formant-like low-frequency (~0.9 kHz) and high-frequency (~2.7 kHz) components that are transduced by different sensory organs in the inner ear. In behavioral experiments, only bimodal calls reliably elicited phonotaxis in no-choice tests, and they were selectively chosen over unimodal calls in two-alternative choice tests. Single neurons in the inferior colliculus of awake, passively listening subjects were classified as combination-insensitive units (27.9%) or combination-sensitive units (72.1%) based on patterns of relative responses to the same bimodal and unimodal calls. Combination-insensitive units responded similarly to the bimodal call and one or both unimodal calls. In contrast, combination-sensitive units exhibited both linear responses (i.e., linear summation) and, more commonly, nonlinear responses (e.g., facilitation, compressive summation, or suppression) to the spectral combination in the bimodal call. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nonlinearities play potentially critical roles in spectral integration and in the neural processing of multicomponent communication signals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Using intracellular recording coupled with dye injection, we found that bumblebee LMCs morphologically resemble those found in the honeybee, although only the LMC type L1 cells could be morphologically matched directly between the species. LMCs could also be classified on the basis of their light response properties as spiking or non-spiking.

Accordingly, the algorithms for evaluating such courtship signals are shaped by sexual selection and should reflect the expected benefits and costs of mating: signals bearing heterospecific features should be rapidly rejected, since mating would produce no fertile offspring, while signals resembling conspecific ones should be weighted proportional to mate quality. We test these hypotheses in females of the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus who assess males by their song, which is produced as a sequence of subunits with species and individual specific signatures. We present mixed sequences of subunits with conflicting cues and use a computational model of decision-making to infer how sensory information is weighted and integrated over the song. Consistent with our hypothesis, females do weight sensory cues according to the expected fitness benefits/costs: heterospecific subunits are weighted particularly negatively and lead to a rejection of the male early in the song. Conspecific subunits are weighted moderately, permitting a more complete evaluation of the full song. However, there exists an overall negative bias against mating, possible causes of which are discussed.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Herein, we aim to add knowledge on how different species use the thermal resources when they coexist in a habitat, studying the thermal physiology of three sympatric and syntopic liolaemid lizards, Phymaturus querque, Phymaturus zapalensis, and Liolaemus elongatus during the summer season. We measured the body temperatures at capture places, the operative microenvironmental temperatures in the field, and the preferred body temperature in an experimental thermal gradient in the laboratory. We found that the three species are thermoregulators, selecting cooler thermal microenvironments than the ones expected by chance, and even cooler than the temperatures they selected in a laboratory environment. Liolaemus elongatus is a more efficient thermoregulator (E = 0.671) than the two Phymaturus species, P. querque (E = 0.441) and P. zapalensis (E = 0.471), which are moderate thermoregulators and, apparently, specialists in finding specific types of shelters, since they seem to select certain types of rock crevices. Herein, we found that during the summer season, although individuals have access to warm microenvironments, they spend time on cool refuges, probably to prevent overheating.

Wolf spiders’ maternal behaviour is complex and involves guarding a cocoon for several weeks, and so cocoons must emit cues to ensure their care and the development of juveniles. We investigated cues associated with the cocoon silk. We assessed qualitative changes of the lipid contents and the composition of cocoon silk in relation to the development of P. saltans wolf spider juveniles. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of P. saltans’ cocoon silk revealed 62 different lipid compounds. The compounds were aliphatic alcohols, glycerides, fatty acids and their methylesters containing 13–29 carbon atoms. We reveal for the first time the presence of ethanolamides and phytosterol on cocoon silk. Qualitative and quantitative changes occur during the embryonic period, as some polar compounds, such as diglycerides and ethanolamides, disappeared while hydrocarbons emerge, and fatty acids disappeared later during the post-embryonic period. Qualitative and/or quantitative changes could play a role in tactochemical communication between mothers and their cocoon. However, mothers do not modify their behaviour in relation to the developmental stage of their cocoon. Mothers’ behaviour appears to be linked to both internal (physiological state) and external mechanisms (signals from the cocoon).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This feat has been attributed to their immersive feeding behavior that likely simultaneously provides benefits (nutrient rich) and potentially adverse (hypercapnia, hypoxia, high environmental ammonia) physiological effects. Examinations have been conducted of the ex vivo transport capabilities of specific nutrients as well as in vivo effects of the hypothesized feeding environments, yet the physiological effects of feeding itself have never been elucidated. We examined the post-prandial physiology of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii), identifying changes in oxygen consumption, acid–base balance, ammonia waste excretion, and intestinal morphology following feeding in captivity. Following voluntary feeding, post-prandial oxygen consumption was significantly elevated (1868 ± 272 µmol kg−1 h−1) 8 h following feeding when compared to control resting metabolic oxygen consumption (642 ± 51 µmol kg−1 h−1) and resulted in a factorial metabolic scope of 2.92. Changes in acid–base status were not observed following feeding in either the excreted components or the caudal blood samples; however, a significant alkalosis was observed 8 h post-feeding in the major intestinal blood vein. Significant increases (16-fold) in ammonia excretion were recorded in 36 h post-fed hagfish. Finally, significant post-prandial increases in intestinal mucosal thickness and microvilli length were observed, with mucosal thickness remaining significantly increased throughout 36 h and the microvilli length returning to fasted lengths by 36 h.

In the lamprey, a model organism for vertebrate locomotion, such sensory inputs come from intraspinal mechanosensory cells called “edge cells”. These edge cells synapse directly onto interneurons in the spinal central pattern generator (CPG) circuit and allow the CPG to adjust the motor output according to how the body is bending. However, the encoding properties of the edge cells have never been fully characterized. To identify these properties and better understand edge cells’ role in locomotion, we isolated spinal cords of silver lampreys (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis) and recorded extracellularly from the lateral tracts where edge cell axons are located. We identified cells that responded to mechanical stimuli and used standard spike sorting algorithms to identify separate units, then examined how the cells respond to bending rate and bending angle. Although some cells respond to the bending angle, as was previously known, the strongest and most common responses were to bending velocity.

In pythons, histamine induces a strong tachycardia and dilates the systemic vasculature, which resembles the cardiovascular response to the elevated metabolic rate during digestion. In fact, there is an important role of increased histaminergic tone on the heart during the initial 24 h of digestion in pythons. Whilst the cardiovascular effects of histamine are well studied in pythons, little is known about the effects in other groups of reptiles. The histaminergic effects on the heart vary among species and histamine may exert either pressor and depressor effects by causing either constrictive or dilatory vascular responses. Here, we investigated the cardiovascular effects of histamine in three species of reptiles with very different cardiovascular and pulmonary morphologies. Experiments were performed on both anesthetized and recovered animals. We show a species-dependent effect of histamine on the systemic vasculature with dilation in rattlesnakes and constriction in turtles and caimans but no effect on the pulmonary circulation. The histamine-induced dilation in rattlesnakes was mediated through an activation of H2-receptors, whereas the histamine-induced constriction in caimans was mediated through both adrenergic signaling and H1-receptors activation.

Second, it is intended to apply these new tools as eco-physiological indicators for understanding the impact of cuttlefish eggs’ life history from different spawning sites of the English Channel on digestive performance of juveniles. An experimental rearing was performed over 35 days after hatching (DAH) on juveniles from wild collected eggs in 2010 and 2011. Four digestive enzyme activities and their ratios [i.e., trypsin, cathepsin, acid (ACP), and alkaline (ALP) phosphatase, ALP/ACP, and trypsin/cathepsin] were studied along with histological features (e.g., internal yolk surface and digestive gland development). The two enzyme ratios were good indicators of digestive system maturation allowing the study of the digestive gland’s development. They were highly correlated to juveniles’ weight increase and histological features of the gland in early DAH. These ratios described more accurately the shift occurring between the intracellular acid and the extracellular alkaline modes of digestion in S. officinalis and were more specific than separated enzyme activities. Their application as eco-physiological tools revealed that enzyme ratios reflected yolk content and digestive gland development in new hatching juveniles.

Schistosomiasis is a chronic disease that affects over 260 million people globally, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. One strategy that has been proposed as a way to prevent human infection by the parasite, involves the use of pheromone traps to lure the snail host away from areas of human activity.

Here, we review its physiological adaptations to wintering, with an emphasis on northern Europe, where the raccoon dog spends the coldest part of the year in winter sleep. The timing of physiological changes related to wintering is connected to photoperiod by melatonin. In preparation to winter, raccoon dogs display autumnal hyperphagia and fattening probably regulated by the interaction of several peptide hormones. Sufficient fat deposition is essential for survival through the cold season and for reproduction in spring. The wintering strategy includes alternating periods of physical activity and passivity. Effective arousal and foraging during warmer bouts are enabled by normoglycaemia. During active periods, raccoon dogs are opportunistic participants in the food web, and they mainly utilize ungulate carcasses, plant material, and small mammals. Preferred wintertime habitats include watersides, forests, wetlands, and gardens. However, many food items become limited in mid-winter and snow restricts foraging leading to a negative energy balance. During passivity, energy is preserved by denning and by modest metabolic suppression, probably enabled by decreased thyroid hormone levels. Sleepiness and satiety could be maintained by high growth hormone and leptin concentrations. Several hormones participate in the extension of phase II of fasting with selective fatty acid mobilization and efficient protein conservation. The blood count, organ function tests, bone mass, and bone biomechanical properties exhibit high resistance against catabolism, and breeding can be successful after significant weight loss.

In this study, the effects of l-arginine-enriched diets on selected physiological responses and metabolic processes were assessed in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary l-arginine at concentrations 5–20 mM accelerated larval development and increased body mass, and total protein concentrations in third instar larvae, but did not affect these parameters when diets contained 100 mM arginine. Young (2 days old) adult flies of both sexes reared on food supplemented with 20 and 100 mM l-arginine possessed higher total protein concentrations and lower glucose and triacylglycerol concentrations than controls. Additionally, flies fed 20 mM l-arginine had higher proline and uric acid concentrations. l-Arginine concentration in the diet also affected oxidative stress intensity in adult flies. Food with 20 mM l-arginine promoted lower protein thiol concentrations and higher catalase activity in flies of both sexes and higher concentrations of low molecular mass thiols in males. When flies were fed on a diet with 100 mM l-arginine, lower catalase activities and concentrations of protein thiols were found in both sexes as well as lower low molecular mass thiols in females. l-Arginine-fed males demonstrated higher climbing activity, whereas females showed higher cold tolerance and lower fecundity, compared with controls. Food containing 20 mM l-arginine shortened life span in both males and females. The results suggest that dietary l-arginine shows certain beneficial effects at the larval stage and in young adults.

They are also able to use compass mechanisms for finding their ways and, not the least, to cope with the remarkable physiological requirements allowing them to fly non-stop for many hours. Similarly fascinating are the capabilities of the very long-distance migrants to navigate home or to a previous wintering site with the extraordinary precision of a few meters after having covered a distance of 10,000 km or more.

In larger bird species, these devices can also record inflight behaviour and physiology, thus making entirely novel insights in migration biology possible. In addition, recent developments of new techniques in other fields such as neurobiology, molecular biology, biochemistry and genomics together with the availability of data banks open up new opportunities to use different data from various sources in combination, to analyse new points of view and thereby to promote the rapid deepening of our understanding of the various aspects of bird migration. Yet, despite the increasing knowledge gathered over the last few decades, we still lack a coherent understanding of bird migration. The present Special Issue is to provide When Friedrich Barth, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A, invited us to become the guest editors of a Special Issue entitled “Bird Migration”, we immediately accepted his offer. The migration of birds is a really fascinating subject. No other group of terrestrial animals is as mobile as the birds are. Their ability to fly enables them to move around in large home ranges, and this might have predisposed them to undertake their extended migratory journeys. The annual migration of globally billions of birds is one of the most spectacular phenomena observed in nature. Migrations between breeding and non-breeding sites range from a few hundred kilometres in short-distance migrants such as goldfinches and siskins to impressive tens of thousands of kilometres each year in long-distance migrants. Examples of such long-distance migrants are the bar-tailed godwit, which travels from Alaska to New Zealand, the tiny northern wheatear going 15,000 km from Alaska across Asia into eastern Africa and the Arctic tern, which travels from its breeding grounds in the Arctic all the way to its sub-Antarctic wintering grounds. The majority of migratory species, namely songbirds and shorebirds, migrate at night, alone, and without the guidance by parents or other experienced individuals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

While the morphology of the heart in Drosophila and mammals is different, many of the molecular mechanisms that underlie heart development and function are similar and function can be assessed by similar physiological measurements, such as cardiac output, rate, and time in systole or diastole. Here, we have utilized an intact, optogenetic approach to assess the neural influence on heart rate in the third instar larvae. To simulate the release of modulators from the nervous system in response to environmental influences, we have directed expression of channel-rhodopsin variants to targeted neuronal populations to assess the role of these neural ensembles in directing release of modulators that may affect heart rate in vivo. Our observations show that the activation of targeted neurons, including cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurons, stimulate the release of cardioactive substances that increase heart rate after the initial activation at both room temperature and in a cold environment. This parallels previous studies suggesting these modulators play a crucial role in altering heart rate when applied to exposed hearts and adds to our understanding of chemical modulation of heart rate in intact Drosophila larvae.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

For terrestrial animals, 1 Hz GPS-position, 3D-body acceleration, and ambient temperature provide standard data to link to the physiology of life histories. Environmental context is added at ever finer scales using remote sensing earth observation data. Here we showcase the use of such bio-logging approaches in a conservation physiology study on endangered Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis). We determine environmental, behavioural, and physiological causes of survival in immature birds that roam from wintering sites in India, Bhutan, and Nepal towards summer areas in Tibet and Mongolia. Five of 18 immature griffons died during one year. Individuals that died had failed to migrate sufficiently far northward (>1500 km) in spring. Individuals likely died if they flew against headwinds from the north or were less able to find thermal updrafts. Surviving individuals migrated to cold and dry areas with low population density. We highlight flight experience, long distance movements, and remote places with low human population as factors critical for the survival of Himalayan vultures.

Here, we first discuss behavioral tests using radio-frequency magnetic fields (0.1–10 MHz) to specifically disturb a radical-pair-based avian magnetic compass sense. While disorienting effects of broadband RF magnetic fields have been replicated independently in two competing labs, the effects of monochromatic RF magnetic fields administered at the electronic Larmor frequency (~1.3 MHz) are disparate. We give technical recommendations for future RF experiments. We then focus on two candidate magnetoreceptor proteins in birds, Cry1a and Cry1b, two splice variants of the same gene (Cry1). Immunohistochemical studies have identified Cry1a in the outer segments of the ultraviolet/violet-sensitive cone photoreceptors and Cry1b in the cytosol of retinal ganglion cells. The identification of the host neurons of these cryptochromes and their subcellular expression patterns presents an important advance, but much work lies ahead to gain some functional understanding. In particular, interaction partners of cryptochrome Cry1a and Cry1b remain to be identified.

It involves predictable seasonal movements between breeding and non-breeding habitats. Both circadian and circannual clocks are entrained by photoperiodic cues and time daily and seasonal changes in migratory physiology and behavior. This mini-review provides an update on daily and seasonal rhythms of migratory behavior, and examines the neuroendocrine and molecular pathways involved in the timing of migration in songbirds. Recent findings have identified key neural substrates, and suggest the involvement of multiple neuroendocrine regulatory systems in controlling seasonal states in migrants. We propose that four distinct neural substrates are involved in the timing of migration and include (1) pineal gland and suprachiasmatic nucleus (mSCN); (2) a cluster of hypothalamic nuclei, the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH); (3) dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH); and (4) tanycytes along ependymal layer of the 3rd ventricle (3V). Cluster N, a nucleus in the telencephalon involved in the integration of geomagnetic cues, likely maintains functional connectivity with brain regions involved in timing songbird migration. These nuclei form an interconnected network that coordinates daily timing (pineal gland/mSCN), annual photoperiodic response (MBH, 3V), energetic state (MBH, DMH, 3V), and magnetic compass information (i.e., cluster N) for migration in songbirds.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Histone methylation is one mechanism that is known to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level. Here, we measured relative protein levels of seven histone methyltransferases (SMYD2, SETD7, ASH2L, RBBP5, SUV39H1, EHMT2, and SET8), four methylated histone H3 residues (H3K4me1, H3K9me3, H3K27me1, and H3K36me2), the methyltransferase activity on H3K4, and methylation of p53 (p53K370me2 and p53K372me1) in the skeletal muscle and liver of the freeze-tolerant wood frog (Rana sylvatica) during the freeze–thaw cycle. Overall, the results reveal a tissue-specific expression of histone methyltransferases and the methylation sites on histone H3 during freezing and thaw. In liver, H3K4me1 significantly decreased during freezing, H3K9me3 remained constant across conditions, H3K27me1 increased only during thaw, and H3K36me2 increased during freezing and then decreased during thaw (p < 0.05, n = 4). In skeletal muscle, H3K4me1 and H3K27me1 both decreased during freezing, whereas H3K9me3 and H3K36me2 were maintained across freezing and thaw (p < 0.05, n = 4). Methylation of p53 was also tissue-specific, where no changes were seen in liver tissue; however, p53 in skeletal muscle was differentially methylated. Overall, these results provide an evidence for the potential role methylation of histones and non-histone proteins play in freezing survival and entrance into a hypometabolic state.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The basic functional units are superficial and canal neuromasts, which are involved in hydrodynamic sensing and cohesion in schooling fish. Yellow-eyed mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri) are an obligate schooling species found commonly in shallow coastal areas of New Zealand and Australia. Schooling is a fundamental part of their behavioural repertoire, yet little is known about the structure or functionality of the lateral line in this species. We used scanning electron microscopy to characterise the morphology of trunk superficial neuromasts. We then took a multi-sensory approach and conducted behavioural experiments comparing school structure in groups of fish with and without fully functioning lateral lines, under photopic and scotopic conditions. A highly developed hydro-sensing system exists on the trunk of yellow-eyed mullet consisting of superficial neuromasts containing hundreds of hair cells aligned, with respect to their most sensitive axis, in a rostrocaudal direction. Without functioning superficial neuromasts, schooling behaviour was disrupted under both photopic and scotopic conditions and the ability to detect stationary objects decreased. Results highlight the importance of this component of the lateral line system to schooling behaviour.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Despite the rise of molecular techniques, the phylogenetic positions of tardigrades and onychophorans in the panarthropod tree (onychophorans + tardigrades + arthropods) remain unresolved. Hence, these methods alone are currently insufficient for clarifying the panarthropod topology. Therefore, the evolution of different morphological traits, such as one of the most intriguing features of panarthropods—their nervous system—becomes essential for shedding light on the origin and evolution of arthropods and their relatives within the Panarthropoda. In this review, we summarise current knowledge of the evolution of panarthropod nervous and visual systems. In particular, we focus on the evolution of segmental ganglia, the segmental identity of brain regions, and the visual system from morphological and developmental perspectives. In so doing, we address some of the many controversies surrounding these topics, such as the homology of the onychophoran eyes to those of arthropods as well as the segmentation of the tardigrade brain. Finally, we attempt to reconstruct the most likely state of these systems in the last common ancestors of arthropods and panarthropods based on what is currently known about tardigrades and onychophorans.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We analyzed mATPase activities in muscles of the front, middle and hind legs of the orthopteran stick insect (Carausius morosus) to test the hypothesis that differences in muscle fiber types and distributions reflected differences in their behavioral functions. Our data show that all muscles are composed of at least three fiber types, fast, intermediate and slow, and demonstrate that: (1) in the femoral muscles (extensor and flexor tibiae) of all legs, the number of fast fibers decreases from proximal to distal, with a concomitant increase in the number of slow fibers. (2) The swing phase muscles protractor coxae and levator trochanteris, have smaller percentages of slow fibers compared to the antagonist stance muscles retractor coxae and depressor trochanteris. (3) The percentage of slow fibers in the retractor coxae and depressor trochanteris increases significantly from front to hind legs. These results suggest that fiber-type distribution in leg muscles of insects is not identical across leg muscles but tuned towards the specific function of a given muscle in the locomotor system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To experimentally determine susceptibility differences between species, we exposed hibernating naïve little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to the fungus that causes WNS, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). After hibernating under identical conditions, Pd lesions were significantly more prevalent and more severe in little brown myotis. This species difference in pathology correlates with susceptibility to WNS in the wild and suggests that survival is related to different host physiological responses. We observed another fungal infection, associated with neutrophilic inflammation, that was equally present in all bats. This suggests that both species are capable of generating a response to cold tolerant fungi and that Pd may have evolved mechanisms for evading host responses that are effective in at least some bat species. These host–pathogen interactions are likely mediated not just by host physiological responses, but also by host behavior. Pd-exposed big brown bats, the less affected species, spent more time in torpor than did control animals, while little brown myotis did not exhibit this change. This differential thermoregulatory response to Pd infection by big brown bat hosts may allow for a more effective (or less pathological) immune response to tissue invasion.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To investigate if the genetic makeup of one or a set of these candidate genes can be used to identify a general pattern between migratory and non-migratory birds, we extracted genomic sequence data for 25 hypothesised candidate genes for migration from 70 available genomes across all orders of Aves and characterised sequence divergence between migratory and non-migratory phenotypes. When examining each gene separately across all species, we did not identify any genetic variants in candidate genes that distinguished migrants from non-migrants; any resulting pattern was driven by the phylogenetic signal. This was true for each gene analysed independently, but also for concatenated sequence alignments of all candidate genes combined. We also attempted to distinguish between migrant and non-migrants using structural features at four candidate genes that have previously been reported to show associated with migratory behaviour but did not pick up a signal for migratory phenotype here either. Finally, a screen for dN/dS ratio across all focal candidate genes to probe for putative features of selection did not uncover a pattern, though this might not be expected given the broad phylogenetic scale used here. Our study demonstrates the potential of public genomic data to test for general patterns of migratory gene candidates in a cross-species comparative context, and raise questions on the applicability of candidate gene approaches in a macro-evolutionary context to understand the genetic architecture of migratory behaviour.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Cold acclimation of fifth instar larvae of O. nubilalis during diapause had modest effects further on the readjustments in fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Overall, FA unsaturation (UFAs/SFAs ratio) was stable, with the exception of the triacylglycerols fraction after exposure to −3 and −10 °C in mid-diapause (MD) when it significantly increased. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine phase transitions of total body lipid of cold-acclimated larvae in diapause. Thermal analysis indicated that changes in the melt transition temperatures of whole body total lipids were subtle, but consistent with the modest changes in the level of FA unsaturation observed. We conclude that lipid rearrangements are a function of the endogenous “diapause program” rather than a direct effect of low temperatures, which proved to have limited impact on lipid changes in diapausing larvae of O. nubilalis.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, potentially opposing selective pressures might be present to ensure species recognition. Here, we analyzed the movement-based signals of two pairs of sympatric lizard species to consider how reliable communication is maintained while avoiding misidentification. Our novel approach allows us to quantify signal contrast with plant motion noise at any site we measure, including those utilized by other species. Ctenophorus caudicinctus and Gowidon longirostris differed in display complexity and motor pattern use. They also differed in overall morphology, but their signal contrast scores are strikingly similar. These results demonstrate similar adaptations to their shared environment while maintaining species recognition cues. In contrast, Ctenophorus fordi and Ctenophorus pictus are much closer in appearance, but C. pictus produces considerably higher signal contrast scores, which we suggest is attributable to the absence of territoriality in C. fordi. Taken together, our data provide evidence for adaptation to the local environment in movement-based signals, while also meeting species recognition requirements, but the selective pressure to deal with local conditions is mediated by signal function.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To gain insight into the physiological properties that support sound production in toothed whales, we examined myoglobin content ([Mb]), non-bicarbonate buffering capacity (β), fiber-type profiles, and myosin heavy chain expression of vocal musculature in two odontocetes: the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; n = 4) and the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena; n = 5). Both species use the same anatomical structures to produce sound, but differ markedly in their vocal repertoires.

Overall, vocal muscles had significantly lower [Mb] and β than locomotor muscles from the same species. The PPS was predominately composed of small diameter slow-twitch fibers. Fiber-type and myosin heavy chain analyses revealed that the GGC was comprised largely of fast-twitch fibers (Tursiops: 88.6%, Phocoena: 79.7%) and had the highest β of all vocal muscles. Notably, there was a significant difference in [Mb] between the RNM and LNM in Tursiops, but not Phocoena.

Numerous detrimental effects have been documented in marine fish, ranging from reduced mortality to neurosensory impairment, and the prevailing opinions state that these effects are largely the downstream consequences of altered blood carbon dioxide chemistry caused by respiratory acid–base disturbances. While the respiratory acid–base disturbances are consistent responses to OA across tested fish species, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is wide variability in the degree of downstream impairments between species. This can also be extended to intraspecies variability, whereby some individuals have tolerant physiological traits, while others succumb to the effects of OA. This review will synthesize relevant literature on marine fish to highlight consistent trends of impairment, as well as observed interspecies variability in the responses to OA, and the potential routes of physiological acclimation. In all cases, whole animal responses are linked to demonstrated or proposed physiological impairments. Major topics of focus include: (1) respiratory acid–base disturbances; (2) early life survival and growth; (3) the implications for metabolic performance, activity, and reproduction; and (4) emerging physiological theories pertaining to neurosensory impairment and the role of GABAA receptors.

Taurine is an important osmolyte in teleost hearts, but its role in stress tolerance, cardiac metabolism, and contractility has not been assessed. The goal of this study was to determine if ventricular taurine concentration changes in response to environmental stress and to characterize its influence on contractility. Cardiac taurine concentrations varied in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) but were generally maintained following acute environmental challenges. In isometrically contracting ventricular strips, supplemental taurine (40 mmol L−1) protected peak tension development (Fmax) at high stimulation frequencies, an effect abolished by treatment with ryanodine, a blocker of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. In the presence of ryanodine, taurine-treated preparations were also better able to maintain Fmax at supraphysiological extracellular Ca2+ levels, but a prior anoxia exposure abolished this effect. Taurine had no impact on basal Fmax during or after anoxia, but it provided additive protection to high-frequency contractility post-anoxia. Tissue oxygen consumption and extracellular glucose utilization were unaffected by taurine in non-contracting preparations, indicating that it does not impact energy metabolism. Overall, the results suggest that cardiac taurine levels are well maintained on acute time scales in this highly stress-tolerant species. Supplemental taurine has no effect on aerobic metabolism in vitro, but it significantly improved cardiac contractility in a manner dependent upon sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ cycling.

Mild hypoxia only caused a reduction in blood pO2 and oxygen saturation. Both acute and chronic moderate and extreme hypoxia caused a decrease in blood pH, pO2, total oxygen content, plasma Na+, and Cl− at all time points. Acute moderate and extreme hypoxia resulted in an increase in blood pCO2, plasma glucose, lactate, and hematocrit. Chronic exposure to moderate hypoxia resulted in an increase in plasma lactate, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin.

Bird migration has fascinated humans for centuries and routes crossing the globe are now starting to be revealed by advanced tracking technology. A central question is what compass mechanism, celestial or geomagnetic, is activated during these long flights. Different approaches based on the geometry of flight routes across the globe and route simulations based on predictions from compass mechanisms with or without including the effect of winds have been used to try to answer this question with varying results. A major focus has been use of orthodromic (great circle) and loxodromic (rhumbline) routes using celestial information, while geomagnetic information has been proposed for both a magnetic loxodromic route and a magnetoclinic route. Here, we review previous results and evaluate if one or several alternative compass mechanisms can explain migration routes in birds. We found that most cases could be explained by magnetoclinic routes (up to 73% of the cases), while the sun compas
s could explain only 50%. Both magnetic and geographic loxodromes could explain <25% of the routes. The magnetoclinic route functioned across latitudes (1°S–74°N), while the sun compass only worked in the high Arctic (61–69°N). We discuss the results with respect to orientation challenges and availability of orientation cues.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These features could be explained by a voltage-gated Ca2+ current acting in concert with a Ca2+-activated nonspecific current (ICAN). In vertebrates, ICAN is associated with TRPM4 channels which are blocked selectively by 9-phenanthrol. Here, we show that 9-phenanthrol selectively inhibits a late phase of PIR and simultaneously enhances afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs). Bath application of NNC 55-0396 or Cd2+ combined with ion substitution experiments indicate that a low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current plays a key role in generating PIR and that Ca2+ influx through low- or high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels can trigger AHPs via activation of a Ca2+-dependent K+ current. We also demonstrate modulation of rebound responses by other ICAN blockers such as gadolinium and flufenamic acid, as well as the calmodulin antagonist W-7. We discuss how these results provide additional insights into the specific types of ionic currents underlying rebound responses of motor neuron DE-3 in the medicinal leech.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This butterfly has a facultative adult diapause controlled by the corpora allata and brain. Methoprene seems to terminate reproductive diapause, although transplantation experiments indicate that the activity of the corpora allata does not affect male mating behavior Endo (Dev Growth Differ 15:1–10, 1973a), suggesting that the brain may be involved in diapause. We found that exposure to methoprene promoted the development of ovaries and of the male accessory glands and simplex. On the other hand, exposure to 20-hydroxyecdysone did not promote the development of female and male reproductive organs and eupyrene sperm movement from the testis to the duplex in the adult stage. Ecdysteroid titer in both sexes was consistently low in adults. These results suggest that imaginal diapause is largely regulated by juvenile hormone in this butterfly.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

N. viridula is a serious crop pest in the world and shows attachment devices different from the so far investigated Heteroptera, with a tarsus characterized by distal smooth flexible pulvilli combined with claws and proximal ventral hairy pad. Notwithstanding the different body mass between the sexes, no difference was found between friction forces generated by females and males. Friction force was higher on hydrophilic surfaces than on hydrophobic ones and was lower on both sides of V. faba leaf compared with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic artificial smooth surfaces. On the surfaces with different roughness, the friction force values varied significantly, with the higher attachment ability on the surface with very high asperity size followed by the smooth surface. The lowest attachment was on the surfaces with intermediate asperity sizes. These results could be related to the specific combination of attachment devices of N. viridula.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

On the Australian continent, backgrounds are very diverse and include surface examples of all major geological stages of the Earth’s history, which have been present during the entire evolutionary period of Angiosperms. Flower signals in Australia are also representative of typical worldwide evolutionary spectral adaptations that enable successful pollination. We measured the spectral properties of 581 natural surfaces, including rocks, sand, green leaves, and dry plant materials, sampled from tropical Cairns through to the southern tip of mainland Australia. We modelled in a hexagon colour space, how interactions between background spectra and flower-like colour stimuli affect reliable discrimination and detection in bee pollinators. We calculated the extent to which a given locus would be conflated with the loci of a different flower-colour stimulus using empirically determined colour discrimination regions for bee vision. Our results reveal that whilst colour signals are robust in homogeneous background viewing conditions, there could be significant pressure on plant flowers to evolve saliently-different colours to overcome background spectral noise. We thus show that perceptual noise has a large influence on how colour information can be used in natural conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Specifically, foragers can use the skyline where terrestrial landmarks meet the sky. Foraging ants show a remarkable affinity to retain these terrestrial cues, developing lifelong memories of the nest site panorama. Here we explore foragers’ ability to retain skyline cues of resource locations at some distance from the nest through experiments with artificial skylines erected around a resource location. We also tested the foragers’ memories of one skyline at several time points after the skyline was replaced by a different one. During retention testing, foragers appear able to retain robust memories of these skylines over periods (5 days) that surpass their average life span. Exposure to the nest panorama during these periods did not interfere with navigational performance at the distant skyline. Foragers in the replacement experiment initially oriented correctly to both skylines. Thereafter, the foragers’ headings in tests with the first skyline gradually shifted away from the correct homeward direction. We argue that new skyline memories cause retroactive interference in the retention of previously learned skylines.

Previous work has indicated that the gland may be activated by a number of hormones, some of which are likely related to the salt or volume loads associated with feeding. Furthermore, evidence exists for the gland being glucose dependent which is atypical for an elasmobranch tissue. In this study, the presence of sodium–glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) in the rectal gland and their regulation by feeding were investigated. In addition, the hypothesis of glucose dependence was examined through the use of glucose transporter (GLUT and SGLT) inhibitors, phlorizin, Indinavir, and STF-31 and their effect on secretion by the rectal gland. Finally, the effects on rectal gland activity of insulin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide-1, hormones typically involved in glucoregulation, were examined. The results showed that sglt1 mRNA is present in the gland, and there was a significant reduction in sglt1 transcript abundance 24 h post-feeding. An almost complete suppression of chloride secretion was observed when glucose uptake was inhibited, confirming the organ’s glucose dependence. Finally, perfusion with dogfish GLP-1 (10 nmol L−1), but not dogfish glucagon, was shown to markedly stimulate the activity of the gland, increasing chloride secretion rates above baseline by approximately 16-fold (p < 0.001). As GLP-1 is released from the intestine upon feeding, we propose that this may be the primary signal for activation of the rectal gland post-feeding.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To investigate how interactions between stressors influence thermal tolerance in the common forest ant, Aphaenogaster picea, we compared the thermal resistance of workers to heat shock with and without pre-exposure to desiccation or starvation stress. Knockdown (KD) time at 40.5 °C of desiccated ants was reduced 6% compared to controls, although longer exposure to desiccation did not further reduce thermal tolerance. Starvation, in contrast, had an increasingly severe effect on thermal tolerance: at 21 days, average KD time of starved ants was reduced by 65% compared to controls. To test whether reduction in thermal tolerance results from impairment of the heat-shock response, we measured basal gene expression and transcriptional induction of two heat-shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp40) in treated and control ants. We found no evidence that either stressor impaired the Hsp response: both desiccation and starvation slightly increased basal Hsp expression under severe stress conditions and did not affect the magnitude of induction under heat shock. These results suggest that the co-occurrence of multiple environmental stressors predicted by climate change models may make populations more vulnerable to future warming than is suggested by the results of single-factor heating experiments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, torpor has many other functions that ultimately increase the survival of heterothermic mammals and birds. In this review, we summarize new findings revealing that animals use torpor to cope with the conditions during and after natural disasters, including fires, storms, and heat waves. Furthermore, we suggest that torpor, which also prolongs longevity and was likely crucial for survival of mammals during the time of the dinosaur extinctions, will be advantageous in a changing world. Climate change is assumed to lead to an increase in the occurrence and intensity of climatic disasters, such as those listed above and also abnormal floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures. The opportunistic use of torpor, found in many heterothermic species, will likely enhance survival of these challenges, because these species can reduce energy and foraging requirements. However, many strictly seasonal hibernators will likely face the negative consequences of the predicted increase in temperature, such as range contraction. Overall, available data suggest that opportunistic heterotherms with their flexible energy requirements have an adaptive advantage over homeotherms in response to unpredictable conditions.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris L.) were trained to fly along tunnels of different widths, from 60 to 240 cm. In tunnel widths of 60 and 120 cm, bumblebees control their lateral position by balancing the magnitude of translational optic flow experienced in the lateral visual field of each eye. In wider tunnels, bumblebees use translational optic flow cues in the ventral visual field to control their lateral position and to steer along straight tracks. Our results also suggest that bumblebees prefer to fly over surfaces that provide strong ventral optic flow cues, rather than over featureless ones. Together, these strategies allow bumblebees to minimize the risk of collision and to maintain relatively straight flight paths in a broad range of environments.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Extended fasting is associated with increased β-oxidation of fatty acids and reduced oxidation of glucose to minimize commitment of body protein to gluconeogenesis. However, the metabolic strategies used to sustain extended fasts simultaneous with high rates of energy expenditure are not well understood. Studies in fasting adult female and weanling northern elephant seals (NES) have revealed high rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) under constraints of high nutrient demand for lactation or development but relatively low rates of metabolism. These studies revealed low rates of glucose oxidation and high rates of glucose recycling through the Cori cycle. We measured rates of glucose flux in fasting adult male NES to assess how significantly longer fasting durations, higher metabolic rates, and greater rates of muscular activity affect glucose kinetics. We measured glucose turnover in 18 adult males using the clearance of [6-H3] glucose during breeding and molting. Adult male NES maintain high rates of EGP across extended fasts. EGP greatly exceeded estimated needs for glucose-dependent tissues, varied directly with plasma insulin and lactate concentrations, and was inversely related to plasma ketoacid concentrations. Together, these findings suggest that high rates of glucose production and recycling during breeding maintain high blood glucose levels to support glucose-dependent tissues while minimizing production of ketoacids and commitment of protein stores to glucose production.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The greater diversity of bats and echolocation strategies in the Neotropics compared with temperate zones would be expected to impose different sensory requirements on the neotropical moths. However, even given some variability among moth assemblages, the frequencies of best hearing of moths from different climate zones studied to date have been roughly the same: between 20 and 60 kHz. We have analyzed the auditory characteristics of tympanate moths from Cuba, a neotropical island with high levels of bat diversity and a high incidence of echolocation frequencies above those commonly at the upper limit of moths’ hearing sensitivity. Moths of the superfamilies Noctuoidea, Geometroidea and Pyraloidea were examined. Audiograms were determined by non-invasively measuring distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. We also quantified the frequency spectrum of the echolocation sounds to which this moth community is exposed. The hearing ranges of moths in our study showed best frequencies between 36 and 94 kHz. High sensitivity to frequencies above 50 kHz suggests that the auditory sensitivity of moths is suited to the sounds used by sympatric echolocating bat fauna.

Nevertheless, the various benefits of hibernation might be counteracted by negative effects of torpor such as immune depression, oxidative stress, or neuronal impairment. Considering these trade-offs, adequate energy reserves could allow animals to reduce the time spent in torpor or the extent of metabolic depression. Common hamsters use food stores during hibernation and previously documented high individual variations in body temperature patterns during winter could, therefore, be related to differences in external energy reserves. In this study, we manipulated the availability of food stores under laboratory conditions to investigate potential effects on hibernation patterns. Female hamsters were kept in artificial burrows in climate chambers and subcutaneous temperature was recorded using implanted data loggers. One group had access to large food stores, whereas another group received daily food portions which were removed on the next day if not consumed. Almost all hamsters without access to food stores hibernated, while less than half of the individuals with food stores entered deep torpor. Individuals without food hoards additionally expressed more short torpor bouts and exhibited lower minimum subcutaneous temperatures during torpor than those with food stores. Thus, individuals confronted with lacking food reserves were more likely to hibernate and additionally saved energy by entering short torpor bouts more frequently and remaining at lower subcutaneous temperature both during torpor and euthermic periods. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that food store availability affects torpor expression and also highlight variation in torpor patterns and energy-saving strategies in common hamsters.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Because many animals are exposed to considerable thermal variation in winter, they may benefit from a quick enhancement of cold tolerance prior to extreme low temperature. Hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) overwintering in their natal nests experience substantial thermal variation in winter, and recently, it was found that brief subzero chilling of winter-acclimated hatchlings decreases subsequent chilling-induced mortality, increases blood concentrations of glucose and lactate, and protects the brain from cryoinjury. Here, we further characterize that phenomenon, termed ‘cold conditioning’, by exposing winter-acclimated hatchling turtles to −3.5, −7.0, or −10.5 °C gradually or repeatedly via daily thermal fluctuations over the course of 5 days and assessing their survival of a subsequent cold shock to a discriminating temperature of −12.7 °C. To better understand the physiological response to cold conditioning, we measured changes in glucose and lactate concentrations in the liver, blood, and brain. Cold conditioning significantly increased cold-shock survival, from 9% in reference turtles up to 74% in cold-conditioned turtles, and ecologically relevant daily thermal fluctuations were at least as effective at conferring cryoprotection as was gradual cold conditioning. Cold conditioning increased glucose concentrations, up to 25 μmol g−1, and lactate concentrations, up to 30 μmol g−1, in the liver, blood, and brain. Turtles that were cold conditioned with daily thermal fluctuations accumulated more glucose in the liver, blood, and brain, and had lower brain lactate, than those gradually cold conditioned. Given the thermal variation to which hatchling painted turtles are exposed in winter, we suggest that the supplemental protection conferred by cold conditioning, especially that induced by daily thermal fluctuations, may be important for their overwinter survival. Investigation into the duration of the cold-conditioning induced protection and its occurrence in natural field conditions is needed to better understand its ecological significance. We suggest that future work exploring the underlying mechanisms of cold conditioning should focus on non-colligative effects of glucose, expression of small Hsps, changes in membrane structure, and ion homeostasis.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This has been documented for sensory neurons of the visual, olfactory, electrosensory, and auditory system both in response to constant-amplitude and to sinusoidal stimuli, but has thus far not been described systematically for the lateral line system. We recorded neuronal activity from primary afferent nerve fibres in the lateral line in goldfish in response to sinusoidal wave stimuli. Depending on stimulus characteristics, afferent fibre responses exhibited a distinct onset followed by a decline in firing rate to an apparent steady-state level, i.e., they exhibited adaptation. The degree of adaptation, measured as the percent decrease in firing rate between onset and steady-state, increased with stimulus amplitude and frequency and with increasing steepness of the rising flank of the stimulus. This may in part be due to the velocity and/or acceleration sensitivity of the lateral line receptors. The time course of the response decline, i.e., the time course of adaptation was best-fit by a power function. This is consistent with the previous studies on spike frequency adaptation in sensory afferents of weakly electric fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We measured changes in the standard metabolic rates of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana Baird and Girard, 1852) in response to different immune challenges and nutritional states. In the first experiment, lizards were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (to stimulate the response to a pathogen), cutaneous biopsy (as a proxy to a superficial wound), both injection and biopsy, or neither (control). Four and five days later, we measured the standard metabolic rates of the lizards. In response to healing a cutaneous wound, lizards reduced metabolic rate and lost body mass. Healing rate was also inversely related to weight loss, but LPS had no effect on body mass or metabolic rate. In the second experiment, a new set of lizards were randomly assigned to a high-food or low-food diet and administered a cutaneous biopsy. As in the first experiment, we observed a reduction in metabolic rate after wounding; moreover, this decrease was positively correlated with the rate of healing. We observed higher rates of metabolism in lizards that ate more food, but food consumption was unrelated to the decrease in metabolic rate following the biopsy.

One-third of analysed hagfish were shown to accumulate radiolabelled drinking rate markers (tritiated inulin and polyethylene glycol-4000) in their gut tissues; however, this was attributed to the presence of markers in the blood perfusing the digestive tract, following absorption through paracellular pathways at the gill. No accumulation of marker was observed in hagfish subjected to more dilute (75% seawater) or more concentrated (125% seawater) media.

An adaptive energetic framework for interpreting basal metabolic rate variation in endotherms,"Adaptive explanations for both high and low body mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR) in endotherms are pervasive in evolutionary physiology, but arguments implying a direct adaptive benefit of high BMR are troublesome from an energetic standpoint. Here, we argue that conclusions about the adaptive benefit of BMR need to be interpreted, first and foremost, in terms of energetics, with particular attention to physiological traits on which natural selection is directly acting. We further argue from an energetic perspective that selection should always act to reduce BMR (i.e., maintenance costs) to the lowest level possible under prevailing environmental or ecological demands, so that high BMR per se is not directly adaptive. We emphasize the argument that high BMR arises as a correlated response to direct selection on other physiological traits associated with high ecological or environmental costs, such as daily energy expenditure (DEE) or capacities for activity or thermogenesis. High BMR thus represents elevated maintenance costs required to support energetically demanding lifestyles, including living in harsh environments. BMR is generally low under conditions of relaxed selection on energy demands for high metabolic capacities (e.g., thermoregulation, activity) or conditions promoting energy conservation. Under these conditions, we argue that selection can act directly to reduce BMR. We contend that, as a general rule, BMR should always be as low as environmental or ecological conditions permit, allowing energy to be allocated for other functions. Studies addressing relative reaction norms and response times to fluctuating environmental or ecological demands for BMR, DEE, and metabolic capacities and the fitness consequences of variation in BMR and other metabolic traits are needed to better delineate organismal metabolic responses to environmental or ecological selective forces.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The first meeting was held May 13–15, 1959 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Endicott House (see Table 1). The 26 presented papers in that first meeting focused greatly on the physiology of hibernation and has set the tone for the ensuing meetings. One of the highlights of the meeting and subsequent symposium volume were the candid discussions (Lyman and Dawe 1960). Members of the hibernation community shared insight after each presentation and discussed the future directions of the field. Some of this discussion is seemingly humorous in retrospective. In a discussion as to the ‘validity of the term, hibernation’, one participant debated the meaning of ‘validity’—perhaps highlighting the historical difficulty, the field has had with nomenclature that suitably describes the extraordinary diversity of torpor use. The community was trying to separate out hypothermia from hibernation—a problem that we grappled with even in the 2016 meeting. Indeed, many of the topics pursued in the first meeting are still relevant 58 years later. We know much more than we did then, but we still struggle with the basic questions as to why do animals hibernate or why do almost all hibernators experience periodic euthermic arousals during the winter. Every 3–6 years, meetings were held. Proceedings were published a year or two after the meeting. The impact of these meetings was tremendous even early on. As far as we can tell, the first suggestion that brown adipose tissue was thermogenic came from Robert E. Smith in the 2nd symposium in 1962. Smith discussed how no satisfactory physiological role had yet been assigned to brown adipose tissue and then presented data that supported a role for thermogenesis and homeothermy. The ideas presented at the meeting in 1962 led to the landmark paper in Science demonstrating the role of brown adipose tissue in thermogenesis This special issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology B is dedicated to papers arising from the 15th International Hibernation Symposium held in Las Vegas, NV, USA from July 31–August 4th, 2016. These symposia occur every 4 years and bring together virtually all of the world’s experts on mammalian hibernation. The 2016 program was primarily focused on mammalian hibernation with presentations on topics such as the evolution or plasticity of torpor use, how hibernation impacts on physiological systems such as the immune system, muscles, or bones, the molecular underpinnings of hibernation, and biomedical implications and prospects from hibernation. Mammals such as ground squirrels, bats, tenrecs, bears, echidnas, dormice, and lemurs were discussed. However, there was also discussion about birds, fish, lizards, and snakes and even gut microbial communities. Approaches towards solving problems spanned from ecological to physiological to biochemical and molecular strategies. Importantly, the program extended beyond hibernation and included the basic science of thermoregulation, hypoxia tolerance, brown adipose tissue function, and cold adaptation. Perhaps, most extraordinary about these meetings is the lack of formal rules or programming guidelines. The meeting was organized based on contributions and truly reflects the diversity of evolving research paradigms. Posters were encouraged to reflect the latest projects and allowed for insightful discussion.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This role of hippocampal neurons during torpor is based in part on in vivo studies showing that histamine (HA) infused into ground squirrel hippocampi lengthened torpor bouts by ~50%. However, it was unclear if HA acted directly on hippocampal neurons or on downstream brain regions via HA spillover into lateral ventricles. To clarify this, we used hippocampal slices to determine if HA would modulate pyramidal neurons at low levels of synaptic activity (as occurs in torpor). We tested the hypotheses that although LTP (a neuroplasticity mechanism) could not be generated at low temperatures, HA (via H2 receptors) would increase population spike amplitudes (PSAs) of Syrian hamster CA1 pyramidal neurons at low stimulation voltages and low temperatures. PSAs were recorded following Schaffer collateral stimulation from subthreshold levels to a maximum response plateau. We found that tetanus evoked LTP at 35 °C but not 15 °C; and at temperatures from 30 to 15 °C, HA significantly enhanced PSA at near threshold levels in slices from non-hibernating hamsters housed in “summer-like” or “winter-like” conditions and from hibernating hamsters. Cimetidine (H2 antagonist) blocked HA-mediated PSA increases in 8 of 8 slices; pyrilamine (H1 antagonist) had no effect in 7 of 8 slices. These results support our hypotheses and show that HA can directly enhance pyramidal neuron excitability via H2 receptors and thus may prolong torpor bouts.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Heat stress affected energy metabolism and oxidative stress parameters in a time-, tissue-, and species-dependent manner, and gills were more sensitive than kidneys to heat stress. N. rossii kidneys were able to stabilize carbohydrate metabolism after 12 h of heat stress, whereas the glycogen levels in N. coriiceps kidneys fluctuated in response to varying glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) levels. The gills of N. rossii were able to stabilize their energy demand and aerobic metabolism under heat stress, whereas in the gills of N. coriiceps, changes in carbohydrate metabolic pathways depended on the exposure time: initially, anaerobiosis was activated after 6 h; the energy demand, characterized by glycogen consumption, increased after 72 h, and aerobic metabolism was activated within 144 h. With regard to the antioxidant defenses of the N. rossii kidney, it was found that levels of antioxidant enzymes were reduced during the first hours of heat stress, contributing to increased lipid peroxidation, whereas N. coriiceps kidneys did not show signs of oxidative damage. The gills of N. rossii exhibited more pronounced oxidative damage in response to heat stress than those of N. coriiceps despite the presence of increasing levels of antioxidants, likely due to tissue hypoxia.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Phenotypes associated with increased protection against or reduced damage from harmful environments may, in fact, be downstream effects of hidden adaptive responses that remain elusive to experimental measurement or be obscured by homeostatic or over-compensatory effects. The freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia drastically increases its heat tolerance as the result of acclimation to high temperatures, an effect often assumed to be based on plastic responses allowing better protection against oxidative stress. Using several geographically distant Daphnia magna genotypes, we demonstrate that the more heat tolerant individuals have a higher total antioxidant capacity (TAC) both in the comparison of heat-acclimated vs. non heat-acclimated females and in the comparison of females to age- and body size-matched males, which show lower heat tolerance than females. However, experimental manipulations of hypothesized antioxidant pathways by either glutathione addition or glutathione synthesis inhibition had no effect on heat tolerance. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), contrary to expectations, did not appear to be a predictive measure of susceptibility to thermal damage: LPO was higher, not lower, in more heat tolerant heat-acclimated individuals after exposure to a lethally high temperature. We hypothesize that LPO may be maintained in Daphnia at a constant level in the absence of acute exposure to elevated temperature and increase as a by-product of  a possible protective antioxidant mechanism during such exposure. This conclusion is corroborated by the observed short-term and long-term changes in phospholipid composition that included an increase in fatty acid saturation at 28 °C and up-regulation of certain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Phospholipid composition was more strongly affected by recently experienced temperature (4-day transfer) than by long-term (2 generations) temperature acclimation. This is consistent with partial loss of thermal tolerance after a short-term switch to a reciprocal temperature. As predicted under the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis, the more heat tolerant Daphnia showed lower membrane fluidity than their less heat tolerant counterparts, in comparison both between acclimation temperatures and among different genotypes. We conclude that thermal tolerance in Daphnia is influenced by total antioxidant capacity and membrane fluidity at high temperatures, with both effects possibly reflecting changes in phospholipid composition.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

There is growing concern for the health status of wild and farmed organisms, since environmental stressors alter organism functions, and elicit coordinated physiological responses for homeostasis. Mussels are good bioindicators of environmental conditions. Their ability to maintain unaltered immunosurveillance under adverse environmental conditions may enhance their survival capability. Few studies are currently concerned with the relationships and feedback among multiple stressors. Here, food concentration, temperature, and oxygenation treatments were evaluated for their effects on immune enzymatic parameters of Mytilus galloprovincialis detected in the digestive gland and the lysosomal viability by neutral red uptake. Mussels were exposed to three temperatures (12, 20, and 28 °C) under normoxic (8 mg O2l−1) and anoxic conditions and specimens were fed with six food concentrations, ranging 0.2–5 g chlorophyll l−1. Temperature increases affected esterase and alkaline phophatase enzyme functionality, and addition of food buffered detrimental effects generated by harsh conditions, such as those provided by low oxygen concentrations. Kinetics of the phenoloxidase was negatively correlated with increasing temperature. In this case, food had a buffering effect that counteracted the limiting temperature only under normoxic conditions. In addition, the stability of the lysosomal membrane was altered under conditions of thermal stress and food change, under normoxic and anoxic conditions. Overall, environmental stress factors affected immune biomarkers of Mediterranean mussels, and the level of food acted as a buffer, increasing the thermal resistance of the specimens.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Two patterns of respiration occur during deep hibernation. At 7 °C body temperature (Tb), a breathing pattern characterized by episodes of multiple breaths (20.6 ± 1.9 breaths/episode) separated by long apneas or nonventilatory periods (Tnvp) (mean = 11.1 ± 1.2 min) occurs, while at 4 °C Tb, a pattern in which breaths are evenly distributed and separated by a relatively short Tnvp (0.5 ± 0.05 min) occurs. Squirrels exhibiting each pattern have similar metabolic rates and levels of total ventilation (0.2 and 0.23 ml O2/hr/kg and 0.11 and 0.16 ml air/min/kg, respectively). Squirrels at 7 °C Tb exhibit a significant hypoxic ventilatory response, while squirrels at 4 °C Tb do not respond to hypoxia at any level of O2 tested. Squirrels at both temperatures exhibit a significant hypercapnic ventilatory response, but the response is significantly reduced in the 4 °C Tb squirrels. Carotid body denervation has little effect on the breathing patterns or on the hypercapnic ventilatory responses. It does reduce the magnitude and threshold for the hypoxic ventilatory response. Taken together the data suggest that (1) the fundamental rhythm generator remains functional at low temperatures; (2) the hypercapnic ventilatory response arises from central chemoreceptors that remain functional at very low temperatures; (3) the hypoxic ventilatory response arises from both carotid body and aortic chemoreceptors that are silenced at lower temperatures; and (4) there is a strong correlation between breathing pattern and chemosensitivity.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Generally, organisms can compensate at one or more biological levels, or allow temperature to dictate processes such as enzyme activities through kinetic effects on reaction rates. As digestion also alters physiological processes such as enzyme activities, this study determined the interacting effect of thermal acclimation (8 and 20 °C) and digesting a single meal on maximal enzyme activities in three tissues of the goldfish (Carrassius auratus). Acclimation to elevated temperatures decreased branchial Na+, K+, ATPase (NKA) activity. In contrast, acclimation to elevated temperatures had no effect on citrate synthase (CS) or pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in any tissue, nor were renal NKA or glutamine synthetase (GS) activities impacted. Warm water-acclimation exaggerated the positive impact of digestion on intestinal and branchial NKA activities and intestinal GS activity only, but digestion had no effect in the kidney. CS and PK did not display intestinal zonation; however, there was a distinct increase towards the distal intestine in NKA and GS activities. Zonation of NKA was more prominent in warm-acclimated animals, while acclimation temperature did not affect intestinal heterogeneity of GS. Finally, the impact of tissue protein content on enzyme activity was discussed. We conclude that the intestine and gill of warm-acclimated goldfish exhibited an augmented capacity for increasing several enzyme activities in response to digestion while the kidney was unaffected by thermal acclimation or digesting a single meal. However, this amplified capacity was ameliorated by alterations in tissue protein content. Amplified increases in NKA activity may ultimately have implications for ATP demand in these tissues, while increased GS activity may beneficially increase ammonia-detoxifying capacity in the intestine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Because central adenosine activation has been shown to induce a torpor-like state in the arctic ground squirrel, and blocking the adenosine-1 (A1) receptor prevents daily torpor, we hypothesized that central activation of the A1 adenosine receptors would induce a bout of natural torpor in mice. To test the hypothesis, mice were subjected to four different hypothermia bouts: natural torpor, forced hypothermia (FH), isoflurane-anesthesia, and an intracerebroventricular injection of the selective A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA). All conditions induced profound hypothermia. Tb fell more rapidly in the FH, isoflurane-anesthesia, and CHA conditions compared to torpor, while mice treated with CHA recovered at half the rate of torpid mice. FH, isoflurane-anesthesia, and CHA-treated mice exhibited a diminished drop in HR during entry into hypothermia as compared to torpor. Mice in all conditions except CHA shivered while recovering from hypothermia, and only FH mice shivered substantially while entering hypothermia. Circulating lactate during the hypothermic bouts was not significantly different between the CHA and torpor conditions, both of which had lower than baseline lactate levels. Arrhythmias were largely absent in the FH and isoflurane-anesthesia conditions, while skipped beats were observed in natural torpor and periodic extended (>1 s) HR pauses in the CHA condition. Lastly, the hypothermic bouts showed distinct patterns of gene expression, with torpor characterized by elevated hepatic and cardiac Txnip expression and all other hypothermic states characterized by elevated c-Fos and Egr-1 expression.

Several studies suggested that reduced availability of 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) in the hypothalamus is required for the physiological adaptation to winter in Djungarian hamsters. We have previously shown that T3 is involved in the regulation of daily torpor, but it remains unclear, whether T3 affects torpor by central or peripheral mechanisms. To determine the effect of T3 concentrations within the hypothalamus in regulating daily torpor, we tested the hypothesis that low hypothalamic T3 metabolism would favour torpor and high T3 concentrations would not. In experiment 1 gene expression in torpid hamsters was assessed for transporters carrying thyroid hormones between cerebrospinal fluid and hypothalamic cells and for deiodinases enzymes, activating or inactivating T3 within hypothalamic cells. Gene expression analysis suggests reduced T3 in hypothalamic cells during torpor. In experiment 2, hypothalamic T3 concentrations were altered via microdialysis and torpor behaviour was continuously monitored by implanted body temperature transmitters. Increased T3 concentrations in the hypothalamus reduced expression of torpor as well as torpor bout duration and depth. Subsequent analysis of gene expression in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle showed clear up-regulation of T3 inactivating deiodinase 3 but no changes in several other genes related to photoperiodic adaptations in hamsters. Finally, serum analysis revealed that increased total T3 serum concentrations were not necessary to inhibit torpor expression. Taken together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that T3 availability within the hypothalamus significantly contributes to the regulation of daily torpor via a central pathway.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Moreover, magnetic field effects on prominent aspects of the migratory programme of birds, such as migratory restlessness behaviour, fuel deposition and directional orientation, implicate that geomagnetic information can also be used to derive positional (“map”) information. While the magnetic “compass” in migratory birds is likely to be based on radical pair-forming molecules embedded in their visual system, the sensory correlates underlying a magnetic “map” sense currently remain elusive. Behavioural, physiological and neurobiological findings indicate that the sensor is most likely innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and based on magnetic iron particles. Information from this unknown sensor is neither necessary nor sufficient for a functional magnetic compass, but instead could contribute important components of a multifactorial “map” for global positioning.

Regulated preference for lipid over glucose to fuel metabolism may play an important role. We tested whether providing lipid in an emulsion protects hearts from summer-active AGS better than hearts from Brown Norway (BN) rats against normothermic IR injury. Langendorff-prepared AGS and BN rat hearts were perfused with Krebs solution containing 7.5 mM glucose with or without 1% Intralipid™. After stabilization and cardioplegia, hearts underwent 45-min global ischemia and 60-min reperfusion. Coronary flow, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, and mitochondrial redox state were measured continuously; infarct size was measured at the end of the experiment. Glucose-only AGS hearts functioned significantly better on reperfusion than BN rat hearts. Intralipid™ administration resulted in additional functional improvement in AGS compared to glucose-only and BN rat hearts. Infarct size was not different among groups. Even under non-hibernating conditions, AGS hearts performed better after IR than the best-protected rat strain. This, however, appears to strongly depend on metabolic fuel: Intralipid™ led to a significant improvement in return of function in AGS, but not in BN rat hearts, suggesting that year-round endogenous mechanisms are involved in myocardial lipid utilization that contributes to improved cardiac performance, independent of the metabolic rate decrease during hibernation. Comparative lipid analysis revealed four candidates as possible cardioprotective lipid groups. The improved function in Intralipid™-perfused AGS hearts also challenges the current paradigm that increased glucose and decreased lipid metabolism are favorable during myocardial IR.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In addition, preliminary data indicate night vision-triggered activation in the anterior visual forebrain. This brain area could represent the same brain region, which has previously been named “Cluster N” and shown to be involved in processing magnetic compass information in European Robins. Thus, based on brain activation data, both visually and trigeminally mediated magnetic senses known from other birds seem to exist in Northern Wheatears.

Despite significant similarities between the two groups, differences in the regulatory mechanisms were detected. The present study was performed to carry out investigations of the influence of human leptin and GABAB-receptor agonist and antagonist on the firing rate of neurons of the Nucleus infundibuli hypothalami in brain slices from juvenile chickens. For the first time, we demonstrated a clear, dose-related change in the firing rate of hypothalamic neurons in juvenile chickens after the acute application of recombinant human leptin (1, 10, and 100 nM). All investigated neurons increased their subsequent firing rate. Application of GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen (1 µM) blocked, while antagonist CGP 35348 (10 µM) increased the spontaneous neuronal activity. Simultaneous application of baclofen and leptin reduced the effect observed from single leptin application. This was not found after simultaneously application of leptin and CGP. Altogether, our results indicate that in bird brain slices, and exemplarily in those of the chicken, hypothalamic neurons show mammalian-like responsiveness after acute leptin and GABA application.

The concentration of oxygen to which aquatic organisms are exposed is influenced by salinity, water temperature, weather, and surface water runoff. Hypoxia has a serious effect on fish populations, and can lead to the loss of habitat and die-offs. Therefore, in the present study we used next-generation sequencing technology to characterize the transcriptomes of Pelteobagrus vachelli and identified 70 candidate genes in the HIF-1 signaling pathway that are important for the hypoxic response in all metazoan species. For the first time, the present study reported the effects of acute hypoxia and reoxygenation on oxygen sensors, respiratory metabolism, and hematology indices in P. vachelli. The predicted physiological adjustments show that P. vachelli’s blood oxygen-carrying capacity was increased through increased RBC, HB, and SI after hypoxia exposure. Glycolysis-related enzyme activities (PFK, HK, and PK) and LDH in the brain and liver also increased, indicating a rise in anaerobic metabolism. The observed reduction in oxidative enzyme level (CS) in the liver during hypoxia suggests a concomitant depression in aerobic metabolism. There were significant increases in oxygen sensor mRNA expression and HIF-1α protein expression during hypoxia and reoxygenation exposure, suggesting that the HIF-1 signaling pathway was activated in the liver and brain of P. vachelli in response to acute hypoxia and reoxygenation.

As a result of these findings, classic thermoregulatory categories of ‘homeothermy’, ‘daily heterothermy’, and ‘hibernation’ are becoming harder to delineate, impeding our understanding of the physiological and evolutionary significance of variation within and around these categories. However, we lack a generalized analytical approach for evaluating and comparing the complex and diversified nature of the full breadth of heterothermy expressed by individuals, populations, and species. Here we propose a new approach that decomposes body temperature time series into three inherent properties—waveform, amplitude, and period—using a non-stationary technique that accommodates the temporal variability of body temperature patterns. This approach quantifies circadian and seasonal variation in thermoregulatory patterns, and uses the distribution of observed thermoregulatory patterns as a basis for intra- and inter-specific comparisons.

In key respects, this hypothermia is more akin to hibernation than was thought during much of the twentieth century, indicating that studies of neonatal hypothermia may usefully supplement studies of hibernation in understanding evolved tissue adaptations to near-freezing Tb. To clarify evolutionary diversity in neonatal survival of deep hypothermia, neonates of six species or strains were subjected to a standardized procedure: exposure for 2.5 h to test Tbs followed by autoresuscitation. Mus and Peromyscus differed dramatically, the lowest Tb survived by all ages studied (3–10 days) being 7–8 °C in Mus and 0–1 °C in Peromyscus. There was, however, no evidence of intrageneric plasticity because feral and laboratory Mus were identical, and Peromyscus species with cold- and warm-climate distribution ranges were identical. When neonates survive deep hypothermia, a key question is whether the experience is benign, meaning neonates tolerate hypothermia. To test the benign nature of deep hypothermia, neonates of Peromyscus leucopus were exposed four times (3 h each) to Tb = 1–2 °C when 3–10 days old; controls were same-sex siblings not hypothermia exposed. When 74 such sibling pairs were exposed after weaning to predation by screech owls, the hypothermia-treated and control siblings did not differ in which was caught first.

Successful accelerometer studies have recently been conducted also for free-flying small songbirds during their entire annual cycle. Here we review the principles and possibilities for accelerometer studies in bird migration. We use the first annual actograms (for red-backed shrike Lanius collurio) to explore new analyses and insights that become possible with accelerometer data. Actogram data allow precise estimates of numbers of flights, flight durations as well as departure/landing times during the annual cycle. Annual and diurnal rhythms of migratory flights, as well as prolonged nocturnal flights across desert barriers are illustrated. The shifting balance between flight, rest and different intensities of activity throughout the year as revealed by actogram data can be used to analyse exertion levels during different phases of the life cycle. Accelerometer recording of the annual activity patterns of individual birds will open up a new dimension in bird migration research.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

An important step towards this goal involves the establishment of three-dimensional high-resolution brain maps, incorporating brain-wide information about the cells and their connections, as well as the chemical architecture. The progress made in such anatomical brain mapping in recent years has been paralleled by the development of physiological techniques that enable investigators to generate global neural activity maps, also with cellular resolution, while simultaneously recording the organism’s behavioral activity.

A critical view on stopover ecology studies and some future perspectives,"In birds, accumulating energy is far slower than spending energy during flight. During migration, birds spend, therefore, most of the time at stopover refueling energy used during the previous flight. This elucidates why current energy stores and actual rate of accumulating energy are likely crucial factors influencing bird’s decision when to resume migration in addition to other intrinsic (sex, age) and extrinsic (predation, weather) factors modulating the decision within the innate migration program. After first summarizing how energy stores and stopover durations are generally determined, we critically review that high-energy stores and low rates of accumulating energy were significantly related to high departure probabilities in several bird groups. There are, however, also many studies showing no effect at all. Recent radio-tracking studies highlighted that migrants leave a site either to resume migration or to search for a better stopover location, so-called “landscape movements”. Erroneously treating such movements as departures increases the likelihood of type II errors which might mistakenly suggest no effect of either trait on departure. Furthermore, we propose that energy loss during the previous migratory flight in relation to bird’s current energy stores and migration strategy significantly affects its urge to refuel and hence its departure decision.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A microfluidic vascular injury model was performed to differentiate the effects of temperature and shear rate on platelet adhesion to collagen. Human and ground squirrel whole blood was incubated at 15 or 37 °C and then passed through a microfluidic chamber over a 250-µm strip of type I fibrillar collagen at that temperature and the shear rates of 50 or 300 s−1 to simulate torpid and aroused conditions, respectively. At 15 °C, both human and ground squirrel platelets showed a 90–95% decrease in accumulation on collagen independent of shear rate. At 37 °C, human platelet accumulation reduced by 50% at 50 s−1 compared to 300 s−1, while ground squirrel platelet accumulation dropped by 80%. When compared to platelets from non-hibernating animals, platelets from animals collected after arousal from torpor showed a 60% decrease in binding at 37 °C and 300 s−1, but a 2.5-fold increase in binding at 15 °C and 50 s−1. vWF binding in platelets from hibernating ground squirrels was decreased by 50% relative to non-hibernating platelets. The source of the plasma that platelets were stored in did not affect the results indicating that the decreased vWF binding was a property of the platelets. Upon chilling, ground squirrel platelets increase microtubule assembly leading to the formation of long rods. This shape change is concurrent with sequestration of platelets in the liver and not the spleen. In conclusion, it appears that ground squirrel platelets are sequestered in the liver during torpor and have reduced binding capacity for plasma vWF and lower accumulation on collagen at low shear rates and after storage at cold temperatures, while still being activated by external agonists. These adaptations would protect the animals from spontaneous thrombus formation during torpor but allow them to restore normal platelet function upon arousal.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The molecular drivers of the drastic physiological changes that orchestrate and permit torpor are not well understood. Although transcription effectively ceases at the low body temperatures of torpor, previous work has demonstrated that some transcripts are protected from bulk degradation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), consistent with the importance of their protein products for metabolic heat generation during arousal from torpor. We examined the transcriptome of skeletal muscle, heart, and liver to determine the patterns of differentially expressed genes in these tissues, and whether, like BAT, a subset of these were relatively increased during torpor. EDGE-tags were quantified from five distinct physiological states representing the seasonal and torpor-arousal cycles of 13-lined ground squirrels. Supervised clustering on relative transcript abundances with Random Forest separated the two states bracketing prolonged torpor, entrance into and aroused from torpor, in all three tissues. Independent analyses identified 3347, 6784, and 2433 differentially expressed transcripts among all sampling points in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, respectively. There were few differentially expressed genes in common across all three tissues; these were enriched in mitochondrial and apoptotic pathway components. Divisive clustering of these data revealed unique cohorts of transcripts that increased across the torpor bout in each tissue with patterns reflecting various combinations of cycling within and between seasons as well as between torpor and arousal. Transcripts that increased across the torpor bout were likewise tissue specific. These data shed new light on the biochemical pathways that alter in concert with hibernation phenotype and provide a rich resource for further hypothesis-based studies.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, whether circadian rhythms persist and are functionally important during hibernation in all mammals is currently unclear. We examined whether circadian rhythms of body temperature (Tb) persist during multi-day, steady-state torpor and investigated the association between timing of animal emergence, exposure to light, and resumption of activity and Tb rhythms in free-living and captive male arctic ground squirrels. High-resolution (0.02 °C) temperature loggers revealed that circadian rhythms of Tb were not present during deep torpor in free-living arctic ground squirrels. Significant circadian rhythms of Tb resumed, however, following the resumption of euthermia, but prior to emergence, though rhythms became much more robust coincident with aboveground emergence. Additionally, squirrels maintained in captivity under conditions of constant darkness spontaneously developed significant circadian rhythms of Tb and activity soon after ending torpor. Exposing animals to a 5-s pulse of light within a week when they ended torpor increased the strength of rhythms. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that circadian clock function is inhibited during hibernation in arctic ground squirrels, and we postulate that exposure to external stimuli, such as light in free-living animals, and meals or acute disturbance for captive squirrels, may enhance Tb rhythmicity by synchronizing loosely coupled circadian oscillators within the suprachiasmatic nucleus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To address this issue, we investigated thermal relations of three sympatric lizard species (Eremias argus, Eremias multiocellata, and Phrynocephalus przewalskii) in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. We determined the thermoregulatory behavior, body temperature (Tb), operative temperature (Te), selected body temperature (Tsel), and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of adult lizards. Based on these physiological parameters, we quantified the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation as well as thermal-safety margin for these species. The three species were accurate and effective thermoregulators. The P. przewalskii preferred open habitats, and had a higher Tb than the two Eremias lizards, which preferred shade habitats and shuttled more frequently between the shade and sun. This indicated that the three sympatric lizards have different thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology, which might facilitate their coexistence in the desert steppe ecosystem. In addition, the P. przewalskii had higher Tsel and CTmax, and a wider thermal-safety margin than the two Eremias lizards, suggesting that the two Eremias lizards would be more vulnerable to climate warming than P. przewalskii.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Specifically, mammalian hibernators consistently show an overall increase in the blood–O2 affinity, which causes a decreased O2 unloading to tissues, while having similar or lower tissue O2 tensions during hibernation. This overview explores how the decreased body temperature and concentration of red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) that occur in hibernation contribute separately or in combination to the concurrent increase in the O2 affinity of the hemoglobin, the O2 carrier protein of the blood. Most mammalian hemoglobins are responsive to changes in DPG concentrations, including that of the hibernating brown bear, although the smaller hibernators, such as golden-mantled ground squirrel, chipmunks, and dormice, have hemoglobins with low sensitivity to DPG. While the effect of DPG on oxygenation may vary, the decrease in body temperature invariably increases hemoglobin’s O2 affinity in all hibernating species. However, the temperature sensitivity of hemoglobin oxygenation is low in hibernators compared to human, apparently due in part to endothermic allosteric quaternary transition in ground squirrels and dissociation of chloride ions in brown bears. A low heat of blood oxygenation in temporal heterotherms, like hibernators, may thus contribute to reduce heat loss, as found in regional heterotherms, like polar mammals, although the significance would be low in winter hibernation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A previous study of this therapy tested only one concentration of three specific components: 4 M D-stereoisomer of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), 43 mM melatonin, and 20% DMSO. In this study, we considered the range of concentrations of BHB and melatonin seen during the physiological extremes of rapid arousal from hypothermic torpor in natural hibernators and applied these to the non-hibernating Sprague–Dawley rat model. These extremes normally result in ischemia and reperfusion injury in non-hibernating mammals. Dose-ranging studies were conducted for BHB and melatonin in rats with 60% blood loss. BHB was administered at either 4, 2, or 0.4 M concentration in conjunction with 4.3 mM melatonin and 10% DMSO. Subsequently, melatonin was administered at either 4.3, 0.43, 0.0043, 0.000043, or 0 mM in conjunction with 4 M BHB and 2% DMSO. 10-day mean survival showed a dose-dependent trend: rats survived longer with higher concentration of infused BHB (4 M BHB, 7.38 ± 1.75 days; 2 M BHB, 5.25 ± 2.22 days; 0.4 M BHB, 2.07 ± 2.05 days). Administering 4 M BHB without melatonin resulted in low mean survival times (4.38 ± 1.42 days).

An exception is Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), the only standard laboratory animal showing deep hibernation. In deep hibernators, several factors influence hibernation quality, including body mass, sex and diet. We examined hibernation quality in commercially obtained Syrian hamsters in relation to body mass, sex and a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animals (M/F:30/30, 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan (IN, USA) and individually housed at 21 °C and L:D 14:10 until 20 weeks of age, followed by L:D 8:16 until 27 weeks. Then conditions were changed to 5 °C and L:D 0:24 for 9 weeks to induce hibernation. Movement was continuously monitored with passive infrared detectors. Hamsters were randomized to control diet or a diet 3× enriched in linoleic acid from 16 weeks of age. Hamsters showed a high rate of premature death (n = 24, 40%), both in animals that did and did not initiate torpor, which was unrelated to body weight, sex and diet. Time to death (31.7 ± 3.1 days, n = 12) or time to first torpor bout (36.6 ± 1.6 days, n = 12) was similar in prematurely deceased hamsters. Timing of induction of hibernation and duration of torpor and arousal was unaffected by body weight, sex or diet. Thus, commercially obtained Syrian hamsters subjected to winter conditions showed poor survival, irrespective of body weight, sex and diet. These factors also did not affect hibernation parameters. Possibly, long-term commercial breeding from a confined genetic background has selected against the hibernation trait.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important for thermogenesis during periodic arousals from hibernation when core body temperature rises spontaneously from 5 to 37 °C. In most small eutherians BAT growth requires several weeks of cold exposure. We hypothesized that in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), a hibernator, BAT growth is regulated, in part, by an endogenous rhythm and we predicted that this growth would precede the hibernation season without cold exposure. We tested this prediction using repeated water–fat magnetic resonance imaging over a year, including the hibernation season. Thoracic BAT depots increased in volume from spring through autumn even though animals were housed at ~22 °C. Subsequent cold exposure (5 °C) enlarged the thoracic BAT further. The fat fraction of this tissue fell significantly during the period of peak growth, indicating relative increases in non-triglyceride components, perhaps mitochondria or vasculature. We also found that the proportion of the body consisting of white adipose tissue (WAT) increased steadily from spring through autumn, and fell throughout hibernation, mirroring changes in body mass. Unlike BAT, WAT fat fractions remained constant (near 90%) throughout the year. Future studies will evaluate the significance of photoperiod and cold exposure on the growth of these tissues. We also found tissue with a fat fraction characteristic of BAT in the head near the eyes, a potentially novel discovery that requires further confirmation.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It is ammonotelic in fresh water, but retains the capacities of urea synthesis and ureosmotic osmoregulation to survive in brackish water. This study aimed to elucidate the roles of Rhesus glycoproteins (Rhgp), which are known to transport ammonia, in conserving nitrogen (N) in H. signifer during brackish water acclimation when N became limited resulting from increased hepatic urea synthesis. The complete coding sequence of rhbg from H. signifer consisted of 1383 bp, encoding 460 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 50.5 kDa, while that of rhcg comprised 1395 bp, encoding for 464 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 50.8 kDa. The deduced amino sequences of Rhbg and Rhcg contained ammonia binding sites, which could recruit NH4+ to be deprotonated, and a hydrophobic pore with two histidine residues, which could mediate the transport of NH3. Our results indicated for the first time that brackish water acclimation resulted in significant decreases in the expression levels of rhbg/Rhbg and rhcg/Rhcg in the gills of H. signifer, which offered a mechanistic explanation of brackish water-related decreased ammonia excretion reported elsewhere. Furthermore, rhbg/Rhbg expression levels increased significantly in the liver of H. signifer during brackish water acclimation, indicating that the ammonia produced by extra-hepatic tissues and released into the blood could be channeled into the liver for increased urea synthesis. Overall, these results lend support to the proposition that H. signifer becomes N-limited upon utilizing urea as an osmolyte in brackish water.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Maximum body temperatures and the use of torpor during the active season in edible dormice,"Measuring Tb during the active season can provide information about the timing of reproduction and the use of short bouts of torpor and may be used as a proxy for the locomotor activity of animals (i.e., maximum Tb). This kind of information is especially important to understand life-history strategies and energetic costs and demands in hibernating mammals. We investigated Tb throughout the active season in edible dormice (Glis glis), since they (i) have an expensive arboreal life-style, (ii) are known to show short bouts of torpor, and (iii) are adapted to pulsed resources (mast of beech trees). We show here for the first time that maximum Tb’s in free-living active dormice (during the night) increase regularly and for up to 8 h above 40 °C, which corresponds to slight hyperthermia, probably due to locomotor activity. The highest weekly mean maximum Tb was recorded 1 week prior to hibernation (40.45 ± 0.07 °C). At the beginning of the active season and immediately prior to hibernation, the mean maximum Tb’s were lower. The time dormice spent at Tb above 40 °C varied between sexes, depending on mast conditions. The date of parturition could be determined by a sudden increase in mean Tb (plus 0.49 ± 0.04 °C). The occurrence of short torpor bouts (<24 h) was strongly affected by the mast situation with much higher torpor frequencies in mast-failure years.

Different ionic conductances contribute to the properties of individual neurons and therefore to the overall dynamics of the pyloric and gastric mill networks. However, the contributions of ionic currents to different dynamics between the pyloric and gastric mill networks are not well understood. The goal of this study is to evaluate how changes in outward potassium current (IA) in the stomatogastric ganglion affect the dynamics of the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms by interfering with normal IA activity. We bath-applied the specific IA blocker 4-aminopyridine to reduce IA’s effect in the stomatogastric ganglion in vitro and evaluated quantitatively the changes in both rhythms.

A crucial first step in recognition is the identification of edges and the segmentation of the visual field into areas that belong together. Honeybees and bumblebees acquire visual information through three types of photoreceptors; however, they only use a single receptor type—the one sensitive to longer wavelengths—for edge detection and movement detection. Here, we show that these long-wavelength receptors (peak sensitivity at ~544 nm, i.e., green) provide the most consistent signals in response to natural objects. Using our multispectral image database of flowering plants, we found that long-wavelength receptor responses had, depending on the specific scenario, up to four times higher signal-to-noise ratios than the short- and medium-wavelength receptors. The reliability of the long-wavelength receptors emerges from an intricate interaction between flower coloration and the bee’s visual system. This finding highlights the adaptive significance of bees using only long-wavelength receptors to locate flowers among leaves, before using information provided by all three receptors to distinguish the rewarding flower species through trichromatic color vision.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The small-bodied, nocturnal primate Lepilemur leucopus lives in this harsh habitat with high diurnal and seasonal changes in ambient temperature. In this study, we investigated seasonal adaptions in energy budgeting of L. leucopus, which allow it to live under these conditions by measuring resting metabolic rate using open-flow respirometry. No signs of heterothermy were detected, and resting metabolic rate was significantly lower in the warmer wet season than in the colder dry season. In fact, L. leucopus possesses one of the lowest mass-specific metabolic rates measured so far for an endotherm, probably the result of adaptations to its habitat and folivorous and potentially toxic diet. Surprisingly, we identified a shift of the thermoneutral zone from between 25 and 30 °C in the wet season to between 29 and 32 °C in the cool dry season. L. leucopus seems to be more affected by the hot daytime temperatures during the dry season and thermoregulation seems to be more costly during this time, which makes this shift of the thermoneutral zone advantageous.

Indeed, HF of migratory birds displays anatomical properties that differ from non-migratory species. Using a hypothetical framework of multiple maps of differing spatial resolution and range, homing pigeon data suggest that HF is important for navigating by landscape features near familiar breeding, over-wintering, and stop-over sites. By contrast, HF would be unimportant for an olfactory navigational map, which could be operational over unfamiliar space farther away from a goal location, nor is there any evidence for HF involvement in the sun or geomagnetic compass. The most intriguing question that remains open is what role HF may play in navigation when a migrant is thousands kms away from a familiar area, where homing pigeon data are uninformative and a geomagnetic map may be operational. Beyond navigation, successful migration depends on seasonal timing and often becoming nocturnally active. There is little evidence that HF plays a role in the timing of circannual and circadian cycles. Rather, circadian pacemakers including the pineal gland may control circadian timing of nocturnal restlessness and photoperiodic seasonal pacemakers likely control circannual expression.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Preferential pHi regulation is thought to be associated with hypercarbia tolerance in general, but has also recently been observed to protect pHi against metabolic acidoses induced by exhaustive exercise and anoxia in a tropical air breathing catfish. We hypothesized that preferential pHi regulation may also be a general strategy of acid–base regulation in sturgeon. To address this hypothesis, severe acidoses were imposed to reduce pHe, and the presence or absence of preferential pHi regulation was assessed in red blood cells (RBC), heart, brain, liver and white muscle. A respiratory acidosis was imposed using hyperoxia, while metabolic acidoses were induced by exhaustive exercise, anoxia or air exposure. Reductions in pHe occurred following hyperoxia (0.15 units), exhaustive exercise (0.30 units), anoxia (0.10 units) and air exposure (0.35 units); all acidoses reduced RBC pHi. Following hyperoxia, heart, brain and liver pHi were preferentially regulated against the reduction in pHe, similar to hypercarbia exposure. Following all metabolic acidoses heart pHi was protected and brain pHi remained unchanged following exhaustive exercise and air exposure, however, brain pHi was reduced following anoxia. Liver and white muscle pHi were reduced following all metabolic acidoses.

Based on the sequenced milkfish transcriptome, an NKA β1 subunit gene was identified that had the highest amino acid homology to β233, a NKA β1 subunit paralog originally identified in the eel. Despite this high level of homology to β233, phylogenetic analysis and the fact that only a single NKA β1 subunit gene exists in the milkfish suggest that the milkfish gene should be referred to as the NKA β1 subunit gene. The results of accurate domain prediction of the β1 subunit, co-localization of α1 and β1 subunits in epithelial ionocytes, and co-immunoprecipitation of α1 and β1 subunits, indicated the formation of a α1–β1 complex in milkfish gills. Moreover, when transferred to hyposmotic media (fresh water) from seawater, parallel increases in branchial mRNA and protein expression of NKA α1 and β1 subunits suggested their roles in hypo-osmoregulation of euryhaline milkfish. This study molecularly characterized the NKA β1 subunit and provided the first evidence for an NKA α1–β1 association in gill ionocytes of euryhaline teleosts.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We quantified the cooling rates of marsupial dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) at 40–56 days (d) old, and torpor and basking behaviour in animals given the option to bask in four age groups from 60 to 150 d. The development of thermoregulation was a continuum, but was characterised by three major thermoregulatory stages: (1) at 40 d, animals were unable to maintain a constant high body temperature during short-term cold exposure; (2) at 60 d, animals could maintain a high Tb for the first part of the night at an ambient temperature of 15.0 ± 0.7 °C; later in the night, they entered an apparent torpor bout but could only rewarm passively when basking under a heat lamp; (3) from ~90 d, they expressed prolonged torpor bouts and were able to rewarm endogenously. Young newly weaned 60 d animals were able to avoid hypothermia by basking. In this case, basking was not an optional behavioural method of reducing the cost of rewarming from torpor, but was essential for thermoregulation independent of the nest temperature. Results from our study suggest that basking is a crucial behavioural trait that permits young marsupials and perhaps other juvenile altricial mammals to overcome the developmental stage between poikilothermy early in development and full endothermy later in life.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the present study, we used wild túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) to investigate the effects of AVT on phonotaxis in males and females—thereby controlling for potential task differences between the sexes. Using a combined within- and between-subjects design, we showed that acoustic choice behavior in female frogs is not influenced by injection per se (vehicle) or by AVT. Latency to choice in females, however, tends to decrease after AVT injection, supporting the hypothesis that AVT promotes female sexual arousal. In contrast, male choice behavior and latencies are negatively impacted by injection (vehicle) but rescued to pre-injection levels if administered with AVT. The sexes differed in area restricted searching (ARS) following choice—a measure of locomotor perseverance—with females but not males exhibiting ARS. AVT did not influence ARS behavior but ARS frequency was positively associated with the attractiveness of the acoustic stimulus. Finally, we showed that a female’s latency behavior is correlated with her partner’s behavior. Collectively we show that AVT promotes phonotaxis in both sexes in a dimorphic manner—a result that is consistent with sex differences in the neural vasotocin system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

FXYD11 is a putative regulatory subunit of the NKA pump. The regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase and FXYD11 is of critical importance for osmotic homeostasis. To investigate the changes of the two genes under different salinity environments, we first identified NKA (AmNKAα1) and FXYD11 (AmFXYD11) in Anguilla marmorata, and then evaluated the mRNA levels of NKA and FXYD11 as well as the activity of NKA in the gill and kidney at different timepoints (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 360 h) under three salinity conditions-0‰ (fresh water: FW), 10‰ (brackish water: BW), and 25‰ (seawater: SW). In the gill, the mRNA levels of AmNKAα1 and AmFXYD11 and the enzyme activity of AmNKAα1 were higher in BW and SW than in FW; the protein abundance was positively correlated with the specific activity of NKA in BW/SW. However, in the kidney, the mRNA level of AmNKAα1 in the BW group was higher than that in the FW group. In addition, AmFXYD mRNA levels in both BW and SW groups were significantly lower than that in the FW control group. These results suggested that AmFXYD11 was tissue specific in response to different salinity environment.

For example, Mus musculus do not readily imitate sounds, a trait known as vocal learning and a feature of speech. In contrast, thousands of bird species exhibit this ability. The circuits and underlying molecular mechanisms appear similar between disparate avian orders and are shared with humans. An advantage of studying vocal learning birds is that the neurons dedicated to this trait are nested within the surrounding brain regions, providing anatomical targets for relating brain and behavior. In songbirds, these nuclei are known as the song control system. Molecular function can be interrogated in non-traditional model organisms by exploiting the ability of viruses to insert genetic material into neurons to drive expression of experimenter-defined genes. To date, the use of viruses in the song control system is limited. Here, we review prior successes and test additional viruses for their capacity to transduce basal ganglia song control neurons.

Sex differences in longevity within a species can be useful to understand sex-specific aging. Drosophila melanogaster is a good model to study the problem of sex differences in longevity since females are longer lived than males. There is evidence that stress resistance influences longevity. The objective of this study was to investigate if there is a relationship between sex differences in longevity and oxidative stress resistance in D. melanogaster. We observed a progressive age-dependent decrease in the activity of SOD and catalase, major antioxidant enzymes involved in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress in parallel to the increased ROS levels over time. Longer-lived females showed lower ROS levels and higher antioxidant enzymes than males as a function of age. Using ethanol as a stressor, we have shown differential susceptibility of the sexes to ethanol wherein females exhibited higher resistance to ethanol-induced mortality and locomotor behavior compared to males. Our results show strong correlation between sex differences in oxidative stress resistance, antioxidant defenses and longevity. The study suggests that higher antioxidant defenses in females may confer resistance to oxidative stress, which could be a factor that influences sex-specific aging in D. melanogaster.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This led to the discovery of a somatosensory fovea that parallels the visual fovea of primates in several ways. Subsequent experiments to investigate the assumed superiority of star-nosed moles to their relatives when locating food led to the unexpected discovery of stereo olfaction in common moles. The exceptional olfactory abilities of common moles, in turn, helped to explain an unusual bait-collecting technique called “worm-grunting” in the American southeast.

The animals were subjected to the following experimental treatments: (1) normal feeding (control), (2) food deprivation for 21 days; and (3) re-feeding for 7 days, beginning 14 days after starvation. The animals were sampled at 0, 7, 14 and 21 days from the beginning of the trial. The pituitary and plasma arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT) levels and the hypothalamic pro-vasotocin and pro-isotocin mRNA expression levels were measured. In addition, the mRNA levels of three receptors, avtr v1, avtr v2 and itr, were analyzed in target organs associated with (1) the integration and control of different physiological pathways related to stress and food intake (i.e., the hypothalamus), (2) hormonal release into the bloodstream (i.e., the pituitary), and (3) metabolism and its control (i.e., the liver). The metabolic parameters in the liver were also determined. The hepatosomatic index decreased, and hepatic metabolites were mobilized beginning in the early stages of starvation. Moreover, an over-compensation of these parameters occurred when the fish were re-fed after starvation. In terms of the vasotocinergic and isotocinergic systems, feed restriction induced a clear time-dependent regulation among metabolic organization, stress regulation and orexigenic processes in the mature hormone concentration and pro-peptide and receptor mRNA expression.

For the first time, we studied some physiological and morphological processes involved in Neohelice granulata intermolt female crabs becoming receptive and potentially attracting males. We found that receptive females have mobile vulvae opercula due to a softening process of the cuticle hinge which showed lower calcium levels compared to the hinge of unreceptive females. Local softening of the hinge was stimulated by a low concentration of ecdysone during the intermolt period. A putative pheromone liberated by receptive females to attract males is presumed to be released through the mobile vulvae and not through the urine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Consistent with this, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is expressed in the apical membrane of the ileal epithelial cells and the pancreatic or secretory variant of the NaHCO3 cotransporter in the basolateral membrane. This suggests that in the possum ileum, electrogenic HCO3− secretion is driven by basolateral NaHCO3 cotransporter (NBC) activity. To determine if the NBC contributes to HCO3− secretion in the possum ileum, intracellular pH (pHi) measurements in isolated villi were used to demonstrate NBC activity in the ileal epithelial cells and investigate the effect of cAMP-dependent secretagogues. In CO2/HCO3−-free solutions, recovery of the epithelial cells from an acid load was Na+-dependent and ≈80% inhibited by ethyl-isopropyl-amiloride (EIPA, 10 µmol L−1), indicative of the presence of an Na+/H+ exchanger, most likely NHE1.

Under steady-state conditions, NHE1 inhibition by EIPA had little effect on pHi in the presence or absence of secretagogues, but NBC inhibition with DIDS resulted in a rapid acidification of the cells, which was increased fivefold by secretagogues. These data demonstrate the functional activity of an NaHCO3 cotransporter in the ileal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the stimulation of NBC activity by secretagogues is consistent with the involvement of an NaHCO3 cotransporter in electrogenic HCO3− secretion.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although a freeze might be the more risky choice, it keeps the animal near the expected food reward, while a tail-flip is effective in avoiding the shadow, but puts critical distance between the animal and its next meal. We manipulated the satiation level of juvenile crayfish to determine whether their behavioral choices are affected by internal energy states. When facing the same visual danger signal, animals fed to satiation produced more tail-flips and fewer freezes than unfed animals, indicating that intrinsic physiological conditions shape value-based behavioral decisions. Escape tail-flip latencies, however, were unaffected by satiation level, and an increase in food quality only produced a minor behavioral shift toward more freezing in both fed and unfed animals. Thus, satiation level appears to be the dominant factor in regulating decision making and behavioral choices of crayfish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The effectiveness of vision in assessing cues such as motion and shape is influenced by the ability of the visual system to detect changes in contrast in both space and time. Understanding the role vision plays in shark behaviour has been limited by a lack of knowledge about their temporal resolution, contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study, an electrophysiological approach was used to compare these measures across five species of sharks: Chiloscyllium punctatum, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, Mustelus mustelus and Haploblepharus edwardsii. All shark species were highly sensitive to brightness contrast and were able to detect contrast differences as low as 1.6%. Temporal resolution of flickering stimuli ranged from 28 to 44 Hz. Species that inhabit brighter environments were found to have higher temporal resolution. Spatial resolving power was estimated in C. punctatum, H. portusjacksoni and H. ocellatum and ranged from 0.10 to 0.35 cycles per degree, which is relatively low compared to other vertebrates.

Hence, from a physiological point of view the metabolism of a migrant has to switch between an active fasting phase during flight and a fuelling phase during stopover. To meet the energetic and water requirements of endurance flight, migratory birds have to store an optimal fuel composition and they have to be able to quickly mobilize and deliver sufficient energy to the working flight muscles. After flight, birds have to recover from a strenuous exercise and sleeplessness, but, at the same time, they have to be alert to escape from predators and to prepare the next flight bout.

Whereas the factors influencing migrants’ motivation to fuel are well described, the physiological mechanism regulating fueling is largely unknown. Hormones are likely involved and arguably the best studied with respect to food intake and fueling is corticosterone. Corticosterone has a permissive effect, as blocking the hormone’s actions prohibits efficient fueling. There are no indications, though that corticosterone stimulates fueling, and some studies even observed negative correlations between corticosterone level and food intake and speed of fueling. The latter is unexpected as slow fueling could reduce the overall speed of migration. To test the causality of these negative correlations, I non-invasively increased circulating corticosterone levels in captive migrants and determined its effect on food intake and fuel accumulation. Neither food intake nor fuel accumulation differed between corticosterone-treated and control-treated individuals. This indicates that corticosterone does not hamper food intake and fueling during stopovers, nor does it stimulate these processes.

This is especially true in túngara frog breeding aggregations, where multiple males produce overlapping calls that consist of an FM ‘whine’ followed by harmonic bursts called ‘chucks’. Phonotactic females use at least two cues to group whines and chucks: whine-chuck spatial separation and sequence. Spatial separation is a primitive cue, whereas sequence is schema-based, as chuck production is morphologically constrained to follow whines, meaning that males cannot produce the components simultaneously. When one cue is available, females perceptually group whines and chucks using relative comparisons: components with the smallest spatial separation or those closest to the natural sequence are more likely grouped. By simultaneously varying the temporal sequence and spatial separation of a single whine and two chucks, this study measured between-cue perceptual weighting during a specific grouping task. Results show that whine-chuck spatial separation is a stronger grouping cue than temporal sequence, as grouping is more likely for stimuli with smaller spatial separation and non-natural sequence than those with larger spatial separation and natural sequence.

For newborn calves, hearing could fill an important function in maintaining contact with the mother and to develop echolocation skills. We non-invasively measured the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in two neonate (age 1–4 days) and three adult harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). The stimuli consisted of clicks centred at 130 kHz, which is within the frequency band used for echolocation and communication in this species. The temporal pattern of the neonate ABRs was indistinguishable to the adult ones. There were no significant differences between calves and adults regarding hearing thresholds and ABR latencies. The ABR amplitudes were up to more than an order of magnitude larger in newborns than in adults, most likely due to the neonates’ smaller size. These results indicate that hearing is fully developed within a day after birth, which suggests that harbour porpoise neonates have the earliest hearing development of any mammal studied so far. This may be explained by the evolutionary pressures imposed by the aquatic environment for a rapid development of the key sensory system in harbour porpoises.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

When encountered with an artificial signal of higher frequency than the fish’s discharge, the fish raised its discharge frequency and eventually matched its own frequency to that of the artificial signal. At this moment, phase locking was observed, where the timing of the fish’s discharge was precisely stabilized at a particular phase of the artificial signal over a long period of time (up to minutes) with microsecond precision. Analyses of the phase-locking behaviors revealed that the phase values of the artificial stimulus at which the fish stabilizes the phase of its own discharge (called lock-in phases) have three populations between −180° and +180°. During the frequency rise and the phase-locking behavior, the electrosensory system is exposed to the mixture of feedback signals from its electric organ discharges and the artificial signal. Since the signal mixture modulates in both amplitude and phase, we explored whether amplitude or phase information participated in driving the phase-locking behavior, using a numerical model. The model which incorporates only amplitude information well predicted the three populations of lock-in phases. When phase information was removed from the electrosensory stimulus, phase-locking behavior was still observed. These results suggest that phase-locking behavior of Adontosternarchus requires amplitude information but not phase information available in the electrosensory stimulus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study aimed to clone myostatin (mstn/Mstn), a factor associated with disuse muscle atrophy in mammals, from the skeletal muscle of the African lungfish Protopterus annectens, and to determine its mRNA expression level and protein abundance therein during the induction, maintenance, and arousal phases of aestivation. The complete coding cDNA sequence of mstn comprised 1128 bp, encoding for 376 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 42.9 kDa. It was grouped together with Mstn/MSTN of coelacanth and tetrapods in a clade separated from teleost Mstn. After 6 days (the induction phase) of aestivation, the mstn transcript level in the muscle increased significantly, while the protein abundance of Mstn remained comparable to the control. Following that, a significant increase in the expression levels of mstn/Mstn occurred on day 12 (the early maintenance phase) of aestivation. After 6 months of aestivation (the prolonged maintenance phase), the expression levels of mstn/Mstn returned to control levels, indicating the possible impediment of a drastic increase in muscle degradation to prevent muscle atrophy. During 1–3 days of arousal from aestivation, the expression levels of mstn/Mstn in the muscle remained comparable to the control. Hence, tissue reconstruction/regeneration of certain organs might not involve the mobilization of amino acids from the muscle during the early arousal. These results provide insights into how aestivating P. annectens regulates the expression of mstn/Mstn possibly to ameliorate disuse muscle atrophy.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In 2011, a gene for a distinct disaccharide sucrose transporter (SCRT) was found in Drosophila melanogaster and characterized in a yeast expression system. The purpose of the present investigation was to functionally identify and characterize a putative disaccharide transporter analog in the hepatopancreas of the American lobster, Homarus americanus. Purified hepatopancreatic brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were used in transport experiments using 14C-sucrose and a Millipore filter isolation technique. In the absence of sodium, an external pH of 4 significantly stimulated the uptake of 14C-sucrose compared to that occurring at pH 5, 6, or 7. At pH 7, increasing external concentrations of sodium increased 14C-sucrose uptake by BBMV in a hyperbolic fashion and this stimulation was significantly reduced when the pH was changed to 4, suggesting that both protons and sodium ions were each capable of driving the uptake of the sugar. In experiments with a variety of monosaccharides, disaccharides, and trisaccharides, used as potential inhibitors of 14C-sucrose uptake, only maltose and trehalose inhibited carrier-mediated 14C-sucrose transport. An additional experiment showed that 20 mM maltose was a competitive inhibitor of 14C-sucrose uptake. The use of a putative lobster SCRT by both maltose and trehalose is nutritionally appropriate for lobsters as they commonly digest glycogen and chitin, polymers of maltose and trehalose, respectively. These findings suggest there is a brush-border proton- or sodium-dependent, hepatopancreatic carrier process, shared by sucrose, maltose, and trehalose, that may function to absorb disaccharides that are produced from digestion of naturally occurring dietary constituents.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Reproduction is considered one of the most energetically demanding life-history stages. Therefore, the amount of energy an individual invests in reproduction might carry fitness costs through reduced energy allocation to other activities such as health maintenance. We investigated whether reproduction impacts health in the seasonally breeding African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). We measured health in individuals that reproduced (breeders) and individuals that did not reproduce (their adult offspring) and tested whether: (1) breeders’ health before reproduction was similar to that of their offspring (representing a baseline); (2) breeders’ health deteriorated after reproduction; (3) breeders’ health after reproduction was worse than that of their offspring. We collected blood samples from 12 breeding females and 11 breeding males both at the onset and at the end of the breeding season and from 12 adult daughters and 11 adult sons that did not reproduce at the end of the breeding season. Health was assessed using serum biochemistry analysis with VetScan Abaxis. Breeders differed considerably in their health before and after reproduction, particularly in parameters associated with digestion (lower amylase in males), metabolism (lower albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and glucose), osmoregulation (lower potassium and phosphorous in females) and immunity (higher globulin and altered alanine aminotransferase).

This sex-specific function of QMP may have evolved from a sexually dimorphic signaling mechanism derived from pre-social ancestors. If so, there is potential for pre-social insects to respond to QMP, and in a manner that is comparable to its normal effect on workers and drones. Remarkably, QMP applied to female Drosophila does induce worker-like qualities [Camiletti et al. (Entomol Exp Appl 147:262, 2013)], and we here extend this comparison to examine the effects of bee pheromone on male fruit flies. We find that male Drosophila melanogaster consistently orient towards a source of queen pheromone in a T-maze, suggesting a recruitment response comparable to the pheromone’s normal effect on drones. Moreover, exposure to QMP renders male flies more sexually attentive; they display intensified pre-copulatory behavior towards conspecific females. We can inhibit this sexual effect through a loss-of-olfactory-function mutation, which suggests that the pheromone-responsive behavioral mechanism is olfactory-driven. These pheromone-induced changes to male Drosophila behavior suggest that aspects of sexual signaling are conserved between these two distantly related taxa. Our results highlight a role for Drosophila as a genetically tractable pre-social model for studies of social insect biology.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Consequently, nectar-feeding birds are challenged not only by frequent water excess, but also by the toxin content of their diet. High water turnover, however, could be advantageous to nectar consumers by enabling them to excrete secondary metabolites or their transformation products more easily. We investigated how the alkaloid nicotine, naturally present in nectar of Nicotiana species, influences osmoregulation in white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens. We also examined the metabolic fate of nicotine in these two species to shed more light on the post-ingestive mechanisms that allow nectar-feeding birds to tolerate nectar nicotine. A high concentration of nicotine (50 µM) decreased cloacal fluid output and increased its osmolality in both species, due to reduced food intake that led to dehydration. White-eyes excreted a higher proportion of the ingested nicotine-containing diet than sunbirds. However, sugar concentration did not affect nicotine detoxification and elimination. Both species metabolised nicotine, excreting very little unchanged nicotine. Cape white-eyes mainly metabolised nicotine through the cotinine metabolic pathway, with norcotinine being the most abundant metabolite in the excreta, while white-bellied sunbirds excreted mainly nornicotine. Both species also utilized phase II conjugation reactions to detoxify nicotine, with Cape white-eyes depending more on the mercapturic acid pathway to detoxify nicotine than white-bellied sunbirds. We found that sunbirds and white-eyes, despite having a similar nicotine tolerance, responded differently and used different nicotine-derived metabolites to excrete nicotine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we tested the hypothesis that hibernation also reduces damage to ground squirrel livers in an in vivo, warm IR model, which more closely resembles complications associated with traumatic injury or surgical interventions. We also examined whether protection is mediated by two metabolites, inosine and biliverdin, that are elevated in ground squirrel liver during interbout arousals. Active squirrels in spring and hibernators during natural arousals to euthermia (body temperature 37 °C) were subject to liver IR or sham treatments. A subset of hibernating squirrels was pre-treated with compounds that inhibit inosine synthesis/signaling or biliverdin production. This model of liver IR successfully induced hepatocellular damage as indicated by increased plasma liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and hepatocyte apoptosis index compared to sham in both seasons, with greater elevations in spring squirrels. In addition, liver congestion increased after IR to a similar degree in spring and hibernating groups. Microvesicular steatosis was not affected by IR within the same season but was greater in sham squirrels in both seasons. Plasma IL-6 increased ~twofold in hibernators pre-treated with a biliverdin synthesis inhibitor (SnPP) prior to IR, but was not altered by IR in untreated squirrels. The results show that hibernation provides protection to ground squirrel livers subject to warm IR.

We know that dormice are nocturnal, arboreal, and avoid crossing open spaces between habitats, yet how they navigate around their canopy is unknown. As other rodents use whisker touch sensing to navigate and explore their environment, this study investigates whether Hazel dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) employ their whiskers to cross between habitats. We analysed high-speed video footage of dormice exploring freely in flat and climbing arenas in near darkness and using infrared light illumination. We confirm that, like rats and mice, dormice move their whiskers back and forth continuously (~10 Hz) in a motion called whisking and recruit them to explore small gaps (<10 cm) by increasing the amplitude and frequency of whisking and also the asymmetry of movement between the left and right whisker fields. When gaps between platforms are larger than 10–15 cm, dormice spend more time travelling on the floor. These findings suggest that dormice can actively and purposively move their whiskers to gather relevant information from their canopy at night. As this species is vulnerable to threats on the ground, we also provide evidence that joining habitat patches between dormouse populations is important for promoting natural behaviours and movement between patches.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we report identification of 132 ORs in the genome of A. glabripennis (inclusive of one Orco gene and 11 pseudogenes), some of which are orthologous to known pheromone receptors of other cerambycid beetles. We also identified three ORs that are strongly biased toward expression in the female transcriptome, and a single OR strongly biased toward males. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the antennal lobes of adults suggested a male-specific macroglomerulus and several enlarged glomeruli in females. We predict that functional characterization of ORs and glomeruli will lead to identification of key odorants in the life history of A. glabripennis that may aid in monitoring and controlling future invasions.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Studies aimed at quantifying plasticity often focus on one challenge, such as diet, and one organ system, such the gastrointestinal tract, but this approach may not adequately reflect how plasticity could buffer multiple challenges. Thus, we investigated the outcomes of a dual challenge experiment that fed land snails either a high-fibre (low quality) or a low-fibre (high quality) diet, and simultaneously exercised them daily over 1.2 m on either a smooth surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a rough sandpaper. By the end of 20 days, snails fed the poor quality diet had a longer crop and oesophagus and a heavier intestine and rectum than those offered a low-fibre diet. Additionally, high-fibre fed snails had a smaller spermoviduct and oviduct. When also exercised on sandpaper, high-fibre fed snails had a smaller digestive gland, a main energy store, than those exercised on PVC. All snails exercised on sandpaper had a heavier pedal mucus gland, used a loping gait and used less mucus than those on PVC plastic, but there was no difference in the average speed of snails on either surface, supporting the conclusion that loping is a mucus conserving gait. Notably, snails faced with both a diet and substrate challenge had a smaller kidney, which could directly effect fecundity. This demonstrates that our dual challenge approach has potential for evaluating the costs and limits of the plasticity necessary to fully appreciate the evolutionary significance of plasticity in snails and other species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Several studies have revealed the sensitivity of this response to frequency and contrast, but we know less about the spatial integration underlying this response. Specifically, few studies have investigated how the horizontal angular extent of stimuli influences the optomotor response. We presented mantises with moving gratings of varying horizontal extents at three different contrasts in the central or peripheral regions of their visual fields. We assessed the relative effectivity of different regions to elicit the optomotor response and modelled the dependency of the response on the angular extent subtended by stimuli at these different regions. Our results show that the optomotor response is governed by stimuli in the central visual field and not in the periphery. The model also shows that in the central region, the probability of response increases linearly with increase in horizontal extent up to a saturation point. Furthermore, the dependency of the optomotor response on the angular extent of the stimulus is modulated by contrast.

However, these fluctuations in body mass do not cause the same harmful effects associated with obesity in humans. To better understand these seasonal transitions, we performed insulin and glucose tolerance tests in captive grizzly bears, characterized the annual profiles of circulating adipokines, and tested the anorectic effects of centrally administered leptin at different times of the year. We also used bear gluteal adipocyte cultures to test insulin and beta-adrenergic sensitivity in vitro. Bears were insulin resistant during hibernation but were sensitive during the spring and fall active periods. Hibernating bears remained euglycemic, possibly due to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia. Adipokine concentrations were relatively low throughout the active season but peaked in mid-October prior to hibernation when fat content was greatest. Serum glycerol was highest during hibernation, indicating ongoing lipolysis. Centrally administered leptin reduced food intake in October, but not in August, revealing seasonal variation in the brain’s sensitivity to its anorectic effects. This was supported by strong phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 labeling within the hypothalamus of hibernating bears; labeling virtually disappeared in active bears.

Mutant mice are much smaller in size than their siblings and gait abnormalities may be driven by differences in limb proportions and/or by changes to muscle phenotype caused by the titin mutation. We quantified differences in walking gait among mdm genotypes and also determined whether genotypes vary in limb morphometrics. Mice were filmed walking, and kinematic and morphological variables were measured. Mutant mice had a smaller range of motion at the ankle, shorter stride lengths, and shorter stance duration, but walked at the same relative speeds as the other genotypes. Although phenotypically similar to wildtype mice, heterozygous mice frequently exhibited intermediate gait mechanics.

Although low frictional damping in flight is the key to the extraordinary aerial performance and agility of flying birds, bats and insects, it challenges these animals with extraordinary demands on sensory integration and motor precision. Our review focuses on the dynamic precision with which Drosophila activates its flight muscular system during maneuvering flight, considering relevant studies on neural and muscular mechanisms of thoracic propulsion. In particular, we tackle the precision with which flies adjust power output of asynchronous power muscles and synchronous flight control muscles by monitoring muscle calcium and spike timing within the stroke cycle.

Yet, knowledge of the capacity of marine calcifiers to undergo metabolic adaptation is sparse. In Kiel Fjord, blue mussels thrive despite periodically high seawater PCO2, making this population interesting for studying metabolic adaptation under OA. Consequently, we conducted a multi-generation experiment and compared physiological responses of F1 mussels from ‘tolerant’ and ‘sensitive’ families exposed to OA for 1 year. Family classifications were based on larval survival; tolerant families settled at all PCO2 levels (700, 1120, 2400 µatm) while sensitive families did not settle at the highest PCO2 (≥99.8% mortality). We found similar filtration rates between family types at the control and intermediate PCO2 level. However, at 2400 µatm, filtration and metabolic scope of gill tissue decreased in tolerant families, indicating functional limitations at the tissue level. Routine metabolic rates (RMR) and summed tissue respiration (gill and outer mantle tissue) of tolerant families were increased at intermediate PCO2, indicating elevated cellular homeostatic costs in various tissues. By contrast, OA did not affect tissue and routine metabolism of sensitive families. However, tolerant mussels were characterised by lower RMR at control PCO2 than sensitive families, which had variable RMR. This might provide the energetic scope to cover increased energetic demands under OA, highlighting the importance of analysing intra-population variability.

The final output of this regulatory process is circadian pattern of steroidogenic genes expression and testosterone production. Aging gradually decreases robustness of rhythmic testosterone secretion without change in pattern of LH secretion. Here, we analyzed effect of aging on circadian variation of cAMP and cGMP signaling in Leydig cells. Results showed opposite effect of aging on cAMP and cGMP daily variation. Reduced amplitude of cAMP circadian oscillation was probably associated with changed expression of genes involved in cAMP production (increased circadian pattern of Adcy7, Adcy9, Adcy10 and decreased Adcy3); cAMP degradation (increased Pde4a, decreased Pde8b, canceled rhythm of Pde4d, completely reversed circadian pattern of Pde7b and Pde8a); and circadian expression of protein kinase A subunits (Prkac/PRKAC and Prkar2a). Aging stimulates expression of genes responsible for cGMP production (Nos2, Gucy1a3 and Gucy1b3/GUCYB3) and degradation (Pde5a, Pde6a and Pde6h) but the overall net effect is elevation of cGMP circadian oscillations in Leydig cells. In addition, the expression of cGMP-dependent kinase, Prkg1/PRKG1 is up-regulated. It seems that aging potentiate cGMP- and reduce cAMP-signaling in Leydig cells.

This study tests whether marsh frogs could determine migratory direction between the breeding pond and the wintering site by magnetic cues in the laboratory. Adult frogs (N = 32) were individually tested in the T-maze 127 cm long inside the three-axis Helmholtz coil system (diameter 3 m). The arms of the maze were positioned parallel to the natural migratory route of this population when measured in accordance with magnetic field. The frogs were tested under two-motivational conditions mediated by temperature/light regime: the breeding migratory state and the wintering state. The frogs’ choice in a T-maze was evident only when analyzed in accordance with the direction of the magnetic field: they moved along the migratory route to the breeding pond and followed the reversion of the horizontal component of the magnetic field. This preference has been detected in both sexes only in the breeding migratory state. This suggests that adult ranid frogs can obtain directional information from the Earth’s magnetic field as was shown earlier in urodeles and anuran larvae.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we experimentally analysed the flight path of the phonotaxis from a landmark to the target, a hidden loudspeaker in the field. During flight, the fly showed only small lateral deviations. The vertical flight direction angles were initially negative (directed downwards relative to starting position), grew positive (directed upwards) in the second half of the flight, and finally flattened (directed horizontally or slightly upwards), typically resulting in a landing above the loudspeaker. This phonotactic flight pattern was largely independent from sound pressure level or target distance, but depended on the elevation of the sound source. The flight velocity was partially influenced by sound pressure level and distance, but also by elevation. The more elevated the target, the lower was the speed. The accuracy of flight increased with elevation of the target as well as the landing precision. The minimal vertical angle difference eliciting differences in behaviour was 10°. By changing the elevation of the acoustic target after take-off, we showed that the fly is able to orientate acoustically while flying.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The facet lens reflectance spectra are associated with a spectrally restricted, reduced transmittance, which causes modified spectral sensitivities of the underlying photoreceptors. Based on the modeling and electroretinography of the dolichopodid Condylostylus japonicus we conjecture that the green and orange facets narrow the spectral bandwidths of blue and green central photoreceptors, respectively, thus possibly improving color and/or polarization vision.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Small mammalian hibernators and cold-hardy insects are examples of natural models of cold adaptation that have been amply explored. While the molecular picture associated with cold adaptation has started to become clearer in recent years, notably through the use of high-throughput experimental approaches, the underlying cold-associated functions attributed to several non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), remain to be better characterized. Nevertheless, key pioneering work has provided clues on the likely relevance of these molecules in cold adaptation. With an emphasis on mammalian hibernation and insect cold hardiness, this work first reviews various molecular changes documented so far in these processes. The cascades leading to miRNA and lncRNA production as well as the mechanisms of action of these non-coding RNAs are subsequently described. Finally, we present examples of differentially expressed non-coding RNAs in models of cold adaptation and elaborate on the potential significance of this modulation with respect to low-temperature adaptation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

High temporal resolution has been described in three species of passerines but it is unknown whether this is specific to passerines, to small actively flying birds, to insectivores or to birds living in bright habitats. Temporal resolution of vision is commonly tested by determining the flicker fusion frequency (FFF), at which the eye can no longer distinguish a flickering light from a constant light of equal intensity at different luminances. Using a food reward, we trained the birds to discriminate a constant light from a flickering light, at four different luminances between 750 and 7500 cd/m2. The highest FFF found in one bird at 3500 cd/m2 was 93 Hz. Three birds had higher FFF (82 Hz) at 7500 cd/m2 than at 3500 cd/m2. Six human subjects had lower FFF than the birds at 1500 but similar FFF at 750 cd/m2.

This phenomenon reflects the interplay of both diet and physiology. Though the accrual of fat stores is known to be essential for overwintering in some species, the influence of diet on the physiology of torpor is not fully understood. Results from captive studies in heterothermic rodents and marsupials have indicated that when autumn diets are enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), animals receiving these diets experience deeper and more frequent torpor bouts than their counterparts receiving a control diet. Our study investigates this potential effect of dietary composition in animals that use daily torpor rather than prolonged torpor (i.e., hibernation). In so doing, we investigate the degree to which dietary effects on torpor are restricted to cold-adapted rodents and marsupials, or are a more general feature of mammalian heterothermy. We examined the effects of a PUFA diet and a control diet on the thermoregulation of one of the few species of primates known to use daily torpor: the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Though the results of this study are largely inconclusive regarding the impact of dietary manipulations on torpor frequency and duration, we nonetheless find that the propensity of animals to enter torpor is directly influenced by age and seasonal changes in body mass, and thus reflect important physiological aspects of flexible thermoregulatory responses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, five hooded seal pups had ad lib access to snow and seawater for the first 12 and last 21 days of their post-weaning fast, respectively. Total body water and water flux were determined during both exposure periods by use of the tritiated water method. Blood samples were collected to monitor changes in hematocrit, plasma urea and plasma osmolality. Body mass loss was on average 0.36 kg day−1. Average total body water changed from 15.7 to 11.4 L, while total water influx changed from 15 to 18 mL day−1 kg−1 during snow and seawater exposure, respectively. Of this influx an average of 35% can be attributed to metabolic water, while approximately 8% was due to respiratory water influx. Interestingly, 56 and 58% of the total water influx was due to snow and seawater ingestion, respectively, amounting to 8 mL day−1 kg−1 snow (counted as liquid water) and 10 mL day−1 kg−1 seawater. Based on the results of the plasma parameters it is concluded that fasting hooded seal pups maintain water balance and homeostasis when access to snow or seawater is permitted. It is further concluded that snow and seawater intake, in addition to metabolic and respiratory water, is important for maintenance of water balance and excretion of urea during the post-weaning fast of hooded seal pups.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated the physiological responses of Rufous-cheeked nightjars (Caprimulgus rufigena) and Freckled nightjars (Caprimulgus tristigma) to high air temperatures (Ta) by measuring body temperature (Tb), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) at Ta ranging from 10 to 56 °C. Both species became hyperthermic at Ta > Tb. Lower critical limits of thermoneutrality occurred at Ta between 35 and 37 °C, whereas we detected no clear upper critical limits of thermoneutrality. Between Ta ≈ 37.0 and 39.9 °C, rates of TEWL increased rapidly with Ta. At Ta ≥ 40 °C, fractional increases in mass-specific TEWL rates were 78–106% of allometric predictions. Increasing evaporative heat dissipation incurred only small metabolic costs, with the RMR of neither species ever increasing by more than 20% above thermoneutral values. Consequently, both species displayed extremely efficient evaporative cooling; maximum evaporative heat dissipation was equivalent to 515% of metabolic heat production (MHP) at Ta ≈ 56 °C in C. rufigena and 452% of MHP at Ta ≈ 52 °C in C. tristigma. Our data reiterate that caprimulgids have evolved an efficient mechanism of evaporative cooling via gular fluttering, which minimizes metabolic heat production at high Ta and reduces total heat loads.

Depth and duration of foraging dives are a function of total available oxygen stores, which theoretically increase as animals grow, and metabolic costs. To evaluate how physiology may influence the travelling costs for seals to foraging patches in the wild, we measured metabolic rates of a cross-section of New Zealand fur seals, Australian fur seals and Australian sea lions representing different foraging strategies, development stages, sexes and sizes. We report values for standard metabolic rate, active metabolic rate (obtained from submerged swimming), along with estimates of cost of transport (COT), measured via respirometry. We found a decline in mass-specific metabolic rate with increased duration of submerged swimming. For most seals mass-specific metabolic rate increased with speed and for all seals mass-specific COT decreased with speed. Mass-specific metabolic rate was higher for subadult than adult fur seals and sea lions, corresponding to an overall higher minimum COT. Some sex differences were also apparent, such that female Australian fur seals and Australian sea lions had higher mass-specific metabolic rates than males. There were no species differences in standard or active metabolic rates for adult males or females. The seals in our study appear to operate at their physiological optimum during submerged swimming. However, the higher metabolic rates of young and female fur seals and sea lions may limit their scope for increasing foraging effort during times of resource limitation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Some is reflected back to the environment, while another portion is reflected further into the coat where it is absorbed and manifested as heat at differing levels. Substantial insulation in a coat limits the thermal impact at the skin of solar radiation, irrespective where in the coat it is absorbed. In coats with low insulation, the zone where solar radiation is absorbed may govern the consequent heat load on the skin (HL-SR). Thin summer furs of four species of kangaroo from differing climatic zones were used to determine how variation in insulation and in coat spectral and structural characteristics influence the HL-SR. Coat depth, structure, and solar reflectance varied between body regions, as well as between species. The modulation of solar radiation and resultant heat flows in these coats were measured at low (1 m s−1) and high (6 m s−1) wind speeds by mounting them on a heat flux transducer/temperature-controlled plate apparatus in a wind tunnel. A lamp with a spectrum similar to solar radiation was used as a proxy for the sun. We established that coat insulation was largely determined by coat depth at natural fur lie, despite large variations in fibre density, fibre diameter, and fur mass. Higher wind speed decreased coat insulation, but depth still determined the overall level. A multiple regression analysis that included coat depth (insulation), fibre diameter, fibre density, and solar reflectance was used to determine the best predictors of HL-SR. Only depth and reflectance had significant impacts and both factors had negative weights, so, as either insulation or reflectance increased, HL-SR declined, the larger impact coming from coat reflectance. This reverses the pattern observed in deep coats where insulation dominates over effects of reflectance. Across all coats, as insulation declined, reflectance increased. An increase in reflectance in the thinnest coats was not the sole reason for the limited rise in HL-SR. Higher reflectance should increase the depth of penetrance of solar radiation, thus increasing HL-SR. But in M. antilopinus and Macropus rufus, which had the highest of coat reflectances, penetrance was relatively shallow. This effect appears due to high fibre density (M. rufus) and major modifications in the fibre structure (M. antilopinus). The differing adaptations likely relate to the habitats of these species, desert in the case of M. rufus and monsoon tropical woodland with M. antilopinus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated how variation in the levels of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc), glycogen phosphorylase (GP), and glycogen synthase (GS) relates to seasonal glycogen cycling in a temperate (Ohioan) and subarctic (Alaskan) populations of this species. In spring, Ohioan frogs had reduced potential for glycogen synthesis, as evidenced by low GS activity and high PKAc protein levels. In addition, glycogen levels in spring were the lowest of four seasonal samples, as energy input was likely directed towards metabolism and somatic growth during this period. Near-maximal glycogen levels were reached by mid-summer, and remained unchanged in fall and winter, suggesting that glycogenesis was curtailed during this period. Ohioan frogs had a high potential for glycogenolysis and glycogenesis in winter, as evidenced by large glycogen reserves, high levels of GP and GS proteins, and high GS activity, which likely allows for rapid mobilization of cryoprotectant during freezing and replenishing of glycogen reserves during thawing. Alaskan frogs also achieved a near-maximal liver glycogen concentration by summer and displayed high glycogenic and glycogenolytic potential in winter, but, unlike Ohioan frogs, started replenishing their energy reserves early in spring. We conclude that variation in levels of both glycogenolytic and glycogenic enzymes likely happens in response to seasonal changes in energetic strategies and demands, with winter survival being a key component to understanding the regulation of glycogen cycling in this species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Changes of Hb expression under hypoxia, together with the investigations of spleen somatic index, kidney somatic index and Hb concentration in circulation, suggest that the kidney may not only serve as the erythropoietic organ, but also act as the major blood reservoir in S. pylzovi. From this perspective, the transcriptional activity of Hb in S. pylzovi, as reflected in the kidney, was turned down quickly after the onset of severe hypoxia, while under moderate hypoxia the transcriptional activity of Hb showed upregulation for a short time, but then the transcriptional machinery was turned down slowly on prolonged exposure. Notably, the changes in Hb protein levels in spleen, liver and kidney in response to severe and moderate hypoxia were not in line with the changes in mRNA levels, which are related with the blood reservoir in the kidney.

In particular, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is focussed, which has long been used as a model species for studying photoperiodism. Photoperiodism is established by several physiological modules, such as the photoreceptor, photoperiodic time measurement system, counter system, and endocrine effector. It is now clear that retinal photoreception through the ocelli is indispensable for the function of photoperiodism, at least in T. urticae. Visual pigment, which comprised opsin protein and a vitamin A-based pigment, is involved in photoreception. The physiological basis of the photoperiodic time measurement system is still under debate, and we have controversial evidence for the hourglass-based time measurement and the oscillator-based time measurement.

While thermal acclimation can buffer the direct thermal effects on basal cardiorespiratory function during chronic warming, little is known about how acclimation affects stress-induced cardiorespiratory responses. We compared cardiovascular and haematological responses to chasing stress in cannulated wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) from a reference area at natural temperature (16 °C) with perch from the ‘Biotest enclosure’; an experimental system chronically warmed (22 °C) by effluents from a nuclear power plant. Routine blood pressure was similar, but Biotest perch had slightly higher resting heart rate (59.9 ± 2.8 vs 51.3 ± 2.9 beats min−1), although the Q10 for heart rate was 1.3, indicating pronounced thermal compensation. Chasing stress caused hypertension and a delayed tachycardia in both groups, but the maximum heart rate increase was 2.5-fold greater in Biotest fish (43.3 ± 4.3 vs 16.9 ± 2.7 beats min−1). Moreover, the pulse pressure response after stress was greater in reference fish, possibly due to the less pronounced tachycardia or a greater ventricular pressure generating capacity and thermally mediated differences in aortic compliance. Baseline haematological status was also similar, but after chasing stress, the haematocrit was higher in Biotest fish due to exacerbated red blood cell swelling. This study highlights that while eurythermal fishes can greatly compensate routine cardiorespiratory functions through acclimation processes, stress-induced responses may still differ markedly.

In the chronic treatment, OEA impairs the increase in body mass and reduces locomotor activity, without any signs of stress. The lipolytic capacity in liver decreased after both acute and chronic OEA treatments, whereas lipogenic capacity increased after acute and decreased after chronic treatment with OEA. These results are different from those observed to date in mammalian adipose tissue, but not so different from those known in liver, and might be attributed to the absence of changes in the expression of pparα, and/or to the increase in the expression of the clock gene bmal1a after chronic OEA treatment. As for glucose metabolism, a clear decrease in the capacity of hepatic tissue to use glucose was observed in OEA-treated fish. These results support an important role for OEA in the regulation of liver lipid and glucose metabolism, and could relate to the metabolic changes associated with circadian activity and the regulation of food intake in fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Winter-acclimatized fish were exposed to anoxia for 1, 3, or 6 weeks at 2 °C, and changes in the size of glycogen deposits were followed. After 1 week of anoxia, a major part of the glycogen stores was mobilized in liver (79.5 %) and heart (75.6 %), and large decreases occurred in gill (46.7 %) and muscle (45.1 %). Brain was an exception in that its glycogen content remained unchanged. The amount of glycogen degraded during the first anoxic week was sufficient for the anaerobic ethanol production for more than 6 weeks of anoxia. After 3 and 6 weeks of anoxia, there was little further degradation of glycogen in other tissues except the brain where the stores were reduced by 30.1 and 49.9 % after 3 and 6 weeks of anoxia, respectively. One week of normoxic recovery following the 6-week anoxia was associated with a complete replenishment of the brain glycogen and partial recovery of liver, heart, and gill glycogen stores. Notably, the resynthesis of glycogen occurred at the expense of the existing energy reserves of the body in fasting fish. These findings indicate that in crucian carp, glycogen stores are quickly mobilized after the onset of anoxia, with the exception of the brain whose glycogen stores may be saved for putative emergency situations.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, while the influence of the sun feels omnipotent to surface dwellers such as ourselves, life on earth is dominated, in terms of biomass, by organisms isolated from the direct effects of the sun. A limited understanding of what life is like away from the sun can be inferred from our knowledge of physiology and ecology in the light biosphere, but a full understanding can only be gained by studying animals from the dark biosphere, both in the laboratory and in their natural habitats. One of the least understood aspects of life in the dark biosphere is the rhythmicity of physiology and what it means to live in an environment of low or no rhythmicity. Here we describe methods that may be used to understand rhythmic physiology in the dark and summarise some of the studies of rhythmic physiology in “arrhythmic” environments, such as the poles, deep sea and caves. We review what can be understood about the adaptive value of rhythmic physiology on the Earth’s surface from studies of animals from arrhythmic environments and what role a circadian clock may play in the dark.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A focus was put on the comparative hearing sensitivity at low frequencies. Low- and mid-frequency thresholds appeared to be elevated in both captive and free-ranging seals, but this is likely due to masking effects and limitations of the methodology used. The data also showed individual variability in hearing sensitivity with probable age-related hearing loss found in two old harbour seals. These results suggest that the acoustic sensitivity of free-ranging animals was not negatively affected by the soundscape they experienced in the wild.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In fish, higher VV(mit,f) is typically associated with increased expression of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), a transcription factor that induces expression of nuclear-encoded respiratory genes. To examine if nrf1 expression or the expression of other genes that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis contribute to changes in whole-organism metabolic rate during cold acclimation, we examined the time course of changes in the expression of these genes and in metabolic rate in Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Cold acclimation rapidly decreased metabolic rate, but increased the expression of nrf1 more gradually, with a time course that depended on how rapidly the fish were transitioned to low temperature. Cold-induced nrf1 expression was not associated with increases in biochemical indicators of mitochondrial respiratory capacity, suggesting that cold-induced mitochondrial biogenesis may occur without increases in oxidative capacity in this species. These observations imply that changes in nrf1 expression and metabolic rate due to cold acclimation occur through different physiological mechanisms, and that increases in VV(mit,f) are likely not directly related to changes in metabolic rate with cold acclimation in this species. However, nrf1 expression differed between northern and southern killifish subspecies regardless of acclimation temperature, consistent with observed differences in metabolic rate and VV(mit,f) at 5 °C between these subspecies. Taken together, these results reveal substantial complexity in the regulation of VV(mit,f) and mitochondrial capacity with temperature in fish and the relationship of these parameters to metabolic rate.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Using a shuttle box with a two-chamber unmixed laminar flow that allowed fish to remain or flee from a chemical cue, we showed that the avoidance response depended on the type of the chemical cue. We show that zebrafish (Danio rerio) retreated from water conditioned with chemical cues released by chemically or physically stressed fish and acutely fasted fish, but not from water with cues from fish experiencing visual contact with predatory fish or fish suffering from chronic food restriction.

Sharing these characteristics, salamanders could be models for the carryover of auditory function across an aquatic–terrestrial boundary without tympanic middle ears. We measured amphibious auditory evoked potential audiograms in five phylogenetically and ecologically distinct salamanders (Amphiuma means, Notophthalmus viridescens, Ambystoma talpoideum, Eurycea spp., and Plethodon glutinosus) and tested whether metamorphosis and terrestrial niche were linked to aerial sensitivity. Threshold differences between media varied between species. A. means’ relative aerial sensitivity was greatest at 100 Hz and decreased with increasing frequency. In contrast, all other salamanders retained greater sensitivity up to 500 Hz, and in A. talpoideum and Eurycea, relative sensitivity at 500 Hz was higher than at 100 Hz. Aerial thresholds of terrestrial P. glutinosus above 200 Hz were similar to A. talpoideum and Eurycea, but lower than N. viridescens and A. means. Metamorphosis did not affect aerial sensitivity in N. viridescens or A. talpoideum. These results fail to support a hypothesis of terrestrial hearing specialization across ontogeny or phylogeny.

The tracks were analysed by time lag embedding to calculate the short-term correlation dimension, a variable that reflects the degrees of freedom and thus the number of factors involved in a system. We found that higher natural fluctuations in the earth’s magnetic field characterized by AP-indices of 8 and above caused a reduction of the correlation dimension of the control birds. We thus separated the data into two groups according to whether they were recorded on magnetically quiet days or on days with higher magnetic fluctuations. Anaesthetizing the upper beak had no significant effect. Making pigeons anosmic reduced the correlation dimension on magnetically quiet days, but did not cause any reduction on days with higher fluctuations. Altogether, our data suggest an involvement of magnetic cues and olfactory factors during the homing flight and point to a robust, multi-factorial map.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We investigated thermal tolerance traits (critical thermal limits and metabolic response to temperature) to gain knowledge about physiological adaptations to their local climate conditions and to get evidence for the reasons of P. dominula’s successful dispersion. Body and ambient temperature measurements at the nests revealed behavioural adaptations to microclimate. The species differed clearly in critical thermal minimum (P. dominula −1.4 °C, P. gallicus −0.4 °C), but not significantly in critical thermal maximum of activity (P. dominula 47.1 °C, P. gallicus 47.6 °C). The metabolic response did not reveal clear adaptations to climate conditions. At low and high temperatures, the metabolic rate of P. dominula was higher, and at intermediate temperatures, we determined higher values in P. gallicus. However, the species exhibited remarkably differing thermoregulatory behaviour at the nest. On average, P. gallicus tolerated a thoracic temperature up to ~41 °C, whereas P. dominula already tried at ~37 °C to keep the thorax below ambient temperature. We suggest this to be an adaptation to the higher mean ambient temperature we measured at the nest during a breeding season. Although we determined for P. dominula a 0.5 °C larger thermal tolerance range, we do not presume this parameter to be solely responsible for the successful distribution of P. dominula. Additional factors, such as the thermal tolerance of the queens could limit the overwintering success of P. gallicus in a harsher climate.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Their unique morphology allows them to live buried in the sediment at depths of up to 1 m. The endemic New Zealand geoduck (Panopea zelandica Quoy and Gaimard, 1835) has recently been identified as a potential species for aquaculture. However, very little is known about the biology and physiology of this entirely subtidal geoduck species. Currently, the New Zealand geoduck fishery relies entirely upon wild harvests, but farms are expected to emerge as cultivation protocols are established. A key step in the optimization of cultivation procedures is the identification of optimal temperature and food rations. One method for establishing thermal optima is to identify the temperature window that supports the widest aerobic scope: the degree to which metabolic rate can be increased to support elevated activity demands. Thus, we investigated the aerobic scope for activity at five different temperatures representative of typical environmental conditions (8, 11, 15, 19, and 23 °C) for juvenile and young adult P. zelandica. Clearance rate was also measured at all temperatures. Comparisons of aerobic scope for activity and clearance rates between size classes revealed that juvenile geoducks had a narrower thermal optimum than young adults (15–19 versus 11–19 °C, respectively). Temperatures higher than 19 °C resulted in a reduction of aerobic scope for activity and clearance rate for both juvenile and young adults, which may lead to reduced performance and elevated mortality. These findings provide the first measures of aerobic scope in P. zelandica, a key step towards a meaningful understanding of the ecophysiology of this unusual species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

As knowledge about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was less common and torpor expression was substantially higher (≥2-fold) at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded, which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure typically is increased.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Our discovery of VEGF111 in the uterus of both a eutherian (rat) and a marsupial (fat-tailed dunnart) suggests that the splice variant may be common to all mammals. As VEGF111 is also expressed in the uterus of at least one lineage of lizards, the expression of this splice variant may be a widespread amniote phenomenon. We measured expression of VEGF111 and two major VEGF-A splice variants in the uterus of pregnant rats, showing that the three variants show different expression patterns across pregnancy. Our results suggest that viviparous mammals possess a precisely regulated milieu of VEGF isoforms producing the angiogenesis required for successful pregnancy. The discovery of VEGF111 in rat uterus paves the way for the development of in vivo models of VEGF111 activity in a highly tractable laboratory animal, and is particularly significant in the context of early pregnancy loss and cancer research.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Therefore, the long-term selected polygenic mouse line DUhTP originally established in Dummerstorf for high treadmill performance is used. DUhTP mice are characterized by increased fat accumulation in the sedentary condition and elevated fat mobilization during mild voluntary physical activity. In the present study, the phenotype of fat cell browning of subcutaneous fat and a potential effect on oral glucose tolerance, an indicator of metabolic health, were addressed in DUhTP mice. Analysis of peripheral fat pads revealed increased brite (brown-in-white) subcutaneous adipose tissues and in subcutaneous fat from DUhTP mice higher levels of irisin and different markers of fat cell browning like T-box transcription factor (Tbx1), PPARα, and uncoupling protein (UCP1) (P < 0.05) when compared to unselected controls. UCP1 was further increased in subcutaneous fat from DUhTP mice in response to mild exercise (fourfold, P < 0.05). In addition, surface temperature of DUhTP mice was increased when compared to controls indicating a physiological effect of increased UCP1 expression. The present study suggests that DUhTP mice exhibit different markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and fat browning without external stimuli. At an age of 43 days, sedentary DUhTP mice have improved metabolic health as judged from lower levels of blood glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test.

Studies in passerine birds and some commercial poultry demonstrate that the gastrointestinal tract can respond to varying diet composition and quality by changing morphology and/or activities of digestive enzymes. However, studies in additional avian species are warranted to understand generalities of these trends. We first fed juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), chickens (Gallus gallus), and quails (Coturnix coturnix) on either high-carbohydrate or high-protein diets. For the most part, birds fed the high-carbohydrate diet had higher small intestinal and cecal disaccharidase activities (maltase and sucrase). However, only mallards exhibited higher small intestinal aminopeptidase-N (APN) activities when fed the high-protein diet. These results differ from passerine birds, which largely modulate small intestinal proteases, but not disaccharidases. In another trial, we fed Canada geese (Branta canadensis) diets that varied in both their protein and fiber concentrations for approximately 3.5 months. Birds fed the high-fiber diets had significantly longer small intestines and caeca compared to those fed low-fiber diets. Additionally, geese fed the high-fiber diets exhibited lower mass-specific activities of small intestinal sucrase, and higher activities of APN when summed across the small intestine and ceca. Similar to the avian species above, geese fed the high-protein diets did not exhibit flexibility in their small intestinal APN activities. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that responsiveness of the avian digestive tract to diet composition may have phylogenetic or ecological constraints.

However, it has been difficult to undertake the requisite controlled studies to determine the physiological limitations and trade-offs that marine mammals face while diving in the wild under varying environmental and nutritional conditions. For the past decade, Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) trained to swim and dive in the open ocean away from the physical confines of pools participated in studies that investigated the interactions between diving behaviour, energetic costs, physiological constraints, and prey availability. Many of these studies measured the cost of diving to understand how it varies with behaviour and environmental and physiological conditions. Collectively, these studies show that the type of diving (dive bouts or single dives), the level of underwater activity, the depth and duration of dives, and the nutritional status and physical condition of the animal affect the cost of diving and foraging. They show that dive depth, dive and surface duration, and the type of dive result in physiological adjustments (heart rate, gas exchange) that may be independent of energy expenditure. They also demonstrate that changes in prey abundance and nutritional status cause sea lions to alter the balance between time spent at the surface acquiring oxygen (and offloading CO2 and other metabolic by-products) and time spent at depth acquiring prey. These new insights into the physiological basis of diving behaviour further our understanding of the potential scope for behavioural responses of marine mammals to environmental changes, the energetic significance of these adjustments, and the consequences of approaching physiological limits.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Elasmobranch fishes are of special interest because of the morphological arrangement of their cardiomyocytes. Unlike teleosts, the majority of the ventricular myocardium in elasmobranch fishes is distant to the venous blood returning to the heart (i.e., the luminal blood). Also, the majority of the myocardium is in close association with the coronary circulation.

In the arctic teleost, navaga cod (Eleginus navaga), IKr and IK1 are strongly up-regulated in winter. The current study tests the hypothesis that the ligand-gated K+ current, the acetylcholine-activated inward rectifier, IKACh, is also modified by seasonal acclimatization in atrial myocytes of navaga. In sinoatrial preparations of the summer-acclimatized (SA) navaga, 10−6 M carbamylcholine chloride (CCh) caused slowing of heart rate, shortening of atrial action potential (AP) duration and a drastic reduction of AP amplitude, eventually resulting in inexcitability. In winter-acclimatized (WA) atria CCh slowed HR and reduced AP duration, but reduction of AP amplitude was modest and never resulted in inexcitability. The difference in cholinergic response between SA and WA navaga is explained by seasonal changes in IKACh density. The peak density of IKACh, induced by 10−5 M CCh, at the common experimental temperature (+6 °C) was 0.97 ± 0.28 pA/pF in SA navaga but only 0.183 ± 0.013 pA/pF in WA navaga (a 5.3-fold difference, P < 0.05).

Thus, acclimatization to summer induces a drastic up-regulation of the atrial IKACh, which effectively shortens atrial AP. The reverse temperature compensation of the atrial IKACh may be advantageous in summer under variable water temperatures and oxygen concentrations by reducing workload of the heart.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The instrument demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing the complete field of view of an insect eye in a fraction of the time required if using non-motorized, non-computerized methods. Faster eye mapping makes it practical for the first time to employ sample sizes appropriate for testing hypotheses about the visual significance of interspecific differences in regional specializations. Example maps of facet sizes are presented from four dipteran insects representing the Asilidae, Calliphoridae, and Stratiomyidae. These maps provide the first quantitative documentation of the frontal enlarged-facet zones (EFZs) that typify asilid eyes, which, together with the EFZs in male Calliphoridae, are likely to be correlated with high-spatial-resolution acute zones.

In many mammals, torpor is most often used opportunistically in response to decreased ambient temperature (Ta) and food availability, but information on how seasonally changing photoperiod per se influences torpor patterns is scant. Therefore, we quantified patterns of torpor use in response to natural photoperiod in captive marsupial pygmy-possums held at near-constant Ta with a stable food supply over a period of 19 months. Western pygmy-possums (Cercartetus concinnus) and eastern pygmy-possums (C. nanus) used spontaneous torpor in every month of the year; in total we measured >1100 individual torpor bouts. Torpor bout duration was >60 % longer in winter than in summer and increased with decreasing day length for both species. Interestingly, the duration of torpor appeared to be adjusted at both the beginning and end of bouts because the time of entry into and rewarming from torpor relative to sunrise and sunset, respectively, changed with season. We propose that this reflects a synchronisation of torpor timing with foraging periods in the wild, which would enable animals to maintain a high body mass year-round by maximising both energy savings via torpor and energy input via food consumption. Our study suggests that photoperiod makes a significant contribution to the seasonal change in torpor bout duration of small hibernating mammals that use torpor throughout the year.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Female crickets have to perceive and integrate male cues relevant for mate choice while confronted with several different signals in an acoustically diverse background. Overall female decisions are based on the attractiveness of the temporal pattern (informative about the ‘what’) and on signal intensity (informative about the ‘where’) of male calling songs. Here, we investigated how the relevant cues for mate choice are integrated during the decision process by females of five different species of chirping and trilling field crickets. Using a behavioral design, female preferences in no-choice and choice situations for male calling songs differing in pulse rate, modulation depth, intensities, chirp/trill arrangements and temporal shifts were examined. Sensory processing underlying decisions in female field crickets is rather similar as combined evidence suggested that incoming song patterns were analyzed separately by bilaterally paired networks for pattern attractiveness and pattern intensity. A downstream gain control mechanism leads to a weighting of the intensity cue by pattern attractiveness. While remarkable differences between species were observed with respect to specific processing steps, closely related species exhibited more similar preferences than did more distantly related species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Unfortunately, relatively minor stress to a neuron can cause extensive loss of this integrity. Axon degeneration is the cell-intrinsic program that actively deconstructs an axon after injury or damage. Although ultrastructural examination has revealed signs of axon degeneration in vivo, the occurrence and progression of axon degeneration in avian species have not yet been documented in vitro. Here, we use a novel cell culture system with primary embryonic zebra finch retinal ganglion cells to interrogate the properties of avian axon degeneration. First, we establish that both axotomy and a chemically induced injury (taxol and vincristine) are sufficient to initiate degeneration. These events are dependent on a late influx of calcium. In addition, as in mammals, the NAD pathway is involved, since a decrease in NMN with FK866 can reduce degeneration. Importantly, these retinal ganglion cell axons were sensitive to a pressure-induced injury, which may mimic the effect of high intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. We have demonstrated that avian neurons undergo Wallerian degeneration in response to both physical and chemical injury. Subsequent avian studies will investigate whether blocking the degeneration pathway can protect individuals from neurodegenerative disease.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Therefore, we sought a reliable index of old age by taking into consideration the distinguished Japanese seasons. Large amounts of eggs and dead bodies were present on the coast during and after the second half of May (MayS). Body mass decreased after May. We roughly classified animals collected before and after the MayS as mature and old animals. Plots of internalized shell length (S) against body mass (B) gave distinct best-fit curves for mature and old animals. The B/S significantly decreased in the second half of June, suggesting that body mass decreases with age but shell length is maintained in each animal. Therefore, the collected animals were classified into mature and old animals using the best-fit curves for animals classified by the collection period. We examined the amount of food intake every 2 h up to 8 h after providing food. The amounts increased linearly, and the rate was significantly lower in old animals than in mature animals. The amount of 1-day food intake was also significantly lower in old animals. These results suggest that food intake may decline with age and this may cause mass loss in old animals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Although some studies have investigated nutrition-specific morphological adaptations of the two species, broader studies on salivary enzymes in both elephant species are lacking. This study focuses on the comparison of salivary enzymes activity profiles in the two elephant species; these enzymes are relevant for protective and digestive functions in humans. We aimed to determine whether salivary amylase (sAA), lysozyme (sLYS), and peroxidase (sPOD) activities have changed in a species-specific pattern during evolutionary separation of the elephant genera. Saliva samples of 14 Asian and eight African elephants were collected in three German zoos. Results show that sAA and sLYS are salivary components of both elephant species in an active conformation. In contrast, little to no sPOD activity was determined in any elephant sample. Furthermore, sAA activity was significantly higher in Asian compared with African elephants. sLYS and sPOD showed no species-specific differences. The time of food provision until sample collection affected only sAA activity. In summary, the results suggest several possible factors modulating the activity of the mammal-typical enzymes, such as sAA, sLYS, and sPOD, e.g., nutrition and sampling procedure, which have to be considered when analyzing differences in saliva composition of animal species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study examines how these systems may have adapted in marine aquatic environments inhabited by cetaceans. Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are ideal study animals—they possess large subcutaneous adipose stores (blubber) and undergo bi-annual migrations concurrent with variations in food availability. To answer long-standing questions regarding how (or if) energy and lipid utilization adapted to aquatic stressors, we quantified variations in gene transcripts critical to lipid metabolism related to season, age, and blubber depth. We predicted leptin tertiary structure conservation and assessed inter-specific variations in Lep transcript numbers between bowheads and other mammals. Our study is the first to identify seasonal and age-related variations in Lep and lipolysis in these cetaceans. While Lep transcripts and protein oscillate with season in adult bowheads reminiscent of hibernating mammals, transcript levels reach up to 10 times higher in bowheads than any other mammal. Data from immature bowheads are consistent with the hypothesis that short baleen inhibits efficient feeding. Lipolysis transcripts also indicate young Fall bowheads and those sampled during Spring months limit energy utilization. These novel data from rarely examined species expand the existing knowledge and offer unique insight into how the regulation of Lep and lipolysis has adapted to permit seasonal deposition and maintain vital blubber stores.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Recently, drought-induced RCH, triggered by brief, mild desiccation, was described in larvae of the freeze-tolerant gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis). However, its prevalence and ecological significance in other insects is not known. Consequently, we used a freeze-intolerant model, the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, to investigate the effects and mechanisms of drought-induced RCH. In addition, we investigated how drought- and cold-induced RCH interact by exposing flies to both desiccation and chilling. Desiccation for 3 h increased larval pupariation after cold shock from 28 to 40 %—the first example of drought-induced RCH in both a freeze-intolerant insect and in a non-overwintering life stage. We also found that desiccation and chilling together enhanced the cold hardiness of larvae and adults more than either did separately, suggesting that drought and cold trigger distinct physiological mechanisms that interact to afford greater cold tolerance. These results suggest that drought-induced RCH is a highly conserved response used by insects with diverse life history strategies. Furthermore, the protective interaction between drought- and cold-induced RCH suggests that, in nature, insects use multiple cues and physiological mechanisms to fine-tune their response to changing ambient conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, we recorded the echolocation behavior of a broadband FM (Pipistrellus abramus) and a narrowband CF echolocator species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) while they explored an unfamiliar space in a laboratory chamber. During flight, P. abramus smoothly shifted its acoustic gaze in relation to its flight direction, whereas R. ferrumequinum nippon frequently shifted its acoustic gaze from side to side. The distribution of the acoustic gazes of R. ferrumequinum nippon was twice as wide as that of P. abramus. Furthermore, R. ferrumequinum nippon produced double pulses twice as often as P. abramus. Because R. ferrumequinum nippon has a horizontal beam width (−6 dB off-axis angle) half as wide (±20.8 ± 6.0°) as that of P. abramus (±38.3 ± 6.0°), it appears to double the width of its acoustical field of view by shifting its acoustic gaze further off-axis and emitting direction-shifted double pulses.

Both occurred mainly across the gills with only ~5 % of MAmm-N and ~39 % of MUrea-N via the urine. Tambaqui were not especially tolerant to high environmental ammonia (HEA), despite their great resistance to other environmental factors. Nevertheless, they were able to maintain a continued elevation of MAmm-N during and after 48-h exposure to 2.5 mmol L−1 HEA. The normally negative transepithelial potential (−18 mV) increased to −9 mV during the HEA period, which would help to reduce branchial NH4+ entry. During 3 h of acute environmental hypoxia (30 % saturation), MAmm-N declined, and recovered thereafter, similar to the response seen in other hypoxia-tolerant teleosts; MUrea-N did not change. However, during gradual hypoxia, MAmm-N remained constant, but MUrea-N eventually fell. The acute temperature sensitivities of MAmm-N and MN were low from 28 °C (acclimation) to 33 °C (Q10 ~1.5), but high (~3.8) from 33 to 38 °C, relative to $$ M_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }} $$MO2 (~1.9 throughout). In contrast, MUrea-N exhibited a different pattern over these temperature ranges (Q10 2.6 and 2.1, respectively).

Despite this, intracellular ADP diffusion is restricted. Intriguingly, although diffusion is restricted, trout cardiomyocytes seem to lack the coupling between mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK) and respiration. Our aim was to study the distribution of diffusion restrictions in permeabilized trout cardiomyocytes and verify the role of CK. We found a high activity of hexokinase (HK), which led us to reassess the situation in trout cardiomyocytes. We show that diffusion restrictions are more prominent than previously thought. In the presence of a competitive ADP-trapping system, ADP produced by HK, but not CK, was channeled to the mitochondria. In agreement with this, we found no positively charged mitochondrial CK in trout heart homogenate. The results were best fit by a simple mathematical model suggesting that trout cardiomyocytes lack a functional coupling between ATPases and pyruvate kinase. The model simulations show that diffusion is restricted to almost the same extent in the cytosol and by the outer mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, they confirm that HK, but not CK, is functionally coupled to respiration. In perspective, our results suggest that across a range of species, cardiomyocyte morphology and metabolism go hand in hand with cardiac performance, which is adapted to the circumstances. Mitochondrial CK is coupled to respiration in adult mammalian hearts, which are specialized to high, sustained performance. HK associates with mitochondria in hearts of trout and neonatal mammals, which are more hypoxia-tolerant.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

One routine challenge for ammonia balance that fish encounter is feeding and digestion. Fortunately, many new studies have revealed the impact of feeding and digestion on several aspects of ammonia balance; from production to excretion and to transport, and several have done so incorporating supplemental extrinsic and/or intrinsic factors. Together, these complex studies reveal realistic responses to multifactorial challenges encountered by animals in the wild and begin to provide a holistic view of ammonia balance in freshwater teleost fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We compared activities of electron transport system (ETS) complexes in intact liver mitochondria isolated from 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) sampled during torpor and IBE to investigate potential sites of this reversible metabolic suppression. Flux through complexes I–IV and II–IV was suppressed by 40 and 60 %, respectively, in torpor, while flux through complexes III–IV and IV did not differ between torpor and IBE. We also measured maximal enzyme activity of ETS enzymes in homogenized isolated mitochondria and whole liver tissue. In isolated mitochondria, activities of complexes I and II were significantly lower in torpor relative to IBE, but complexes III, IV, and V did not differ. In liver tissue, only activity of complex II was suppressed during torpor relative to IBE. Despite the significant differences in both ETS flux and maximal activity, the protein content of complexes I and II did not differ between torpor and IBE.

Many foraging tasks rely on vision, e.g. spatial orientation and detection of food sources and nest entrances. Meliponini workers are usually small, which sets limits on eye morphology and thus quality of vision. Limitations are expected both on acuity, and thus on the ability to detect objects from a distance, as well as on sensitivity, and thus on the foraging time window at dusk and dawn. In this study, we determined light intensity thresholds for flight under dim light conditions in eight stingless bee species in relation to body size in a Neotropical lowland rainforest. Species varied in body size (0.8–1.7 mm thorax-width), and we found a strong negative correlation with light intensity thresholds (0.1–79 lx). Further, we measured eye size, ocelli diameter, ommatidia number, and facet diameter. All parameters significantly correlated with body size.

This study aimed at determining potential differences in rates and maximal level of growth, and in pre-hibernation body fat mass between early and late-born juvenile garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus), and kept in outdoor enclosures with ad libitum food and water.

We also assessed fat content in a group of juveniles during pre-hibernation fattening (n = 16) and after their first winter hibernation (n = 18). During the pre-weaning phase, young from early and late litters mainly grew structurally and gained mass at similar rates. After weaning, late-born juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as early born individuals. Body mass was positively associated with fat content during pre-hibernation fattening. Late-born females reached similar structural sizes, but had lower pre-hibernation fat reserves than early born females. Conversely, late-born males showed lower maximal size and pre-hibernation body fat content, compared with early born males.

One environmental disturbance that mussels may encounter that remains understudied is an increase in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2). The present study quantified the impacts of acute (6 h) and chronic (up to 32 days) exposures to elevated pCO2 on genes associated with shell formation (chitin synthase; cs) and the stress response (heat shock protein 70; hsp70) in Fusconaia flava. Oxygen consumption (MO2) was also assessed over the chronic CO2 exposure period. Although mussels exhibited an increase in cs following an acute exposure to elevated pCO2, long-term exposure resulted in a decrease in cs mRNA abundance, suggesting that mussels may invest less in shell formation during chronic exposure to elevated pCO2. In response to an acute elevation in pCO2, mussels increased hsp70 mRNA abundance in mantle and adductor muscle and a similar increase was observed in the gill and adductor muscle in response to a chronic elevation in pCO2. A chronic elevation in pCO2 also increased mussel MO2. This overall increase in hsp70 mRNA levels and MO2 in F. flava indicates that exposure to elevated pCO2 initiates activation of the general stress response and an increased energy demand. Together, the results of the present study suggest that freshwater mussels respond to elevated pCO2 by increasing processes necessary to ‘deal with’ the stressor and, over the long-term, may reduce their investment in non-essential processes such as shell growth.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The effectiveness of air breathing for tissue O2 supply depends on the ability to avoid O2 loss as oxygenated blood from the air-breathing organ passes through the gills. Here, we evaluated whether the armoured catfish (Hypostomus aff. pyreneusi)—a facultative air breather—can avoid branchial O2 loss while air breathing in aquatic hypoxia, and we measured various other respiratory and metabolic traits important for O2 supply and utilization. Fish were instrumented with opercular catheters to measure the O2 tension (PO2) of expired water, and air breathing and aquatic respiration were measured during progressive stepwise hypoxia in the water. Armoured catfish exhibited relatively low rates of O2 consumption and gill ventilation, and gill ventilation increased in hypoxia due primarily to increases in ventilatory stroke volume. Armoured catfish began air breathing at a water PO2 of 2.5 kPa, and both air-breathing frequency and hypoxia tolerance (as reflected by PO2 at loss of equilibrium, LOE) was greater in individuals with a larger body mass. Branchial O2 loss, as reflected by higher PO2 in expired than in inspired water, was observed in a minority (4/11) of individuals as water PO2 approached that at LOE. Armoured catfish also exhibited a gill morphology characterized by short filaments bearing short fused lamellae, large interlamellar cell masses, low surface area, and a thick epithelium that increased water-to-blood diffusion distance. Armoured catfish had a relatively low blood-O2 binding affinity when sampled in normoxia (P50 of 3.1 kPa at pH 7.4), but were able to rapidly increase binding affinity during progressive hypoxia exposure (to a P50 of 1.8 kPa). Armoured catfish also had low activities of several metabolic enzymes in white muscle, liver, and brain. Therefore, low rates of metabolism and gill ventilation, and a reduction in branchial gas-exchange capacity, may help minimize branchial O2 loss in armoured catfish while air breathing in aquatic hypoxia.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Web architecture should affect signal design, and vice versa, such that vibratory signals are transmitted with a minimum of attenuation and degradation. However, the web is the medium through which a spider senses both vibratory signals from courting males and cues produced by captured prey. Moreover, webs function not only in vibration transmission, but also in defense from predators and the elements. These multiple functions may impose conflicting selection pressures on web design. We investigated vibration transmission efficiency and accuracy through two web types with contrasting architectures: sheet webs of Eratigena agrestis (Agelenidae) and tangle webs of Latrodectus hesperus (Theridiidae). We measured vibration transmission efficiencies by playing frequency sweeps through webs with a piezoelectric vibrator and a loudspeaker, recording the resulting web vibrations at several locations on each web using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Transmission efficiencies through both web types were highly variable, with within-web variation greater than among-web variation. There was little difference in transmission efficiencies of longitudinal and transverse vibrations. The inconsistent transmission of specific frequencies through webs suggests that parameters other than frequency are most important in allowing these spiders to distinguish between vibrations of prey and courting males.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It is a powerful antioxidant commonly used to prevent reperfusion injury to the heart after infarction. We show here it has other more far-reaching effects on cardiac function. Using the Drosophila model, we show that injection of melatonin increases the regularity of heartbeat significantly and can rescue rhythmicity in flies bearing mutations that adversely affect cardiac function. Notably, melatonin increases cardiac regularity independent of alteration of heart rate. We provide compelling evidence that melatonin’s action as an antioxidant is not the mechanism underlying improved cardiac performance. We have strong evidence that melatonin’s action on the heart is mediated via a specific G-Protein-coupled receptor encoded by the CG 4313 gene that our results implicate as a candidate melatonin receptor.

We have previously proposed that the presence of a functional parasympathetic innervation of the ventricle was indicative of heterothermy, and is essential for maintaining ventricular stability at low body temperature. However, it is possible that the presence of such an innervation is also representative of the primitive mammalian state. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a functional parasympathetic innervation of the ventricle, that is capable of actively reducing the force of contraction, is present across metatherian mammals. Using in vitro isolated cardiac preparations, we examined evidence for a functional ventricular parasympathetic innervation of the ventricle in two species of metatherian mammal, one heterotherm (Western pygmy possum; Cercatetus concinnus) and one homeotherm (Golden bandicoot; Isoodon auratus), from different families to complement existing data from a heterothermic dasyurid. Both C. concinnus and I. auratus had a potent biphasic response to transmural electrical stimulation in both atrial and ventricular preparations. Both the decrease and increase in the force of contraction in response to stimulation were almost entirely blocked by the cholinergic and adrenergic antagonists, atropine and propranolol, respectively. These observations provide clear evidence for a parasympathetic innervation of the ventricle that is capable of directly influencing the force of contraction across metatherian mammals with different thermoregulatory strategies. While this innervation may facilitate heterothermy, this suggests that the presence of such an innervation pattern is indicative of the primitive mammalian state.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, despite its ecological and economic relevance, little is known regarding its immune responses under thermal stress. Here, the main goal was to study the response of sea cucumbers to temperature stress, assessing sub-organismal alterations and acclimation capacities of juveniles to temperature changes. After changing temperature (1 °C/day) for 6 days, organisms were exposed to temperature conditions of 21 °C (cold), 27 °C (control), and 33 °C (warm) over a 30 day period. At each 15-day interval (T0, T15, and T30), six replicates per condition were killed for biochemical analysis. Immune responses were addressed by studying the activity of phenoloxidase
(PO) and prophenoloxidase (ProPO) in the coelomic fluid. Antioxidant defence responses—catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymatic activities—were measured in the muscle and respiratory tree tissues, whereas oxidative damage was evaluated by measuring levels of superoxide radicals (ROS), DNA-strand breaks and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Juvenile H. scabra increased SOD and PO activities when temperature was elevated, and revealed low levels of ROS and damage in both cold and warm treatments throughout the experiment, confirming the organism’s moderate thermal stress. After the short acclimation period, the immune and antioxidant responses prevented damage and maintained homeostasis. This multi-biomarker approach highlights its usefulness to monitor the health of H. scabra and to gain insight concerning the use of this high-valued species in global-scale aquaculture from different temperature regions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Phylogenetic analysis showed three major clades corresponding to SIRT1–3, SIRT4–5, and SIRT6–7 that reflected the present hierarchy of vertebrates and the accepted classification of SIRTs. Transcriptional studies revealed a ubiquitous SIRT gene expression that was tissue-specific for each SIRT. This was evidenced by multivariate analyses, which established two main clusters corresponding to SIRTs with relatively high (SIRT1, 2, and 5) and low (SIRT3, 4, 6, and 7) gene expression levels. A nutritional regulation was also evidenced in 10-day fasted fish, and SIRT2–4 exhibited an overall downregulated expression. SIRT1, 5, 6, and 7 were mostly upregulated, although clustering analyses evidenced a highly regulated response that was different for each SIRT according to the different tissue metabolic capabilities.

Weightlifting is associated with increases in stroke amplitude (the angle swept by the wings) to increase the angular velocity of the wings and generate the requisite lift, but only up to 160°. Conversely, flight in hypodense air is accomplished by increasing the angular velocity of the wing through increases in wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitudes, with larger increases in amplitude than seen in weightlifting flight. The kinematic differences between these two challenges may be facilitated by the lower energetic costs associated with overcoming drag and inertial forces over the wing during hypodense flight. Thus, we hypothesized that energetic expenditure is what limits the kinematics of weightlifting flight, with lower air densities permitting increases in angular velocity at comparatively lower costs. To explore the kinematic and energetic effects of air density and weightlifting on hovering flight performance, video and respirometric recordings of weightlifting were performed on four species of hummingbirds across an elevational gradient. Contrary to our hypothesis, wingbeat frequency did not vary due to elevation. Instead, wingbeat frequency seems to increase depending on the power requirements for sustaining hovering flight. Furthermore, metabolic rates during hovering increased with angular velocity alone, independent of elevation. Thus, it appears that the differential responses to flight challenges are not driven by variation in the flight media.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We showed that the outcome of aggression experiments between the non-aggressive species P. orizabaensis and its aggressive competitor Trigona fuscipennis is influenced by the number of bees that arrive early after food source discovery. Therefore, the increased activity during less favorable weather conditions and the fast recruitment of nestmates following the discovery of a food source, as observed for P. orizabaensis, may be adaptations that evolved to coexist even with more aggressive and dominant species of stingless bees, with which P. orizabaensis has to compete for resources.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Yet, we know little about how health and energy expenditure are shaped by harsh environmental conditions in free-living vertebrates. Here, we studied how African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) that survived summer droughts differed in their energy expenditure and health from non-survivors. Specifically, we tested whether: (1) survivors’ and non-survivors’ health and energy expenditure differed before environmental conditions declined; (2) non-survivors were in poorer health and had greater energy expenditure than survivors when conditions were harshest; (3) non-survivors’ health deteriorated more than that of survivors as conditions deteriorated; and (4) survivors recovered once conditions improved. Survivors and non-survivors’ health was assessed using VetsScan ABAXIS, while energy expenditure was measured as resting metabolic rate (RMR). Before conditions declined, non-survivors had lower energy stores and higher globulin levels than survivors. As conditions became harsher, survivors’ and non-survivors’ health deteriorated but only non-survivors showed signs of permanent pathology (increased glucose and decreased globulin). Once conditions improved, survivors’ health improved but was not fully restored (increased alanine aminotransferase and decreased globulin). Furthermore, while survivors and non-survivors had similar RMR before conditions became harsh; their levels diverged considerably when conditions deteriorated, with survivors having a decreased RMR and non-survivors having an increased RMR. Our results show that an individual’s health before facing an environmental challenge and the way it regulates its RMR influences its ability to maintain homeostasis when conditions become more taxing.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We never observed any scent marking behavior and feeders baited with labial or mandibular gland extracts were not attractive for the bees. Chemical analyses showed that the foragers’ labial gland secretions exclusively contain long chain hydrocarbons, which render their role in recruitment communication unlikely. Whether mandibular gland secretions, which contain esters and alcohols that are known as attractive pheromones in other bee species, are used to guide recruits toward food during flight, remains elusive. We conclude that Partamona’s quick recruitment system that does not rely on conspicuous scent marks has evolved as a strategy against competition with sympatrically occurring and more aggressive bee species.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Our approach enables monitoring of individual bees in the social context of a mini colony under controlled laboratory conditions. In a pilot experiment, we show that social contact with the mini colony improves the survival of monitored young individuals and affects locomotor activity patterns of young and old bees. When exposed to conflicting Zeitgebers consisting of a light–dark (LD) cycle that is phase-delayed with respect to the mini colony rhythm, rhythms of young and old bees are socially synchronized with the mini colony rhythm, whereas isolated bees synchronize to the LD cycle.

Accordingly, foragers should reject food sources presenting these chemical cues. Contrasting this assumption, experimental studies in stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini), so far, demonstrated an attractive effect of footprints. These findings lead to doubts about the meaning of these chemical cues in natural foraging contexts. Here, we asked whether foragers of stingless bees (Melipona scutellaris) use footprints according to the previously experienced reward level of visited food sources. Bees were trained to artificial flower patches, at which the reward of a flower either decreased or, alternatively, increased after a visit by a forager. Individuals were allowed a total of nine foraging bouts to the patch, after which their preference for visited or unvisited flowers was tested. In the choice tests, bees trained under the decreasing reward context preferred unvisited flowers, whereas individuals trained under the increasing reward context preferred visited flowers.

Recent discoveries suggest singing by bats might be surprisingly more diverse and widespread than anticipated, but if true then two questions must be addressed: firstly why has singing been so rarely documented among bats, and secondly do bats sing for the same reasons as songbirds? We address the first question by reviewing how sampling bias and technical constraints may have produced a myopic view of bat social communication. To address the second question, we review evidence from 50 years of batsong literature supporting the supposition that bat singing is linked to the same constellation of ecological variables that favored birdsong, including territoriality, polygyny, metabolic constraints, migratory behaviors and especially powered flight. We propose that bats sing like birds because they fly like birds; flight is energetically expensive and singing reduces time spent flying.

Recently, species have been shown to vary in color vision across populations as a result of differences in regulatory sequence and/or plasticity of opsin gene expression. For decades, biologists have been intrigued by among-population variation in color-based mate preferences of female Trinidadian guppies. We proposed that some of this variation results from variation in color vision caused by plasticity in opsin expression. Specifically, we asked about the role of dietary carotenoid availability, because carotenoids (1) are the precursors for vitamin A, which is essential for the creation of photopigments and (2) have been linked to variation in female mate choice. We raised guppies on different carotenoid-level diets and measured opsin expression. Guppies raised on high-carotenoid diets expressed higher levels of long wavelength sensitive opsin (LWS) opsins than those raised on lower levels of carotenoids. These results suggest that dietary effects on opsin expression represent a previously unaccounted for mechanism by which ecological differences across populations could lead to mate choice differences.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Although the behavioral relevance of distress vocalizations is undeniable, at present, little is known about the rules that govern vocalization production when in alarmful situations. In this article, we show that when distressed, bats of the species Carollia perspicillata produce repetitive vocalization sequences in which consecutive syllables are likely to be similar to one another regarding their physical attributes. The uttered distress syllables are broadband (12–73 kHz) with most of their energy focussing at 23 kHz. Distress syllables are short (~4 ms), their average sound pressure level is close to 70 dB SPL, and they are produced at high repetition rates (every 14 ms). We discuss that, because of their physical attributes, bat distress vocalizations could serve a dual purpose: (1) advertising threatful situations to conspecifics, and (2) informing the threatener that the bats are ready to defend themselves. We also discuss possible advantages of advertising danger/discomfort using repetitive utterances, a calling strategy that appears to be ubiquitous across the animal kingdom.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These include path integration, a system that keeps track of the straight-line distance and direction travelled on the current trip, the use of panoramic landmarks and scenery for orientation, and systematic searching. A traditional view is that only one navigational system is in operation at any one time, with different systems running in sequence depending on the context and conditions. We review selected data suggesting that often, different navigational cues (e.g., compass cues) and different systems of navigation are in operation simultaneously in desert ant navigation. The evidence suggests that all systems operate in parallel forming a heterarchical network. External and internal conditions determine the weights to be accorded to each cue and system. We also show that a model of independent modules feeding into a central summating device, the Navinet model, can in principle account for such data. No central executive processor is necessary aside from a weighted summation of the different cues and systems. Such a heterarchy of parallel systems all in operation represents a new view of insect navigation that has already been expressed informally by some authors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The protein supply necessary for successful brood production is ensured through adjustments of the colonies’ pollen foraging according to the availability of this resource in the environment. In honey bees Apis mellifera, in addition, pollen foraging is regulated through the broods’ demand for this resource. Here, we investigated the influence of the colony’s pollen store level on pollen foraging and brood production in stingless bees (Melipona subnitida). When pollen was added to the nests, colonies increased their brood production and reduced their pollen foraging within 24 h. On the other hand, when pollen reserves were removed, colonies significantly reduced their brood production. In strong contrast to A. mellifera; however, M. subnitida did not significantly increase its pollen foraging activity under poor pollen store conditions. This difference concerning the regulation of pollen foraging may be due to differences regarding the mechanism of brood provisioning. Honey bees progressively feed young larvae and, consequently, require a constant pollen supply. Stingless bees, by contrast, mass-provision their brood cells and temporary absence of pollen storage will not immediately result in substantial brood loss.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

How small mammals deal physiologically with changes in landscape and food availability due to fire remains largely unknown, although recent studies on small heterothermic terrestrial mammals have shown an increase in post-fire torpor use to reduce energy and foraging requirements. However, data on the behavioural and physiological responses of bats after fires are scarce, although potentially these volant species may differ from terrestrial mammals. Therefore, we investigated the post-fire thermal biology and activity of lesser long-eared bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi) using temperature-telemetry in Warrumbungle National Park, NSW, which experienced a devastating wildfire in 2013. The study comprised two field seasons, one in 2013 within 4 months after the fire, and one in 2015 two years after the fire to identify potential changes in behaviour and physiology. Interestingly, soon after the fire, bats showed significantly shorter torpor bout duration (11.8 ± 12.5 h) and longer normothermia duration (8.7 ± 4.6 h) in comparison to those in 2015 (torpor bout duration: 24.1 ± 23.5 h; normothermia duration: 2.5 ± 1.5 h). Insect availability was significantly (20-fold) higher in 2013 than in 2015, which was likely an important factor resulting in the short average torpor bout duration by N. geoffroyi after the fire. Our data indicate that volant bats appear to show the opposite post-fire behavioural and physiological responses to small terrestrial mammals, showing longer normothermic and active periods and shorter torpor bouts to capitalise on an increase in available post-fire resources.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Evans blue and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-biotin both bind to blood proteins, and are impermeable to the blood–brain barrier. Intraperitoneal injection of these probes stained the walls of the preoptic recess (PR) of the third ventricle, indicating increased vascular permeability in this region.

Simultaneously, the number of immunohistochemically identified cFos-expressing neurons in the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPa) of the PR walls increased in a site-specific manner by approximately 1.6-fold compared with controls.

Here we address the range of sounds that elicit unconditioned behavioral responses in squid Doryteuthispealeii, the types of responses generated, and how responses change over multiple sound exposures. A variety of response types were evoked, from inking and jetting to body pattern changes and fin movements. Squid responded to sounds from 80 to 1000 Hz, with response rates diminishing at the higher and lower ends of this frequency range. Animals responded to the lowest sound levels in the 200–400 Hz range. Inking, an escape response, was confined to the lower frequencies and highest sound levels; jetting was more widespread. Response latencies were variable but typically occurred after 0.36 s (mean) for jetting and 0.14 s for body pattern changes; pattern changes occurred significantly faster. These results demonstrate that squid can exhibit a range of behavioral responses to sound include fleeing, deimatic and protean behaviors, all of which are associated with predator evasion.

Our aims were (1) to determine the pattern of metabolic adjustments following a rapid temperature change, (2) to determine whether performance varies at similar rates during exposure to warm or cold environments, and (3) to determine if BMR, Msum and MMR change at comparable rates during thermal acclimation. We measured these parameters in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis), black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), and snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) after acclimation to 10 °C (day 0) and on the 4th and 8th days of acclimation to either −5 or 28 °C. Birds changed their metabolic phenotype within 8 days with patterns differing among species. Sparrows expressed the expected metabolic increases in the cold and decreases at thermoneutrality while performance in chickadees and buntings was not influenced by temperature but changed over time with inverse patterns. Our results suggest that BMR varies at comparable rates in warm and cold environments but changes faster than Msum and MMR, likely due to limitations in the rate of change in organ size and function. They also suggest that maximal metabolic capacity is lost faster in a warm environment than it is gained in a cold environment. With the expected increase in temperature stochasticity at northern latitudes, a loss of thermogenic capacity during warm winter days could, therefore, be detrimental if birds are slow to readjust their phenotype with the return of cold days.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In regeneration-competent organisms, glial scar formation has been a matter of controversy. We addressed this issue by examining the glial population after spinal cord injury in a model of regeneration competency, the knifefish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Analysis of spinal cord sections immunostained against the glial markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan failed to produce any evidence for the formation of a glial scar in the area of the lesion at post-injury survival times ranging from 5 to 185 days. This result was independent of the lesion paradigm applied—amputation of the caudal part of the spinal cord or hemisection lesioning—and similar after examination of transverse and longitudinal sections. We hypothesize that the well-developed network of radial glia in both the intact and the injured spinal cord provides a support system for regeneration of tissue lost to injury. This glial network is likely also involved in the generation of new cells, as indicated by the large subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein-labeled glia that express the stem cell marker Sox2.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Differences of life-history traits are thought to result from trade-offs between behavioral and physiological aspects in each species as mediated by the biotic and abiotic environment, as well as genetic mechanisms. Domestic animals tend to show inverse relationships between body size and life span. Dogs are a good example of this, with smaller dogs having higher mass-specific metabolic rates and longer lifespans compared with larger dogs. Thus, dogs provide a unique system to examine physiological consequences of life-history trade-offs. I have collected data from the literature to explore implications of these trade-offs at several levels of physiological organization including whole-animal, organ systems, and cells. Small dogs tend to have longer lifespans, fewer pups per litter, faster and shorter developmental trajectories, and higher mass-specific metabolic rates, and in general, larger metabolically active organs compared with large dogs. From work on isolated primary fibroblast cells and telomeres of dogs, I show that selection for body size may influence the attributes of cells that shape proliferative cellular rates and rates of telomere shortening. The potential links between body size, and cellular oxidative stress in dogs as they age are discussed. Furthermore, small size in dogs has been linked to concentrations of reduced insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in plasma, a possible metabolic advantage that may provide higher resistance to oxidative stress, a parameter essential to increases in lifespan.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Using in vivo and in vitro transport assays, uptake and tissue distribution of the waterborne amino acids l-alanine, l-lysine, and l-phenylalanine were examined as a function of fed state. All three amino acids were shown to be taken up from the water (lysine and phenylalanine for the first time). Following immersion in radiolabelled solutions for 24 h, phenylalanine was the amino acid that accumulated at the highest levels in almost all tissues, with the highest accumulation noted in red blood cells and bile, followed by gill and liver. In general, tissues of fed hagfish displayed a significantly reduced phenylalanine accumulation compared to tissues of hagfish fasted for 3 weeks. An in vitro assay showed that phenylalanine was transported across the skin at the highest rate, with the uptake of lysine occurring at the lowest rate. Feeding status had no significant effect on in vitro transport. These data indicate that dissolved organic nutrients are a significant source of nutrition to hagfish, and may be relatively more important during periods of fasting than during periods of feeding when immersed in decaying carcasses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Threespine stickleback inhabit a range of environments that vary in both salinity and thermal stability making this species an excellent system for investigating interacting stressors. We examined the effects of environmental salinity on maximum thermal tolerance (CTMax) and 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) gene expression using divergent stickleback ecotypes from marine and freshwater habitats. In both ecotypes, the CTMax of fish acclimated to 20 ppt was significantly higher compared to fish acclimated to 2 ppt. The effect of salinity acclimation on the expression of hsp70-1 and hsp70-2 was similar in both the marine and freshwater stickleback ecotype. There were differences in the expression profiles of hsp70-1 and hsp70-2 during heat shock, with hsp70-2 being induced earlier and to a higher level compared to hsp70-1. These data suggest that the two hsp70 isoforms may have functionally different roles in the heat shock response.

Concurrent changes in other physiological systems, such as the reproductive endocrine or innate immune systems, have received less attention, particularly in wild vertebrates. It is often thought that glucocorticoids directly modulate immune performance during a stress response, but, in many species, androgens also rapidly respond to stress. However, to our knowledge, no study has simultaneously examined the interactions between the glucocorticoid, androgen, and innate immune responses to stress in a wild vertebrate. To address this issue, we tested the hypothesis that the change in plasma corticosterone (CORT) in response to the acute stress of capture and restraint is correlated with the concurrent changes in plasma testosterone (T) and innate immune performance (estimated by the capacity of plasma to agglutinate and lyse foreign cells) in the Abert’s Towhee (Melozone aberti). Furthermore, to broaden the generality of the findings, we compared male and female towhees, as well as males from urban and non-urban populations. Acute stress increased plasma CORT, decreased plasma T in males, and decreased innate immune performance, but the increase in CORT during stress was not correlated with the corresponding decreases in either plasma T or innate immunity. By contrast, the plasma T stress response was positively correlated with the innate immune stress response. Collectively, our results challenge the proposition that the glucocorticoid stress response is correlated with the concurrent changes in plasma T, a key reproductive hormone, and innate immunity, as estimated by agglutination and lysis.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

One topic that is particularly understudied is the process of nutrient uptake across the elasmobranch gastrointestinal tract. Given their carnivorous diet, the present study sought to expand knowledge on dietary nutrient uptake in elasmobranchs by focusing on the uptake of products of protein digestion. To accomplish this, a full-length cDNA encoding peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), a protein previously identified within the brush border membrane of vertebrates that is responsible for the translocation of peptides released during digestion by luminal and membrane-bound proteases, was isolated from the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo). A cDNA encoding the related peptide transporter PepT2 was also isolated from S. tiburo using the same methodology. The presence of PepT1 was then localized in multiple components of the bonnethead digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, duodenum, intestine, rectum, and pancreas) using immunohistochemistry. Vesicle studies were used to identify the apparent affinity of PepT1 and to quantify the rate of dipeptide uptake by its H+-dependent cotransporter properties.

We examined whether the concentration of nectar carried from the nest changes with the need for sugar. We found that pollen foragers had more-concentrated nectar (61.8 %) than nectar foragers (43.8 %). Further analysis revealed that the sugar concentration of the crop load increased significantly with waggle duration, an indicator of food-source distance, in both groups of foragers. Crop volume also increased with waggle duration. The results support our argument that foragers use concentrated nectar when the need for sugar is high and suggest that they precisely adjust the amount of sugar in the crop by altering both volume and nectar concentrations. We also investigated the impact of the area where foragers receive nectar on the crop load concentration at departure. Although nectar and pollen foragers tend to load nectar at different areas in the nest, area did not have a significant effect on crop load concentration. Departing foragers showed an average of 2.2 momentary (<1 s) begging trophallactic contacts before leaving the nest.

Escapes are frequently initiated when an animal is already in motion. This may introduce constraints that alter the escape performance. In fish, escape maneuvers and steady, body caudal fin (BCF) swimming are driven by distinct patterns of curvature of the body axis. Pre-existing muscle activity may therefore delay or diminish a response. To quantify the performance consequences of escaping in flow, escape behavior was examined in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in both still-water and during steady swimming. Escapes executed during swimming were kinematically less variable than those made in still-water. Swimming escapes also had increased response latencies and lower peak velocities and accelerations than those made in still-water. Performance was also lower for escapes made up rather than down-stream, and a preference for down-stream escapes may be associated with maximizing performance.

During this journey, eels perform extended diel vertical migrations, and the concomitant changes in hydrostatic pressure significantly affect the swimbladder, functioning as a buoyancy organ. As the swimbladder is primarily filled with oxygen, the tissue has to cope with extreme hyperoxic conditions, which typically are accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. In addition, since the introduction of the parasitic nematode Anguillicola crassus in the early 1980s, swimbladder function of most of the European eels is impaired by the infection with this parasite. However, the exact pathways to detoxify ROS and how these pathways are affected by silvering or the infection are still unknown. In swimbladder and muscle tissue from uninfected and infected yellow, and from uninfected and infected silver eels, we measured the level of lipid peroxidation, which increases with ROS stress. To assess the capacity of the ROS defense systems, we analyzed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR), and determined the concentration of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH + GSSG). In swimbladder tissue, we found increased concentrations of GSH + GSSG as well as higher activities of SOD, GPx and GR, suggesting that SOD and the glutathione cycle are important for ROS detoxification. Comparing swimbladder tissue of uninfected yellow with uninfected silver eels, the concentration of GSH + GSSG and the activity of SOD were higher after silvering, corresponding with lower levels of lipid peroxidation. Whereas in yellow eels the infection with A. crassus had no effect, in silver eels the capacity to cope with ROS was significantly impaired. In muscle tissue, silvering or the infection only affected the activity of SOD but in exactly the same way as in swimbladder tissue.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

For anatomical reasons, differences in blood composition are expected among puncture sites. However, this issue has been rarely assessed and contrasted results have been reported: strong effects of puncture site versus a lack of effect. We captured free-ranging freshwater turtles from different locations to compare the mean concentrations of 12 blood parameters (metabolites, hormone, ions, and enzyme) among three puncture sites: (1) a lateral branch of the jugular vein, (2) a dorsal subcarapacial cervical plexus (sometimes incorrectly referred as the ‘cervical sinus’ in the literature), and (3) a caudal plexus site (sometimes incorrectly referred as the ‘caudal sinus’). Because we used very small syringes (27–30G), we were able to separate lymph, blood, or blood–lymph mixtures. Our results show very strong effects of puncture site and of mixture level (mean maximal difference between sites was 250 %). We also found strong sex and geographical effects. Typically, there were differences in concentrations of blood solutes sampled from the lateral jugular vein and subcarapacial plexus, mainly due to sampling a mixture of blood and lymph from the ‘blood’ at the subcarapacial site and pure blood from the lateral jugular site, and likewise, samples from the caudal site were highly variable due to often sampling a mixture of blood and lymph. These results have technical and fundamental implications, especially when performing comparative analyses. Further, by selecting precise puncture sites, physiological differences between lymph and blood compartments could be investigated.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

No annual variation in homing performance was observed at these sites in eastern North America, in contrast to results from a number of similar experiments in Europe. Assuming pigeons home using low-frequency infrasonic signals (~0.1–0.3 Hz), as has been previously proposed, the annual and geographic variability in homing performance within the northern hemisphere might be explained, to a first order, by seasonal changes in low-frequency atmospheric background noise levels related to storm activity in the North Atlantic Ocean, and by acoustic waveguides formed between the surface and seasonally reversing stratospheric winds. In addition, increased dispersion among departure bearings of test birds on some North American release days was possibly caused by infrasonic noise from severe weather events during tornado and Atlantic hurricane seasons.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Cephalopods are sensitive to starvation because of high metabolic rates and growth rates related to their “live fast, die young” life history. We investigated how enzymatic capacities of key metabolic pathways are modulated during starvation in the common cuttlefish (Sepiaofficinalis) to gain insight into the metabolic organization of cephalopods and their strategies for coping with food limitation. In particular, lipids have traditionally been considered unimportant fuels in cephalopods, yet, puzzlingly, many species (including cuttlefish) mobilize the lipid stores in their digestive gland during starvation. Using a comprehensive multi-tissue assay of enzymatic capacities for energy metabolism, we show that, during long-term starvation (12 days), glycolytic capacity for glucose use is decreased in cuttlefish tissues, while capacities for use of lipid-based fuels (fatty acids and ketone bodies) and amino acid fuels are retained or increased. Specifically, the capacity to use the ketone body acetoacetate as fuel is widespread across tissues and gill has a previously unrecognized capacity for fatty acid catabolism, albeit at low rates. The capacity for de novo glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis), important for glucose homeostasis, likely is restricted to the digestive gland, contrary to previous reports of widespread gluconeogenesis among cephalopod tissues. Short-term starvation (3–5 days) had few effects on enzymatic capacities. Similar to vertebrates, lipid-based fuels, putatively mobilized from fat stores in the digestive gland, appear to be important energy sources for cephalopods, especially during starvation when glycolytic capacity is decreased perhaps to conserve available glucose.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Body temperature was recorded using subcutaneously implanted data loggers. The results demonstrate that although immergence and vernal emergence sequences of sex and age groups resembled those of most hibernators, particularly adult females delayed hibernation onset until up to early January. Thus, in contrast to other hibernators, female common hamsters hibernated for shorter periods than males and correspondingly spent less time in torpor. These sex differences were absent in juvenile hamsters. The period between the termination of hibernation and vernal emergence varied among individuals but did not differ between the sex and age groups. This period of preemergence euthermy was related to emergence body mass: individuals that terminated hibernation earlier in spring and had longer euthermic phases prior to emergence started the active season in a better condition. In addition, males with longer periods of preemergence euthermy had larger testes at emergence. In conclusion, females have to rely on sufficient food stores but may adjust the use of torpor in relation to the available external energy reserves, whereas males show a more pronounced energy-saving strategy by hibernating for longer periods. Nonetheless, food caches seem to be important for both males and females as indicated by the euthermic preemergence phase and the fact that some individuals, mainly yearlings, emerged with a higher body mass than shortly before immergence in autumn.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We trained both juvenile and adult snails with a single 0.5 h training session in CE and show that LTM was present 24 h later. Snails trained in a similar manner in just pond water show no LTM. We then asked if such training in CE conferred enhanced memory forming capabilities on these snails four weeks later. That is, would LTM be formed in these snails four weeks later following a single 0.5 h training session in pond water? We found that both adult and juvenile snails previously trained in CE one month previously had enhanced LTM formation abilities. The injection of a DNA methylation blocker, 5-AZA, prior to training in adult snails blocked enhanced LTM formation four weeks later. Finally, this enhanced LTM forming ability was not passed on to the next generation of snails.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Recent studies have unveiled a second function of Torso in the larval prothoracic gland (PG) as the receptor for the prothoracicotropic hormone, which triggers pupariation. As such, inhibition of Torso in the PG prolongs the larval growth period, thereby increasing the final pupa size. Here, we report that Torso also acts in the larval fat body, regulating body size in a manner opposite from that of Torso in PG. We confirmed the expression of torso mRNA in the larval fat body and its reduction by RNA interference (RNAi). Fat body-specific knockdown of torso, by either of the two independent RNAi transgenes, significantly decreased the final pupal size. We found that torso knockdown suppresses insulin/target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the fat body, as confirmed by repression of Akt and S6K. Notably, the decrease in insulin/TOR signaling and decrease of pupal size induced by the knockdown of torso were rescued by the expression of a constitutively active form of the insulin receptor or by the knockdown of FOXO. Our study revealed a novel role for Torso in the fat body with respect to regulation of insulin/TOR signaling and body size.

A function shift to the synthesis of large quantities of 30K proteins occurs in the degenerating silk gland cells during larval–pupal metamorphosis. The posterior silk gland developmental mutant model of silkworm was used in this study and changes in the programmed cell death (PCD) regulatory signals and 30K protein synthesis during silk gland degeneration were investigated. The results showed that PCD induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone was initiated early during larval–pupal metamorphosis in the mutant, but PCD proceeded slowly, resulting in the degeneration process of the silk gland being extended and took almost twice the time compared with the wild type. Caspase-dependent pathway signals regulated by Dronc in the silk gland cells of the mutant were significantly reduced, while the PCD initiation signal regulated by the Atg family was not delayed or reduced, and PCD-related epigenetic modification such as lysine methylation, acetylation, and succinylation, and tyrosine phosphorylation changed significantly. During the degeneration process in the mutant, 30K proteins were efficiently synthesized in the silk gland cells in stage PP1 even when no caspase protein was detected. Degeneration of the silk gland is a PCD process in which autophagy and apoptosis may participate. The degeneration process was regulated by a caspase-dependent pathway, while the synthesis of 30K proteins along with silk gland degeneration may not be entirely dependent on caspase signals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the first experiment, two groups of fish were kept under an LD cycle and fed at two different time points: in the middle of the light (ML) or in the middle of the dark (MD) phase. In the second experiment, fish fed at ML was fasted and kept under constant lighting (LL) conditions for 1 day. In both experiments, the samples from central (optic tectum and hypothalamus) and peripheral (liver) tissues were collected every 3 h throughout a 24 h cycle. The expression levels of clock genes bmal1a, clock1, per1b, cry2a, and cry5 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. All the clock genes analyzed in brain regions showed daily rhythms: clock1, bmal1a, and cry2a showed the acrophase approximately at the end of the light phase (ZT 8:43-11:22 h), whereas per1b and cry5 did so between the end of the dark phase and the beginning of the light phase, respectively (ZT 21:16-4:00 h). These rhythms persisted under constant conditions. No effect of the feeding time was observed in the brain. In the liver, however, the rhythms of clock1 and cry5 were influenced by feeding, and a shift was observed in the MD fish group (ZT 3:58 h for clock1 and 11:20 h for cry5).

In the present study, the involvement of the leptin system in lipid deposition and mobilization in rainbow trout during feeding and 1, 2 and 4 weeks of fasting was investigated in two lines of rainbow trout with different muscle and visceral adiposity: a fat line (FL) with high total energy reserves, high muscle adiposity, but low visceral adiposity and a lean line (LL) with lower total energy reserves and lower muscle adiposity, but higher visceral adiposity. During 4 weeks of fasting, muscle lipids decreased by 63 % in the FL fish, while no such energy mobilization from muscle occurred in the LL fish. On the other hand, lipid stores in liver and visceral adipose tissue was utilized to a similar extent by the two fish lines during fasting. Under normal feeding conditions, plasma leptin levels were higher in the LL than the FL fish, suggesting a possible contribution of visceral adipocytes to plasma leptin levels. Plasma leptin-binding protein levels did not differ between the lines and were not affected by fasting. After 4 weeks of fasting, the long leptin receptor and the leptin-binding protein isoforms 1 and 3 muscle expression increased in the LL fish, as well as hepatic expression of leptin A1 and the two binding protein isoforms.

Gill morphology, biochemistry and molecular physiology were examined, with an emphasis on genes encoding TJ proteins. Fish were either fed a control or salt-enriched diet (~10 % NaCl) for 4 weeks prior to IPW exposure for 24 h. Serum [Na+], [Cl−] and muscle moisture content were unaltered by salt feeding, but changed in response to IPW irrespective of diet. Dietary salt loading altered the morphology (reduced Na+–K+-ATPase-immunoreactive cell numbers and surface exposure of mitochondrion-rich cells), biochemistry (decreased vacuolar-type H+-ATPase activity) and molecular physiology (decreased nkaα1a and cftrII mRNA abundance) of the gill in a manner indicative of reduced active ion uptake activity. But in control fish and not salt-fed fish, gill mRNA abundance of nkaα1c increased and nbc decreased after IPW exposure. Genes encoding TJ proteins were typically either responsive to salt feeding or IPW, but select genes responded to combined experimental treatment (e.g. IPW responsive but only if fish were salt-fed). Therefore, using salt feeding and IPW exposure, new insights into what factors influence gill TJ proteins and the role that specific TJ proteins might play in regulating the barrier properties of the gill epithelium have been acquired. In particular, evidence suggests that TJ proteins in the gill epithelium, or the regulatory networks that control them, respond independently to external or internal stimuli.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It can therefore play very different signaling roles depending on specific physiological contexts. Much progress has been made in resolving mechanisms for TH signaling over the past 2 decades, and there has been increasing emphasis on the role of peripheral levels of regulation in determining ultimate TH action. This progress has revealed a complex regulatory network, where TH bioavailability and bioactivity are peripherally regulated by sometimes subtle mechanisms at various levels of organization, including membrane receptors and transporters on the cell surface, intracellular deiodinase enzymes, thyroid receptor isoforms and cytosolic thyroid hormone binding proteins, and via accessibility and subtypes of thyroid hormone response elements in the promoters of target genes. The majority of this research comes from disease models, and so the biological relevance of each of these regulatory levels has not been comprehensively explored. This review synthesizes what is known of these local levels of TH regulation, with particular focus on their functional roles in regulating animal response to environmental cues. While thorough analysis for all of these regulatory levels in any one study is currently unrealistic, an appreciation for their collective importance is necessary to frame comparative analyses in a relevant context.

In contrast, several hypoxia/anoxia-tolerant animals survive very similar situations. We evaluated herein the redox metabolism in the anoxia-tolerant land snail Helix aspersa after catalase inhibition by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) injection during a cycle of wide and abrupt change in oxygen availability. The exposure to anoxia for 5 h caused a change of only one of several parameters related to free radical metabolism: a rise in selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPX) activity in muscle of both saline- and ATZ-injected animals (by 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively). Catalase suppression had no effect in animals under normoxia or anoxia. However, during reoxygenation catalase suppression kept high levels of muscle Se-GPX activity (twofold higher than in saline-injected snails up to 30 min reoxygenation) and induced the increase in hepatopancreas SOD activity (by 22 %), indicating higher levels of ROS in both organs than in saline-injected animals. Additionally, catalase-suppressed snails showed 12 % higher levels of carbonyl protein—a sign of mild oxidative stress—in muscle during reoxygenation than those animals with intact catalase. No changes were observed in glutathione parameters (GSH, GSSG and GSSG:GSH ratio), TBARS, and GST activity in any of the experimental groups, in both organs.

Motilin-induced contractions differed in different parts of the stomach. Only the proximal corpus induced gastric contraction even at motilin 10−10 M, and strong contraction was induced by motilin 10−9 M in all parts of the stomach. The GPR38 mRNA expression was also higher in the proximal corpus than in the other sections, and the lowest expression was observed in the antrum. GPR38 mRNA expression varied with low expression in the mucosal layer and high expression in the muscle layer.

Unexpectedly, even under hyperoxic conditions (30 mg O2 L−1) the jeju continued to take air breaths, and compared with normoxic conditions the frequency was not reduced. Because the frequently air-exposed swimbladder tissue faces higher oxygen partial pressures than normally experienced by other fish tissues, it was hypothesized that in the facultative air-breathing jeju, swimbladder tissue would have a higher antioxidative capacity than the swimbladder tissue of the water breathing traira.

Echoes from frontally located targets arrive with first and second harmonics intact, leading to focused delay images. Echoes from offside or distant objects arrive with the second harmonic relatively weaker (lowpass-filtered), leading to defocused images, which prevents their clutter interference effects (Bates et al. J Exp Biol 214:394–401, 2011). Realistic targets contain several glints at slightly different distances and reflect several echoes at correspondingly different delays. The bat registers the delay of the nearest glint’s echoes in the time domain. The delays of echoes from the farther glints are registered in the frequency domain, from interference nulls in the spectrum. Lowpass-filtering of echoes directly affects the image of the nearest glint by defocusing the delay image. However, lowpass-filtering also is superimposed on the interference spectrum used to register the farther glints, which distorts the pattern of interference nulls, defocusing the farther glints inversely, in the spectral domain, before they are perceived as delays. Differences in blurring between time-domain and frequency-domain parts of images identifies separate computational paths to perceptually reconstruct objects and prevent interference from off-side or distant clutter.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this work we studied the case of two close-related bird species, Patagioenasmaculosa and Patagioenaspicazuro, whose vocalizations differ only in the timbre. The temporal modulation of the fundamental frequency is similar in both cases, differing only in the existence of sidebands around the fundamental frequency in the P. maculosa. We tested the hypothesis that the qualitative difference between these vocalizations lies in the nonlinear nature of the syrinx. In particular, we propose that the roughness of maculosa’s vocalizations is due to an asymmetry between the right and left vibratory membranes, whose nonlinear dynamics generate the sound. To test the hypothesis, we generated a biomechanical model for vocal production with an asymmetric parameter Q with which we can control the level of asymmetry between these membranes. Using this model we generated synthetic vocalizations with the principal acoustic features of both species. In addition, we confirmed the anatomical predictions by making post mortem inspection of the syrinxes, showing that the species with tonal song (picazuro) has a more symmetrical pair of membranes compared to maculosa.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here we examined male signal and female preference co-variation in three closely related, but allopatric species of Gryllus crickets and quantified male song traits as well as female preferences. We show that males differ conspicuously in either one of two relatively static song traits, carrier frequency or pulse rate; female preference functions for these traits also differed, and would in combination enhance species discrimination. In contrast, the relatively dynamic song traits, chirp rate and chirp duty cycle, show minimal divergence among species and relatively greater conservation of female preference functions. Notably, among species we demonstrate similar mechanistic rules for the integration of pulse and chirp time scales, despite divergence in pulse rate preferences. As these are allopatric taxa, selection for species recognition per se is unlikely. More likely sexual selection combined with conserved properties of preference filters enabled divergent coevolution of male song and female preferences.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Earlier, we have measured the OMT of adult birds from a range of species and found that smaller eyes transmitted more UV-light to the retina than larger eyes. In the current study we measured OMT during post-hatch development in Japanese quails and domestic chickens. We show that in both species, OMT decreases as the eye size increases similarly to that what was found across various species, but that quails have lower OMT than expected from eye size. In both species, lens transmittance decreases linearly with lens thickness suggesting that UV-transmittance through the lenses is not actively controlled, but instead determined by UV-absorbance and scattering that occur in all biological tissues. Contrary to earlier assumptions of high cornea transmittance, we found that cornea transmittance is more variable, substantially influencing whole eye transmittance in all age groups of quail and in young chickens. It seems that additional absorbing pigments are used to more actively control cornea transmittance and thereby also overall OMT.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In two closely related species, Chorthippus biguttulus and C. mollis, acoustic communication is the only experimentally characterized communication channel that elicits male courtship behaviour. However, courtship in these species involves extensive close-range interactions that are likely to be mediated by other signalling modalities, in particular chemical cues. We developed a bioassay to determine if female cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) act as chemical cues that induce courtship behaviour, and if males assess variation in CHCs to determine whether or not to court a female. The results of this approach provide evidence that grasshopper males use species- and sex-specific information from CHC signals and respond with a courtship song to the CHC profile of conspecific females but not to the CHC profile of heterospecific females and conspecific males. We conclude that males of C. biguttulus and C. mollis use multimodal channels for mating decisions, based on both acoustic and olfactory cues.

However, integral components of SJs and their contribution to barrier properties have received considerably less attention than those of vertebrate occluding junctions. In arthropods, SJ proteins have only been identified in Drosophila and among these are three integral claudin-like proteins, Megatrachea (Mega), Sinuous (Sinu) and Kune-kune (Kune), as well as a receptor-like transmembrane SJ protein known as Neurexin IV (Nrx IV). In this study, mega, sinu, kune and nrx IV are identified and characterized in aquatic larvae of the mosquito Aedes aegypti and a role for these proteins in ionoregulatory homeostasis is considered. Transcripts encoding Mega, Sinu, Kune and Nrx IV were found in iono/osmoregulatory tissues such as the midgut, Malpighian tubules, hindgut and anal papillae, but abundance was greater in the hindgut and anal papillae. Using immunohistochemical and western blot analysis it was found that Kune localized to the regions of intercellular contact between epithelial cells of the rectum and posterior midgut and in the apical membrane domain of the syncytial epithelium of anal papillae. To investigate a potential role for integral SJ proteins in larval A. aegypti iono/osmoregulation, abundance was examined in animals reared in freshwater or brackish water (30 % seawater). In iono/osmoregulatory epithelia, larvae exhibited tissue-specific alterations in mega mRNA and Kune protein abundance, but not sinu or nrxIV mRNA.

Animals were studied from the first day of hatching through fledging (12 days post-hatch, dph). Nestling whole-body metabolic rate began to show an endothermic response to cold temperature midway between hatching and fledging. Nestlings less than 5 dph were unable to maintain elevated $$\dot{V}{\text{o}}_{2}$$V˙o2 and body temperature when exposed to gradually decreasing temperature, whereas 7 dph nestlings maintained $$\dot{V}{\text{o}}_{2}$$V˙o2 until ~25 °C, after which $$\dot{V}{\text{o}}_{2}$$V˙o2 decreased. From 10 dph to fledging, animals maintained elevated $$\dot{V}{\text{o}}_{2}$$V˙o2 and body temperature when exposed to gradual cooling; full endothermic capacity was achieved. Ventilation followed a similar developmental trend to that of $$\dot{V}{\text{o}}_{2}$$V˙o2, with increases in 10 dph fledglings occurring in tidal volume rather than ventilation frequency.

Most analyses of the impacts have focused on changes in mean temperature, but increasing variance will also impact organisms and populations. We assessed the combined effects of the mean and the variance of temperature on thermal tolerances—i.e., critical thermal maxima, critical thermal minima, scope of thermal tolerance, and survival in Drosophilamelanogaster. Our six experimental climatic scenarios were: constant mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance; changing mean with zero variance or constant variance or increasing variance. Our key result was that environments with changing thermal variance reduce the scope of thermal tolerance and survival. Heat tolerance seems to be conserved, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with mean low as well as changing environmental temperatures. Flies acclimated to scenarios of changing variance—with either constant or changing mean temperatures—exhibited significantly lower survival rate. Our results imply that changing and constant variances would be just as important in future scenarios of climate change under greenhouse warming as increases in mean annual temperature.

Consequences of such situations are increased levels of reactive oxygen species. To avoid oxidative damage intertidal crabs appear to possess an efficient antioxidant defense system (ADS). However, to date, studies have not addressed the strategies that are adopted by the crabs when exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles. Towards this end we evaluated the ADS and the role of melatonin as an antioxidant in the locomotor muscle of the crab Neohelice granulata under conditions of severe hypoxia and reoxygenation. Total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals and the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione-S-transferase as well as the key enzyme of glutathione synthesis, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), were evaluated. Furthermore, GSH, GSH/GSSG index as well as hemolymph and cellular melatonin levels were evaluated. During hypoxia, increased GPx and GCL activity and decreased GSH and mitochondrial melatonin levels were observed, but during reoxygenation catalase activity increased and cytosolic melatonin levels decreased. It appears that the ADS in the locomotor muscle of N. granulata exert a modulating effect when being confronted with hypoxia and reoxygenation to avoid oxidative stress.

The difference holds across species and bears no consistent adaptive relation to the current light environments. In the most extensively studied L–S pair, two populations of M. relicta (Lp and Sp) separated for less than 10,000 years, no differences translating into amino acid substitutions have been found in the opsin genes, and the chromophore of the visual pigments as analyzed by HPLC is pure A1.

ERG recordings of responses to “red” and “blue” light linearly polarized at orthogonal angles indicate segregation of the pigments into different cells differing in polarization sensitivity.

Adult male zebrafish were exercised 6 h/day for 4 weeks, 6 h/day for 2 weeks, or 3 h/day for 2 weeks. Flow velocity was adjusted to maximum velocity during continual swimming (initial 43 cm/s). High-speed consecutive photographs revealed that zebrafish mainly drove the caudal part. Additionally, X-ray micro computed tomography measurements indicated muscle hypertrophy of the mid-caudal half compared with the mid-cranial half part. The cross-sectional analysis of the mid-caudal half muscle revealed that skeletal muscle (red, white, or total) mass increased with increasing exercise quantity, whereas that of white muscle and total muscle increased only under the maximum exercise load condition of 6 h/day for 4 weeks. Additionally, the muscle fiver size distributions of exercised fish were larger than those from non-exercised fish. We revealed that exercise quantity, duration/day, and overall duration were correlated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

We postulated that the detoxification capacity of birds is associated with a metabolic cost, given that the organs responsible for detoxification significantly contribute to energetic metabolism. We used an experimental approach to assess the effects of phenol-enriched diets on two passerines with different feeding habits: the omnivorous rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the granivorous common diuca-finch (Diuca diuca). The birds were fed with one of three diets: control diet, supplemented with tannic acid, or supplemented with Opuntia ficus-indica phenolic extract (a common food of the sparrow but not the finch). After 5 weeks of exposure to the diets, we measured basal metabolic rates (BMR), energy intake, glucuronic acid output and digestive and kidney structure. In both species, detoxification capacity expressed as glucuronic acid output was higher in individuals consuming phenol-enriched diets compared to the control diet. However, whereas sparrows increase energy intake and intestinal mass when feeding on phenol-enriched diets, finches had lower intestinal mass and energy intake remains stable. Furthermore, sparrows had higher BMR on phenol-enriched diets compared to the control group, whereas in the finches BMR remains unchanged. Interspecific differences in response to phenols intake may be determined by the dietary habits of these species. While both species can feed on moderate phenolic diets for 5 weeks, energy costs may differ due to different responses in food intake and organ structure to counteract the effects of PSM intake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, mechanisms of such thermogenic improvement at fledging remain undefined. We used two different groups of pre-fledging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) to investigate the specific contribution of cold exposure during water immersion to lipid metabolism. Terrestrial penguins that had never been immersed in cold water were compared with experimentally cold-water immersed juveniles. Experimentally immersed penguins underwent ten successive immersions at approximately 9–10 °C for 5 h over 3 weeks. We evaluated adaptive thermogenesis by measuring body temperature, metabolic rate and shivering activity in fully immersed penguins exposed to water temperatures ranging from 12 to 29 °C. Both never-immersed and experimentally immersed penguins were able to maintain their homeothermy in cold water, exhibiting similar thermogenic activity. In vivo, perfusion of lipid emulsion at thermoneutrality induced a twofold larger calorigenic response in experimentally immersed than in never-immersed birds. In vitro, the respiratory rates and the oxidative phosphorylation efficiency of isolated muscle mitochondria were not improved with cold-water immersions.

The same analyses were conducted in gills of the confamiliar whiting, acclimated at 4 and 10 °C. Branchial Na+/K+ ATPase capacities remained uncompensated at functional and protein levels in NC and NEAC at both acclimation temperatures. Na+/K+ ATPase mRNA expression in NEAC acclimated at 10 °C was about twofold higher compared to NC, indicating some population-specific differentiation at this level. Lower Na+/K+ ATPase capacities in gills of warm-acclimatized sNC at common assay temperatures indicate thermal compensation between seasonal extremes, and post-translational modifications contributed to this mitigation at high assay temperature. Together, cod compensates Na+/K+ ATPase capacities on the warm edge of the thermal window and below 4 °C, respectively. In contrast, whiting Na+/K+ ATPase capacities were cold compensated at 4 °C, supported by 1.5-fold higher mRNA and protein expression. Besides, capacities were lower in whiting compared to NC and NEAC at optimum temperature, which may be advantageous in terms of reduced maintenance cost, but at temperatures ≤4 °C, compensation may represent an energy trade-off to maintain homeostasis.

It is believed to lessen the respiratory acidosis associated with hypercapnia by lowering arterial PCO2, but the contribution of hyperventilation to blood acid–base compensation has yet to be quantified. Hyperventilation may also increase the flux of irons across the gill epithelium and the cost of osmoregulation, owing to the osmo-respiratory compromise. Therefore, hypercapnia exposed fish may increase standard metabolic rate (SMR) leaving less energy for physiological functions such as foraging, migration, growth and reproduction. Here we show that gill ventilation, blood PCO2 and total blood [CO2] increased in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) exposed to 1000 and 5000 µatm water CO2, and that blood PCO2 and total blood [CO2] decrease in fish during hypoxia induced hyperventilation. Based on these results we estimate the ventilatory contributions to total acid–base compensation in 1000 and 5000 µatm water CO2. We find that S. ocellatus only utilize a portion of its ventilatory capacity to reduce the acid–base disturbance in 1000 µatm water CO2. SMR was unaffected by both salinity and hypercapnia exposure indicating that the cost of osmoregulation is small relative to SMR, and that the lack of increased ventilation in 1000 µatm water CO2 despite the capacity to do so is not due to an energetic tradeoff between acid–base balance and osmoregulation. Therefore, while ocean acidification may impact ventilatory parameters, there will be little impact on the overall energy budget of S. ocellatus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The compounds impaired numbers, viability (increased apoptosis) and composition of coelomocytes, and triggered the antioxidant activity of catalase and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase. The natural pathogenic compounds, unlike PMA, strongly activated antioxidative responses that diminished cell apoptosis. Moreover, repeated exposure to the same or different pathogenic compounds did not induce respiratory burst exhausted phenotype showing that coelomocytes are constantly at bay to withstand numerous infections.

We simultaneously measured carotid blood and hypothalamic temperature in four gemsbok, five red hartebeest and six blue wildebeest to assess the extent to which these free-living animals, with varying water dependency, routinely rely on selective brain cooling. We investigated the hypothesis that innate differences in selective brain cooling exist in large, sympatric artiodactyls with varying water dependency. All three species used selective brain cooling, without any discernible differences in three selective brain cooling indices. GLMMs revealed no species differences in the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling (z = 0.79, P = 0.43), the magnitude (z = −0.51, P = 0.61), or the frequency of selective brain cooling use (z = −0.47, P = 0.64), after controlling for carotid blood temperature and black globe temperature. Comparison of anatomical attributes of the carotid retes of the three species revealed that the volume (F2,9 = 5.54, P = 0.03) and height (F2,9 = 5.43, P = 0.03) of the carotid rete, per kilogram body mass, were greater in the red hartebeest than in the blue wildebeest. Nevertheless, intraspecific variability in the magnitude, the frequency of use, and the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling exceeded any interspecific variability in the three indices of selective brain cooling. We conclude that the three species have similar underlying ability to make use of selective brain cooling in an environment with freely available water. It remains to be seen to what extent these three species would rely on selective brain cooling, as a water conservation mechanism, when challenged by aridity, a condition likely to become prevalent throughout much of southern Africa under future climate change scenarios.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This is important in transition dairy cows experiencing negative energy and protein balance postpartum. Overconsumption of energy during late pregnancy affects resting glucose and insulin concentrations peripartum and increases the risk for hyperketonemia postpartum, but the effects on muscle tissue are not fully understood. Skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of insulin-dependent glucose utilization in ruminants. Our objective was to study peripartal skeletal muscle insulin signaling as well as muscle accretion and atrophy in cows with excess energy consumption prepartum. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained 28 and 10 days prepartum, as well as 4 and 21 days postpartum from 24 Holstein cows. Biopsies were taken immediately before and 60 min after intravenous glucose challenge causing endogenous release of insulin. Gene expression of IGF-1, myostatin, and atrogin-1, as well as immunoblot analysis of atrogin-1, muRF1, ubiquitinated proteins, LC3, and phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 was performed. Excess energy consumption in late pregnancy did not lead to changes in insulin-dependent molecular regulation of muscle accretion or atrophy compared with the controlled energy group. In both groups, phosphorylation of AKT and mTORC1 substrate was significantly decreased postpartum whereas proteasome activity and macroautopagy were upregulated.

The present study tested the hypothesis that a similar mechanism is present in Japanese medaka and whether salinity affects ouabain, Mg2+, Na+ and K+ affinity of the gill enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis classified six separate medaka Nka α isoforms (α1a, α1b, α1c, α2, α3a and α3b). Medaka acclimated long-term (>30 days) to either FW or SW had similar gill expression of α1c, α2, α3a and α3b, while both α1a and α1b were elevated in SW. Since a potential isoform shift may rely on early changes in transcript abundance, we conducted two short-term (1–3 days) salinity transfer experiments. FW to SW acclimation induced an elevation of α1b and α1a after 1 and 3 days. SW to FW acclimation reduced α1b after 3 days with no other α isoforms affected. To verify that the responses were typical, additional transport proteins were examined. Gill ncc and nhe3 expression were elevated in FW, while cftr and nkcc1a were up-regulated in SW. This is in accordance with putative roles in ion-uptake and secretion. SW-acclimated medaka had higher gill Nka Vmax and lower apparent Km for Na+ compared to FW fish, while apparent affinities for K+, Mg2+ and ouabain were unchanged. The present study showed that the Japanese medaka does not exhibit a salinity-induced α isoform switch and therefore suggests that Na+ affinity changes involve altered posttranslational modification or intermolecular interactions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This enables them to detect and strike towards warm-blooded prey even in the dark. In addition, the IR sense allows rattlesnakes to find places for thermoregulation. Animate objects (e.g., prey) tend to move and thus cause moving IR images across the pit membrane. Even when an object is stationary, scanning head movements of rattlesnakes will result in moving IR images across the pit membrane. 
We recorded the neuronal activity of IR-sensitive tectal neurons of the rattlesnake Crotalus atrox while stimulating the snakes with an IR source that moved horizontally at various velocities. As long as object velocity was low (angular velocity of ~5°/s) IR-sensitive tectal neurons hardly showed any responses. With increasing object velocity though, neuronal activity reached a maximum at ~50°/s. A further increase in object velocity up to ~120°/s resulted in a slight decrease of neuronal activity. Our results demonstrate the importance of moving stimuli for the snake’s IR detection abilities: in contrast to fast moving objects, stationary or slowly moving objects will not be detected when the snake is motionless, but might be detected by scanning head movements.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Largely unaffected by the scientific spirit of the time, they worked independently of each other in different countries: in Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, Switzerland and the United States of America. In the current literature on spatial cognition these early ant researchers—Victor Cornetz, Felix Santschi, Charles Turner and Rudolf Brun—are barely mentioned. Moreover, it is virtually unknown that the great neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal had also worked on spatial orientation in ants. This general neglect is certainly due to the fact that nearly all these ant researchers were scientific loners, who did their idiosyncratic investigations outside the realm of comparative physiology, neurobiology and the behavioural sciences of the time, and published their results in French, German, and Spanish at rather inaccessible places. Even though one might argue that much of their work resulted in mainly anecdotal evidence, the conceptual approaches of these early ant researchers preempt much of the present-day discussions on spatial representation in animals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The light attracts small arthropod prey to their web-like silk snares. Larvae glow throughout the night and can modulate their bioluminescence in response to sensory input. To better understand light output regulation and its ecological significance, we examined the larvae’s reaction to light exposure, vibration and sound. Exposure to a 5-min light pulse in the laboratory causes larvae to exponentially decrease their light output over 5–10 min until they completely switch off. They gradually return to pre-exposure levels but do not show a rebound. Larvae are most sensitive to ultraviolet light, then blue, green and red. Vibration of the larval snares results in a several-fold increase in bioluminescence over 20–30 s, followed by an exponential return to pre-exposure levels over 15–30 min. Under some conditions, larvae can respond to vibration by initiating bioluminescence when they are not glowing; however, the response is reduced compared to when they are glowing. We propose that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms combine to modulate bioluminescence intensity by regulating biochemical reactions or gating the access of air to the light organ.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

His work did not go unnoticed. Taking over the Chair for Animal Physiology at the University of Cologne in 1963, the sensory side of the cricket communication system moved into the focus of attention. Franz Huber’s students Dieter Möss, Harald Nocke, and Eckehard Eibl pushed research on the cricket peripheral auditory pathway forward, revealing the organisation of the cricket ears, the neuroanatomical projections of their sensory fibres to the central nervous system and their physiological and mechanical response properties. First, extracellular recordings of action potentials from the ascending neurons in the connectives together with John Stout gave insight into the physiological representations of song patterns in the central nervous system, while Dietmar Otto refined the method of electrical brain stimulation (Fig. 2) and together with Wolfram Kutsch provided deeper insight into the descending efferent control of calling, courtship and rivalry songs. These studies turned previous assumptions upside down: Remarkably, they demonstrated that crickets can even sing when the connectives to the brain are severed (Kutsch and Otto 1972). What did this mean? Was the original hypothesis all wrong? Was the central complex not the timer of the song pattern? David Bentley then provided the first intracellular recordings from motoneurons in fictively singing crickets. At the same time, Norbert Elsner explored the acoustic behaviour of grasshoppers, refining the method of electromyogram recordings to perfection and demonstrating the richness of grasshopper motor control of courtship behaviour. These were important achievements and contributions to the field. I had the chance to attend Franz Huber’s very last neurobiology seminar in Cologne, and for the first time encountered his sheer enthusiasm for the field, which was a Let me start this little homage with a song by Josquin Desprez to congratulate Franz Huber on the occasion of his 90th birthday (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62aBOZrqh8). This medieval madrigal praises the enduringly singing cricket, “el grillo è buon cantore”. Its theme accompanied Franz Huber’s entire career as a scientist and mentor, a theme that still challenges ethologists, neurobiologists and geneticists today in their quest to understand the very core of animal behaviour. The explorations of Franz Huber (Fig. 1) as a PhD student in Tübingen included pioneering studies of the brain and the central nervous system of crickets aiming to link the function of neuropils to the insect’s salient singing behaviour (Huber 1955). Were it reflexes or was it the brain that controlled singing? Were the mushroom bodies integrating sensory inputs? Was the central body timing the song pattern? What about the function of the thoracic ganglia and sensory inputs from the wings and the abdomen? These were challenging questions, yet methods were still coarse in those days: Iron Age tools from today’s perspective, a metal pin and a blade. So who would dare to penetrate an insect’s delicate brain with a needle? Franz Huber would, as the problem was clear: How is behaviour rooted in the function of the nervous system? Where in the nervous system are the centres programming and controlling cricket singing? Could he destroy or activate them? Not long after, the singing crickets provided the first answers. Once specific central brain regions were lesioned males sung to exhaustion.

We investigate here the ability of the tropical ant Gigantiops destructor to perform sequential learning and to use size relationships during navigation. Ants were trained to solve a dichotomic six-stage linear maze relying on the apparent width of two vertical landmarks. Each individual ant first learnt to associate a given landmark width to the motor decision of turning right or left to avoid dead-ends independently of a motor routine. When confronted for the first time with a new intermediate-sized pattern, for which no supposed snapshot could have been stored, ants made directional choices indicating that bar width judgments were not absolute but rather relative to the familiar visual patterns seen in the previous chambers. This result demonstrates that ants can generalize relationship rules by interpolating the relative width of a novel stimulus according to visual information kept in spatial working memory. In conclusion, ants can perform conditional discriminations reliably not only when stimuli are simultaneous but also when they are sequential.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Among birds, many studies have shown that tropical species have a slower pace of life than temperate-breeding species. The pace of life has been hypothesized to affect metabolism and, as predicted, tropical birds have lower basal metabolic rates (BMR) than temperate-breeding birds. However, many temperate-breeding Australian passerines belong to lineages that evolved in Australia and share ‘slow’ life-history traits that are typical of tropical birds. We obtained BMR from 30 of these ‘old-endemics’ and ten sympatric species of more recently arrived passerine lineages (derived from Afro-Asian origins or introduced by Europeans) with ‘faster’ life histories. The BMR of ‘slow’ temperate-breeding old-endemics was indistinguishable from that of new-arrivals and was not lower than the BMR of ‘fast’ temperate-breeding non-Australian passerines. Old-endemics had substantially smaller clutches and longer maximal life spans in the wild than new arrivals, but neither clutch size nor maximum life span was correlated with BMR. Our results suggest that low BMR in tropical birds is not functionally linked to their ‘slow pace of life’ and instead may be a consequence of differences in annual thermal conditions experienced by tropical versus temperate species.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In teleost, information regarding this topic is scarce. Here we studied the presence and synthesis of melatonin at the rainbow trout GIT. Different sections of trout GIT (from esophagus to hindgut) were dissected out and assayed for contents of melatonin, serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, as well as for aanat1, aanat2 and hiomt mRNA abundance. A trout group was pinealectomized to evaluate changes in plasma and gut melatonin content. Finally, the daily profile of melatonin and 5-HT content, and aanat1, aanat2 and hiomt mRNA abundance were analyzed in gut of trout kept under normal lighting, and then under constant darkness. Melatonin was detected in all GIT regions with higher concentrations in the muscular wall than in the mucosa, a similar trend to that of 5-HT. In contrast, transcripts of melatonin synthesis enzymes were more abundant in the mucosa. Pinealectomy did not affect melatonin levels in midgut and hindgut either at day or at night. Additionally, no daily rhythms could be defined for melatonin content in gut tissues but increases during late light phase and at midnight occurred. However, aanat1, aanat2 and hiomt mRNA abundance showed clear daily rhythms with peaks at night. These rhythms remained with a 3-h phase advanced peak in fish exposed to constant darkness.

A combination of in vivo and in vitro techniques was used to look at the relative importance of the gills versus the gut in Na+, Cl−, and K+ balance in two closely related erythrinid species: a facultative air-breather, the jeju (Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus) and an obligate water-breather, the traira (Hopliasmalabaricus). The jeju has a well-vascularized physostomous swimbladder, while that in the traira is poorly vascularized, but the gills are much larger. Both species are native to the Amazon and are common in the ion-poor, acidic blackwaters of the Rio Negro. Under fasting conditions, the traira was able to maintain positive net Na+ and Cl− balance in this water, and only slightly negative net K+ balance. However, the jeju was in negative net balance for all three ions and had lower plasma Na+ and Cl− concentrations, despite exhibiting higher branchial Na+,K+ATPase and v-type H+ATPase activities. In the intestine, activities of these same enzymes were also higher in the jeju, and in vitro measurements of net area-specific rates of Na+, Cl−, and K+ absorption, as well as the overall intestinal absorption capacities for these three ions, were far greater than in the traira. When acutely exposed to disturbances in water O2 levels (severe hypoxia ~15 % or hyperoxia ~420 % saturation), gill ionoregulation was greatly perturbed in the traira but less affected in the jeju, which could “escape” the stressor by voluntarily air-breathing.

Ionocytes within the adult gills or larval skin are critical sites for transcellular Ca2+ uptake in teleosts. The ionocytes of zebrafish were found to contain transcellular Ca2+ transporters, epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 2 (PMCA2), and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1b (NCX1b), providing information about the molecular mechanism of transcellular Ca2+ transports mediated by ionocytes in fish. However, more evidence is required to establish whether or not a similar mechanism of transcellular Ca2+ transport also exists in others teleosts. In the present study, ecac, pmca2, and ncx1 were found to be expressed in the branchial ionocytes of tilapia, thereby providing further support for the mechanism of transcellular Ca2+ transport through ionocytes previously proposed for zebrafish. In addition, we also reveal that low Ca2+ water treatment of tilapia stimulates Ca2+ uptake and expression of ecac and cyp11b (the latter encodes a cortisol-synthesis enzyme). Treatment of tilapia with exogenous cortisol (20 mg/l) enhanced both Ca2+ influx and ecac expression. Therefore, increased cyp11b expression is suggested to enhance Ca2+ uptake capacity in tilapia exposed to low Ca2+ water. Furthermore, the application of cortisol receptor antagonists revealed that cortisol may regulate Ca2+ uptake through glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid receptor (GR and/or MR) in tilapia.

Animal body condition refers to the health and physiological state of individuals, and multiple parameters have been proposed to quantify this key concept. Food intake is one of the main determinants of individual body condition and much debate has been generated on how diet relates to body condition. We investigated this relationship in free-living Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata) nestlings sampled at two geographically distant populations in Spain. Nestlings’ main prey consumption was estimated by isotopic analyses. A multi-biomarker approach, including morphometric and blood biochemical measures (i.e. hematocrit, plasma biochemistry and oxidative stress biomarkers), enabled us to integrate all the body condition measures taken. A greater consumption of a preferred prey [i.e. the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)] improved nestling body condition, as indicated by lower levels of cholesterol in plasma, greater activity of enzymes mediating in protein catabolism, higher levels of tocopherol and glutathione, and less glutathione peroxidase activity, which also suggested lower degree of oxidative stress. On the other hand, increased diet diversity was positively correlated with higher levels of oxidized glutathione, which suggests that these nestlings had poorer body condition than those with a higher frequency of preferred prey consumption. Several factors other than diet [i.e. altitude of nesting areas, nestling sex and age, sampling time (before or after midday) and recent food ingestion] had an effect on certain body condition measures. Our study reveals a measurable effect of diet on a predator’s body condition and demonstrates the importance of considering the potential influence of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors when assessing animal body condition.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study focuses on analyzing the role of DNA methylation in aiding natural anoxia tolerance in a champion vertebrate anaerobe, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans).

In heart, 5 h anoxia submergence resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in DNMT3a levels and a significant decrease in MBD1 and MBD2 levels to ~30 % of control values. In white muscle, DNMT3a and DNMT3b increased threefold and MBD1 levels increased by 50 % in response to 5 h anoxia. Total DNMT activity rose by 0.6–2.0-fold in liver and white muscle and likewise global 5mC levels significantly increased in liver and white muscle under 5 and 20 h anoxia.

In a second set of experiments, we observed that the injection of MK212 or WAY 161503 (1 and 3 mg kg−1) significantly increased hypothalamic POMC mRNA abundance. CART mRNA abundance in hypothalamus was enhanced by treatment with MK212 and unaffected by WAY 161503.

This may in part be due to an enhanced cerebral capacity for anaerobic energy production. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by comparing various parameters of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the brain of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) with those in the brains of the ferret (Mustela putorius furo) and mouse (Mus musculus). We found that mRNA and protein expression of lactate dehydrogenase a (LDHA) and lactate dehydrogenase b (LDHB), and also the LDH activity were significantly higher in the ferret brain than in brains of the hooded seal and the mouse (p < 0.0001). No conspicuous differences in the LDHA and LDHB sequences were observed. There was also no difference in the buffering capacities of the brains. Thus, an enhanced capacity for anaerobic energy production likely does not explain the higher hypoxia tolerance of the seal brain. However, the brain of the hooded seal had higher relative levels of LDHB isoenzymes (LDH1 and LDH2) compared to the non-diving mammals. Moreover, immunofluorescence studies showed more pronounced co-localization of LDHB and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the cortex of the hooded seal. Since LDHB isoenzymes primarily catalyze the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, this finding suggests that the contribution of astrocytes to the brain aerobic metabolism is higher in the hooded seal than in non-diving species. The cerebral tolerance of the hooded seal to hypoxia may therefore partly rely on different LDH isoenzymes distribution.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Looking at the physiology of respiration the existence of tracheae plays an important role in spiders with a well-developed tracheal system. Other factors as sex, life time, type of prey capture and the high ability to gain energy anaerobically influence the resting and the active metabolic rate intensely. Most spiders have metabolic rates that are much lower than expected from body mass; but especially those with two pairs of lungs. Males normally have higher resting rates than females; spiders that are less evolved and possess a cribellum have lower metabolic rates than higher evolved species. Freely hunting spiders show a higher energy turnover than spiders hunting with a web. Spiders that live longer than 1 year will have lower metabolic rates than those species that die after 1 year in which development and reproduction must be completed. Lower temperatures and starvation, which most spiders can cope with, will decrease the metabolic rate as well.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

During solo calling, pulse periods gradually changed by up to 15 % over several minutes. Pairs of calling males synchronized their pulses. The pulse rate (10–14 Hz) was considerably faster than the rate of synchronized signal units in other insects (0.5–3 Hz). Within each pulse cycle, males made only small adjustments to their pulse period, leading to regular switches of leader and follower roles. Large-scale timing adjustments only occurred in response to large delays. Stimulation with single pulses had no predictable effect on the timing of the male’s next pulse, resulting in a flat phase response curve. When entrained to a stimulus with a faster pulse period, males briefly interrupted calling; they resumed calling largely synchronized with the stimulus. Throughout the stimulus, males made gradual changes to their pulse period, similar to those during pair calling. After the stimulus ended, pulse periods increased over several minutes, but did not return to their pre-stimulus values. Thus social context and intrinsic state of the males influenced pulse period in Neoconocephalus ensiger. These results indicate that N. ensiger males synchronize calls by adjusting their intrinsic pulse period, instead of adjusting the timing of individual pulses, as described in other synchronizing insects.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, while the biomechanics of take-off in frogs have been studied in detail, much less is known on how frogs land after a jump. Besides terrestrial and aquatic species, several lineages of frogs adopted an arboreal lifestyle and especially the biomechanics of landing on challenging, small, and unpredictable substrates, such as leaves or branches, are virtually unknown. Here we studied the landing kinematics of the arboreal frog Trachycephalus resinifictrix (Hylidae) on a wooden stick that was used to mimic a small tree branch. We observed two different landing behaviours: (1) landing on the abdomen and (2) attachment with the toes of either the forelimb or the hindlimb. In the latter case, the frogs performed a cartwheel around the stick, while they were only attached by their adhesive toe pads. We estimated the forces that act on the toes during this behaviour to be up to fourteen times the body weight of the animals. This behaviour demonstrates the remarkable adhesive capabilities of the toe pads and the body control of the frogs.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, within seasons, animals should balance their energy budgets as abiotic conditions change, sometimes unpredictably; cold spells should increase heat production, while warm spells should do the opposite. Therefore, we addressed specific questions about the possible interactions between seasonal acclimatization and the intra-seasonal phenotypic flexibility of metabolic rate. We hypothesized that phenotypic flexibility in small mammals differs seasonally and is greater in summer than in winter, and predicted that seasonal adjustments in energetics, which are driven by photoperiod, overwhelm the influence of variations in the thermal environment. We measured body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), facultative non-shivering thermogenesis (fNST), body temperature, and calculated minimum thermal conductance in Siberian hamsters Phodopus sungorus. Animals were acclimated to winter-like, and then to summer-like conditions and, within each season, were exposed twice, for 3 weeks to 10, 20 or 28 °C. We used differences between values measured after these short acclimation periods as a measure of the scope of phenotypic flexibility. After winter acclimation, hamsters were lighter, had lower whole animal BMR, higher fNST than in summer, and developed heterothermy. After these short acclimations to the above-mentioned temperatures, hamsters showed reversible changes in BMR and fNST; however, these traits were less flexible in winter than in summer. We conclude that seasonal acclimation affects hamster responses to intra-seasonal variations in the thermal environment. We argue that understanding seasonal changes in phenotypic flexibility is crucial for predicting the biological consequences of global climate changes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The primary distance cue is the delay between the bat’s emitted echolocation pulse and the return of an echo. In the bat’s auditory system, echo delay-tuned neurons that only respond to pulse–echo pairs having a specific echo delay serve target distance calculation. Accurate prey localization should benefit from the spike precision in such neurons. Here we show that delay-tuned neurons in the inferior colliculus of the mustached bat respond with higher temporal precision, shorter latency and shorter response duration than those of the auditory cortex. Based on these characteristics, we suggest that collicular neurons are best suited for a fast and accurate response that could lead to fast behavioral reactions while cortical neurons, with coarser temporal precision and longer latencies and response durations could be more appropriate for integrating acoustic information over time. The latter could be important for the formation of biosonar images.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Our understanding of the visual pigment diversity of larval stomatopods, however, is based on four species, which severely limits our understanding of stomatopod eye ontogeny. To investigate several poorly understood aspects of stomatopod larval eye function, we tested two hypotheses surrounding the spectral absorption of larval visual pigments. First, we examined a broad range of species to determine if stomatopod larvae generally express a single, spectral class of photoreceptor. Using microspectrophotometry (MSP) on larvae captured in the field, we found data which further support this long-standing hypothesis. MSP was also used to test whether larval species from the same geographical region express visual pigments with similar absorption spectra. Interestingly, despite occupation of the same geographical location, we did not find evidence to support our second hypothesis. Rather, there was significant variation in visual pigment absorption spectra among sympatric species. These data are important to further our understanding of larval photoreceptor spectral diversity, which is beneficial to ongoing investigations into the ontogeny, physiology, and molecular evolution of stomatopod eyes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

While the impact of acute hypercarbia exposure on the behavior and physiology of fishes has been well studied, relatively little work has examined the physiological impact and acclimation capacity of fishes to chronic hypercarbia. To better understand the impacts of prolonged hypercarbia exposure, largemouth bass were held at ambient CO2 (13 mg L−1) and elevated CO2 (31 mg L−1; ≈21,000 µatm) for 58 days. Following this acclimation period, fish were subjected to three separate, yet complementary, experiments: (1) acute hypercarbia challenge of 120 mg L−1 CO2 for 1 h to quantify physiological and molecular responses; (2) hypercarbia avoidance challenge to compare CO2 agitation and avoidance responses; and (3) swim performance challenge to quantify burst swimming performance. Acclimation to 31 mg L−1 CO2 resulted in a significant constitutive upregulation of c-fos expression in erythrocytes, combined with significant constitutive expression of hsp70 in both gill and erythrocytes, relative to controls. Largemouth bass acclimated to elevated CO2 also had a reduced glucose response (relative to controls) following an acute CO2 exposure, indicating a reduced stress response to CO2 stressors. In addition, largemouth bass acclimated to elevated CO2 conditions required 50 % higher CO2 concentrations to illicit agitation behaviors and displayed prolonged burst swimming abilities in high CO2 environments relative to controls. Together, results demonstrate that largemouth bass exposed to chronic hypercarbia may possess a physiological advantage during periods of elevated CO2 relative to naïve fish, which may permit increased performance in hypercarbia.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

He enjoyed exploring nature’s biological systems with a physics toolbox, quantifying and making sense of its complexity. Matti’s infectious enthusiasm and determination to improve biophysics research and teaching in Finland made the University of Oulu its major seat of learning in Finland. Matti was an accomplished and talented researcher, who was comfortable with both experiments and theory, and driven by his inherent curiosity. His research was at the interface of physiology, neuroethology, and biophysics, and most often focussed upon how the visual world is encoded into neural signals within the eye. He used different microelectrode techniques to record and characterise electrical response properties and signalling performance of individual photoreceptor cells and visual interneurones in many different insect species. A key early breakthrough in his research involved the first characterisation of voltagesensitive potassium channels in graded potential neurones in insect eyes. In his most recent, and ongoing studies he pioneered the development of patch-clamp preparations from photoreceptors of numerous and ecologically diverse insect species, with the goal of understanding how membrane conductances (such as light-sensitive channels and voltage-sensitive K channels) were tuned to visual performance. Matti was also involved in studying the biophysical properties of mammalian heart cells and their electromechanical functions.

Neonatal chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) are highly sensitive to cold exposure, because their capacity for thermogenesis is immature until 1 week after hatching. Hence, we hypothesized that the heart of chicks at around 1 week of age acutely responds to cold environment. To investigate the effect of acute (24 h) and long-term (2 weeks) cold on the heart of chicks, 7-day-old chicks were exposed to cold temperature (4 °C) or kept warm (30 °C). Chicks exposed to the cold showed cardiac hypertrophy with marked left ventricular (LV) chamber dilation and wall thickening. On the other hand, long-term cold exposure (2 weeks from 7-day-old) induced an increase in total ventricular mass, but not in LV morphological parameters. Then, we investigated the details of acute cardiac hypertrophy in chicks. Electron microscopy revealed that cardiomyocytes in the hypertrophied LV had enlarged mitochondria with less dense cristae. Although the mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase in the LV of the cold-exposed chicks significantly increased, the mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation did not change in response to cold exposure. In addition, the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, which enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and function under physiological cardiac hypertrophy, increased in LV of cold-exposed chicks.

Typically, the honey bee (Apis mellifera) shows a pronounced reproductive division of labour between worker and queen castes, and a clear division of colony roles among workers. In a queenless condition, however, both of these aspects of social organisation break down. Queenless workers reproduce, forage and maintain their colony operating in a manner similar to communal bees, rather than as an advanced eusocial group. This plasticity in social organisation provides a natural experiment for exploring physiological mechanisms of division of labour. We measured brain biogenic amine (BA) levels and abdominal fat body vitellogenin gene expression levels of workers in queenright and queenless colonies. Age, ovary activation and social environment influenced brain BA levels in honey bees. BA levels were most influenced by ovary activation state in queenless bees. Vitellogenin expression levels were higher in queenless workers than queenright workers, but in both colony environments vitellogenin expression was lower in foragers than non-foragers. We propose this plasticity in the interacting signalling systems that influence both reproductive and behavioural development allows queenless workers to deviate significantly from the typical worker bee reaction norm and develop as reproductively active behavioural generalists.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Larvae, nymphs, and adults under potential diapause-inducing conditions (short day, 20 °C) have low water loss rates compared to long day exposed ticks. Above the critical equilibrium activity, these nonfed ticks show greater water gain from lower water vapor activities. In contrast to nonfed stages, eggs and blood-engorged stages (fed larva, fed nymph) were enhanced for water conservation independent of short day exposure and did not display reduced water loss rates under short day conditions. This short day-prompted response in nonfed ticks was distinguished from a genetically programmed diapause as noted in other arthropods by: (1) reduction in water loss was temporary and could be reversed quickly by transferring to long day for only a single day, then re-triggered by returning to short day conditions; (2) switch between low and high water loss rates could be induced multiple times and for multiple different stages; and (3) response by ticks was to the photoperiod they were under, not the condition that was experienced by previous fed stages or in the mother in the case of eggs. Furthermore, short day had no impact on altering body water content, dehydration tolerance limit, instar yields, or developmental stadia. We conclude that a short day-triggered quiescence reduces desiccation stress associated with overwintering in nonfed ticks. This effect on water conservation due to short day exposure is more pronounced for subadults and is likely due to their increased sensitivity to water loss as a result of their smaller size, which is critical to prevent dehydration during the dry winter periods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To elucidate the regulation of these behavioral changes in L. hesperus, biogenic amines were quantified in the heads of females at 5 min, 1 h and 24 h after copulation and compared to levels in virgins using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection. Mating significantly increased dopamine (DA) after 1 and 24 h, and decreased octopamine (OA) after 5 min and 1 h. Serotonin did not change with mating, but tyramine was significantly reduced after 5 min. While injection of amines into virgin females did not influence sexual receptivity, OA caused a decrease in oviposition during the 24 h following injection. Topical application of the JH analog methoprene to virgins caused an increase in DA, and a decline in mating propensity, but did not influence other amines or the oviposition rate. The results suggest the decline in OA observed immediately after mating may promote egg laying, and that male-derived JH may induce an increase in DA that could account for the post-mating loss of sexual receptivity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this sense, the knowledge of an organism’s sensitivity to temperature variation is essential to predict potential responses to climate warming. In particular, it is interesting to know how close species are to their thermal limits in nature and whether physiological plasticity is a potential short-term response to warming climates. We exposed Liolaemus pictus lizards, from northern Patagonia, to either 21 or 31 °C for 30 days to compare the effects of these treatments on thermal sensitivity in 1 and 0.2 m runs, preferred body temperature (Tpref), panting threshold (Tpant), and critical minimum temperature (CTMin). Furthermore, we measured the availability of thermal microenvironments (operative temperatures; Te) to measure how close L. pictus is, in nature, to its optimal locomotor performance (To) and thermal limits. L. pictus showed limited physiological plasticity, since the acclimation temperature (21 and 31 °C) did not affect the locomotor performance nor did it affect Tpref, the Tpant, or the CTMin. The mean Te was close to To and was 17 °C lower than the CTMax. The results suggest that L. pictus, in a climate change scenario, could be vulnerable to the predicted temperature increment, as this species currently lives in an environment with temperatures close to their highest locomotor temperature threshold, and because they showed limited acclimation capacity to adjust to new thermal conditions by physiological plasticity. Nevertheless, L. pictus can run at 80 % or faster of its maximum speed across a wide range of temperatures near To, an ability which would attenuate the impact of global warming.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The gasotransmitters control several physiological functions in fish by acting as intracellular signaling molecules. Hydrogen sulphide, first implicated in vasomotor control in fish, plays a critical role in oxygen chemoreception owing to its production and downstream effects within the oxygen chemosensory cells, the neuroepithelial cells. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that hydrogen sulphide may contribute to oxygen sensing in both fish and mammals by promoting membrane depolarization of the chemosensory cells. Unlike hydrogen sulphide which stimulates breathing in zebrafish, carbon monoxide inhibits ventilation in goldfish and zebrafish whereas nitric oxide stimulates breathing in zebrafish larvae while inhibiting breathing in adults. Gasotransmitters also modulate ionic uptake in zebrafish. Though nothing is known about the role of CO, reduced activities of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase activities in the presence of NO donors suggest an inhibitory role of NO in fish osmoregulation.

However, currently used indicators of stress show significant interspecific and intraspecific variation in species’ physiological responses and tolerances to capture. To improve our understanding of chondrichthyan stress physiology and potentially reduce variation when quantifying the stress response, we investigated the use of the adenylate energy charge (AEC); a measure of available metabolic energy. To determine tissues sensitive to metabolic stress, we extracted samples of the brain, heart, liver, white muscle and blood from gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) immediately following gillnet capture and after 3 h recovery under laboratory conditions. Capture caused significant declines in liver, white muscle and blood AEC, whereas no decline was detected in the heart and brain AEC. Following 3 h of recovery from capture, the AEC of the liver and blood returned to “unstressed” levels (control values) whereas white muscle AEC was not significantly different to that immediately after capture. Our results show that the liver is most sensitive to metabolic stress and white muscle offers a practical method to sample animals non-lethally for determination of the AEC. The AEC is a highly informative indicator of stress and unlike current indicators, it can directly measure the change in available energy and thus the metabolic stress experienced by a given tissue. Cellular metabolism is highly conserved across organisms and, therefore, we think the AEC can also provide a standardised form of measuring capture stress in many chondrichthyan species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The knowledge about anatomy and function of the medfly olfactory system is still limited. The first brain structure to process olfactory information in insects is the antennal lobe (AL), which is composed of its functional and morphological units, the olfactory glomeruli. Here, we present a morphological three-dimensional reconstruction of AL glomeruli in adult brains. We used unilateral antennal backfills of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) with neural tracers, revealing the AL structure. We recorded confocal stacks acquired from whole-mount specimens, and analyzed them with the software AMIRA. The ALs in C. capitata are organized in glomeruli which are more tightly packed in the anterior part than the posterior one. Axons of ORNs bilaterally connect the ALs through a commissure between the two ALs. This commissure is formed by several distinct fascicles. Contralateral dye transfer suggests the presence of gap junctions connecting ORNs from both antennae. There was no statistical difference between the average volumes of female ALs (204,166 ± 12,554 μm3) and of male ALs (190,287 ± 11,823 μm3).

Remarkably, the social paper wasp Polistes fuscatus has recently been discovered to possess this ability, which is useful for remembering identities during competitive social interactions. We analyzed brain gene expression in staged encounters between pairs of individuals to explore potential mechanisms underlying wasps’ ability to recall familiar individuals using real-time qRT-PCR. We identified four candidate genes (IP3K, IP3R, Nckx30C and Su(var)2-10) that were down-regulated in the presence of familiar individuals compared to single wasps and pairs of wasps meeting for the first time. These candidate genes are related to calcium signaling, therefore, we treated wasps with lithium chloride, a pharmacological agent that inhibits calcium signaling in neurons. This treatment decreased aggression in paper wasps, but did not affect expression of genes related to calcium signaling. The results suggest calcium signaling differences may be related to individual memory recall in wasps, and we present four promising candidate genes for future study. These data suggest genes associated with dominance behavior may be co-opted for individual recognition, but further work is needed to establish a causal association with the behavior.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, such studies are often attempted on captive populations alone, delivering limited data. One such example is the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, for which contradicting observational data exist between captive and free-ranging populations, while hormonal analyses have only been obtained from a single captive population. To extend and rectify the limited information, we monitored faecal progestagen and oestrogen metabolite levels across various important life history stages of both captive and free-ranging G. moholi.

In mammals, intracellular taurine modulates cardiac Ca2+ handling and carbohydrate metabolism at much lower concentrations but it is not clear if it exerts similar actions in cephalopods. Blood Ca2+ levels are high in cephalopods and we hypothesized that taurine would depress cardiac Ca2+ flux and modulate contractility in systemic and branchial hearts of cuttlefish. Heart performance was assessed with an in situ perfused systemic heart preparation and contractility was evaluated using isometrically contracting systemic and branchial heart muscle rings. Stroke volume, cardiac output, and Ca2+ sensitivity were significantly lower in systemic hearts perfused with supplemental taurine (100 mmol L−1) than in controls. In muscle ring preparations, taurine impaired relaxation at high contraction frequencies, an effect abolished by supra-physiological Ca2+ levels. Taurine did not affect oxygen consumption in non-contracting systemic heart muscle, but extracellular glucose utilization was twice that of control preparations. Collectively, our results suggest that extracellular taurine depresses cardiac Ca2+ flux and potentiates glucose utilization in cuttlefish.

Flying animals are capable of navigating through environments of different complexity with high precision. To control their flight when negotiating narrow tunnels, bees and birds use the magnitude of apparent image motion (known as optic flow) generated by the walls. In their natural habitat, however, these animals would encounter both cluttered and open environments. Here, we investigate how large changes in the proximity of nearby surfaces affect optic flow-based flight control strategies. We trained bumblebees to fly along a flight and recorded how the distance between the walls—from 60 cm to 240 cm—affected their flight control. Our results reveal that, as tunnel width increases, both lateral position and ground speed become increasingly variable. We also find that optic flow information from the ground has an increasing influence on flight control, suggesting that bumblebees measure optic flow flexibly over a large lateral and ventral field of view, depending on where the highest magnitude of optic flow occurs. A consequence of this strategy is that, when flying in narrow spaces, bumblebees use optic flow information from the nearby obstacles to control flight, while in more open spaces they rely primarily on optic flow cues from the ground.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Temporally selective neurons in the anuran inferior colliculus may contribute to selective behavioral responses to these calls. Here we present in vivo extracellular and whole-cell recordings from long-interval-selective neurons (LINs) made during presentation of pulses that varied in shape and rate. Whole-cell recordings revealed that interplay between excitation and inhibition shapes long-interval selectivity. LINs in H. versicolor showed greater selectivity for slow-rise pulses, consistent with the slow-rise pulse characteristics of their calls. The steepness of pulse-rate tuning functions, but not the distributions of best pulse rates, differed between the species in a manner that depended on whether pulses had slow or fast-rise shape. When tested with stimuli representing the temporal structure of the advertisement calls of H. chrysoscelis or H. versicolor, approximately 27 % of LINs in H. versicolor responded exclusively to the latter stimulus type. The LINs of H. chrysoscelis were less selective. Encounter calls, which are produced at similar pulse rates in both species (≈5 pulses/s), are likely to be effective stimuli for the LINs of both species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested the specificity by playing their distress call and its modified version at a foraging site for free-ranging bats, as well as under captive conditions involving either a small group or individuals. In a separate playback experiment, bats showed a significantly greater response when the natural call as opposed to a modified call was played back to captive as well as free-ranging bats at the foraging site. Under captive conditions, bats showed less of a response to the playback of distress calls when in a group than when alone. We subsequently found that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and its transcription factor—nuclear receptor related factor 1 (Nurr-1); and the dopamine transporter (DAT) and its receptor (D1DR) were elevated significantly in the amygdala of bats both emitting and responding to a distress call, but not in the case of bats responding to the modified call.

Sex steroid profiles were similar between males and females, with only circulating progesterone levels significantly different between the sexes (female > male). Circulating pregnenolone levels were high in both sexes, suggesting that pregnenolone might serve as a circulating prohormone for local steroid synthesis in zebra finches. Furthermore, circulating testosterone levels were extremely low in both sexes. Additionally, we found no correlations between circulating steroid levels and pair-maintenance behavior.

To quantify how hoverfly activity depends on internal and external factors, we here utilize a locomotor activity monitoring system. We show that Eristalis hoverflies are active during the entire light period when exposed to a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle, with a lower activity if exposed to light during the night. We show that the hoverflies’ locomotor activity is stable over their lifetime and that it does not depend on the diet provided. Surprisingly, we find no difference in activity between males and females, but the activity is significantly affected by the sex of an accompanying conspecific. Finally, we show that female hoverflies are more resilient to starvation than males.

For insects, this is often evident in the optical array of the compound eye. One behaviour that insects share with many animals is the use of learnt visual information for navigation. As ants are expert visual navigators it may be that their vision is optimised for navigation. Here we take a computational approach in asking how the details of the optical array influence the informational content of scenes used in simple view matching strategies for orientation. We find that robust orientation is best achieved with low-resolution visual information and a large field of view, similar to the optical properties seen for many ant species. A lower resolution allows for a trade-off between specificity and generalisation for stored views. Additionally, our simulations show that orientation performance increases if different portions of the visual field are considered as discrete visual sensors, each giving an independent directional estimate. This suggests that ants might benefit by processing information from their two eyes independently.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In African clawed frogs, Xenopus, this information is conveyed by vocal signals that differ in temporal patterns and spectral features between sexes and across species. We characterized spectral sensitivity using auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs), commonly known as the auditory brainstem response, in males and females of four Xenopus species. In female X. amieti, X. petersii, and X. laevis, peripheral auditory sensitivity to their species own dyad—two, species-specific dominant frequencies in the male advertisement call—is enhanced relative to males. Males were most sensitive to lower frequencies including those in the male-directed release calls. Frequency sensitivity was influenced by endocrine state; ovariectomized females had male-like auditory tuning while dihydrotestosterone-treated, ovariectomized females maintained female-like tuning. Thus, adult, female Xenopus demonstrate an endocrine-dependent sensitivity to the spectral features of conspecific male advertisement calls that could facilitate mating. Xenopus AEPs resemble those of other species in stimulus and level dependence, and in sensitivity to anesthetic (MS222). AEPs were correlated with body size and sex within some species.

Eggs and tadpoles from the southern invasion front tolerated the most saline conditions we found in potential spawning ponds during surveys [equivalent to 1200 ppm (3.5 % the salinity of seawater)]. Indeed, high-salinity treatments increased tadpole body sizes, accelerated metamorphosis, and improved locomotor ability of metamorphs (but did not affect metamorph morphology). At very low salinity [40 ppm (0.1 % seawater)], eggs hatched but larvae did not develop past Gosner stage 37.

Only recently it has become evident that hemocyanins also occur in Remipedia and Ostracoda. Here we report for the first time the identification and characterisation of hemocyanin in the fish louse Argulus, which belongs to the class of Branchiura. This finding indicates that hemocyanin was the principal oxygen carrier in the stem lineage of the pancrustaceans, but has been lost independently multiple times in crustacean taxa. We obtained the full-length cDNA sequences of two hemocyanin subunits of Argulus foliaceus by a combination of RT-PCR, RACE and Illumina sequencing of the transcriptome. In addition, one full-length and one partial cDNA sequence were derived from the transcriptome data of Argulus siamensis. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of at least two hemocyanin subunits in A. foliaceus, which are expressed at the mRNA level at a 1:3.5 ratio. The addition to the branchiuran hemocyanin subunits to a multiple sequence alignment of arthropod, hemocyanins improved the phylogenetic resolution within the pancrustacean hemocyanins. Malacostracan, ostracod and branchiuran hemocyanins are distinct from the hexapod and remipede hemocyanins, reinforcing the hypothesis of a close relationship of Remipedia and Hexapoda.

The gaps showed more jitter across song renditions than did notes. Gaps had longer duration in branching points of song sequence than in stereotypic transitions, and the duration of a gap was correlated with the duration of the note that preceded the gap. When looking at the variation among song renditions, we found notable factors in three time ranges: within-day drift, within-bout changes, and local jitter. Note durations shortened over time from morning to evening. Within each song bout note durations lengthened as singing progressed, while gap durations lengthened only during the late part of song bout. Further analysis after removing these drift factors confirmed that the jitter remained in local song sequences. These results suggest distinct sources of temporal variability exist at multiple levels on the basis of this note–gap relationship, and that song comprised a mixture of these sources.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Regulation of CAc abundance and activity therefore is expected to fine-tune responses to ionic or acid–base challenges. The present study investigated the potential for gill CAc of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchusmykiss (tCAc), to undergo reversible phosphorylation. The activity of tCAc was approximately doubled by phosphorylation achieved through in vitro stimulation of endogenous protein kinases; kinase stimulation doubled phospho-threonine content from that observed in tCAc isolated under conditions where both kinases and protein phosphatases were inhibited. In vitro incubation to preferentially stimulate specific kinases implicated protein kinase G (PKG) in mediating the increase in tCAc activity. The kinetic parameters of turnover number (kcat) and substrate affinity (Km) were similarly affected by stimulation of either kinase or phosphatase action. However, phosphorylation via kinase stimulation significantly increased the efficiency of tCAc (Vmax/Km), and this factor may have contributed to the elevation of tCAc activity. In addition, phosphorylation of tCAc by kinase stimulation significantly increased the inhibition constant (Ki) for acetazolamide. These results demonstrate that tCAc is subject to reversible phosphorylation; future work should focus on identifying the physiological situation(s) in which phosphorylation of trout branchial CAc occurs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The response of the anterior tympanal membrane is nonlinear, exhibiting a lack of tuning at high amplitudes (60 dB and above) but as stimulus amplitude decreases, the membrane becomes tuned to around 4.3 kHz. The tuning of the membrane falls within the frequency range of male calls indicating sender–receiver matching at low amplitudes, which could aid localisation of the highly directional calls of males.

Specifically, fish exposed to 14 days of 1000 µatm CO2 had a 32 % reduction in branchial diffusion distance and increased expression of two putative CO2 channel proteins—rhag and rhcg1. No changes were observed in the erythrocyte CO2 transport pathways. Surprisingly, no significant changes in blood chemistry were observed between acclimated and acutely challenged animals; however, a non-significant 30 % drop in the magnitude of plasma $$C_{{{\text{CO}}_{ 2} }}$$CCO2 elevation was observed. Reduced diffusion distance also comes with the cost of increased diffusive water loss, which would require greater osmoregulatory investment by the animal. OA exposure induced increased gill Na+, K+ ATPase activity and intestinal nkcc2 expression, supporting both the presumed osmotic stress and increased osmoregulatory investment. However, no differences in standard metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate or aerobic scope were detected between control and OA acclimated individuals. Similarly, no differences in critical swim speed were detected between groups, suggesting the energetic cost related to respiratory plasticity is negligible against background metabolism. The current study demonstrated that red drum exhibit respiratory plasticity with only mild physiological trade-offs; however, this plasticity is insufficient to fully offset the OA-induced acid–base disturbance and as such is unlikely to impact species resilience.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In other animal models platelets, neutrophils, monocytes and von Willebrand factor (VWF) have been found in DVT. Previous research has shown that hibernating mammals decrease their levels of platelets and clotting factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), increasing both bleeding time and activated partial thromboplastin time. In this study, FVIII, FIX and VWF activities and mRNA levels were measured in torpid and non-hibernating ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Here, we show that VWF high molecular weight multimers, collagen-binding activity, lung mRNA and promoter activity decrease during torpor. The VWF multimers reappear in plasma within 2 h of arousal in the spring. Similarly, FIX activity and liver mRNA both dropped threefold during torpor. In contrast, FVIII liver mRNA levels increased twofold while its activity dropped threefold, consistent with a post-transcriptional decrease in FVIII stability in the plasma due to decreased VWF levels. Finally, both neutrophils and monocytes are decreased eightfold during torpor which could slow the formation of DVT. In addition to providing insight in how blood clotting can be regulated to allow mammals to survive in extreme environments, hibernating ground squirrels provide an interesting model for studying.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, our understanding of the effects of temperature on the dynamics of interactions between species is largely inadequate. Inducible defences persist in prey populations because defensive traits increase survival in the presence of predators but are costly when they are absent. Large-scale changes in the thermal climate are likely to alter the costs or benefits of these defences for ectotherms, whose physiological processes are driven by environmental temperature. A shift in costs of defensive traits would affect not only predator–prey interactions, but also the strength of selection for inducible defences in natural populations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the costs of behavioural defences in larvae of the marine toad, Rhinella marinus. Larvae were reared in the presence or absence of predator cues at both 25 and 30 °C. When exposed to predation cues, larvae reduced activity and spent less time feeding. Exposure to predation cues also reduced metabolic rate, presumably as a by-product of reducing activity levels. Larvae exposed to predation cues also grew more slowly, were smaller at metamorphosis and were poorer jumpers after metamorphosis—three traits associated with fitness in post-metamorphic anurans. We found that the costs of behavioural defences, in terms of larval growth, post-metamorphic size and jumping performance, were exacerbated at cooler temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of costs associated with defensive traits may explain geographic variation in plasticity of defensive traits in other species and suggests that changes in environmental temperature associated with climate change may affect predator–prey interactions in subtle ways not previously considered.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, the full-length cDNA of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase c isoform of G. przewalskii (GpCAc) was amplified and sequenced; mRNA levels and enzyme activity of GpCAc and blood chemistry were evaluated to understand the compensatory responses as the naked carp returned to the saline-alkaline lake after spawning. We found that GpCAc had a total length of 1400 bp and encodes a peptide of 260 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analysis showed that GpCAc was a member of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II-like c family. Cytosolic-carbonic-anhydrase-c-specific primers were used to analyze the tissue distribution of GpCAc mRNA expression. Expression of GpCAc mRNA was found in brain, gill, liver, kidney, gut, and muscle tissues, but primarily in the gill and posterior kidney; however, none was evident in red blood cells. Transferring fish from river water to lake water resulted in a respiratory alkalosis, osmolality, and ion rise in the blood, as well as significant decreases in the expression and enzyme activity of GpCAc in both the gill and kidney within 96 h. These results indicate that GpCAc may play an important role in the acclimation to both high salinity and carbonate alkalinity. Specifically, G. przewalskii decreases cytosolic carbonic anhydrase c expression to compensate for a respiratory alkalosis and to aid in osmoregulation during the transition from river to saline-alkaline lake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Long-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors, comprised of microvilli from R1–7 cells, make up the main rhabdoms. Eighth retinular cells, located distal to the main rhabdoms, house short-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors. While the opsin involved in long-wavelength sensitivity has long been known, we present the first description of the short-wavelength-sensitive opsin in the retina of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. The expression patterns of these SWS and LWS opsin proteins in the retina are consistent with the previously described locations of SWS and LWS receptors. Crayfish also have a well-characterized extraocular photoreceptor, called the caudal photoreceptor, located in the sixth abdominal ganglion. To search for retinal opsins in the caudal photoreceptor (and elsewhere in the CNS), we used RT-PCR and immunohistochemical labeling. We found both SWS and LWS opsin transcripts not only in the sixth abdominal ganglion, but also in all ganglia of the nerve cord. Immunolabeling shows that both opsins are expressed in nerve fibers that extend from the brain through the entire length of the CNS. Thus, the same two photopigments are used both for vision in the retina and for extraocular functions throughout the CNS of crayfish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Peak ICa density at 5 °C (−1.1 ± 0.1 pA pF−1) was 1/8th that at 15 °C (−8.8 ± 0.6 pA pF−1). However, alterations of the Ca2+- and voltage-dependent inactivation properties of L-type Ca2+ channels partially compensated against the decrease. The time constant tau (τ) for the kinetics of inactivation of ICa was ~4.5 times greater at 5 °C than at 15 °C, and the voltage for half-maximal inactivation was shifted from −23.3 ± 1.0 mV at 15 °C to −19.8 ± 1.2 mV at 5 °C. These modifications increase the open probability of the channel and culminate in an approximate doubling of the L-type Ca2+ window current, which contributes to approximately 15 % of the maximal Ca2+ conductance at 5 °C. Consequently, the charge density of ICa (QCa) and the total Ca2+ transferred through the L-type Ca2+ channels (Δ[Ca2+]) were not as severely reduced at 5 °C as compared to peak ICa density. In combination, the results suggest that while the Alaska blackfish substantially down-regulates ICa with acclimation to low temperature, there is sufficient compensation in the kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ channel to support the level of cardiac performance required for the fish to remain active throughout the winter.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

 which to study cardiac physiology and development. Progress has been made in understanding the role of endogenous compounds in regulating cardiac function in this model. It is well characterized that common neurotransmitters act on many peripheral and non-neuronal tissues as they flow through the hemolymph of insects. Many of these neuromodulators, including acetylcholine (ACh), have been shown to act directly on the D. melanogaster larval heart. ACh is a primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates and at the neuromuscular junctions on skeletal and cardiac tissue. In insects, ACh is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of sensory neurons and is also prominent in the CNS. A full understanding regarding the regulation of the Drosophila cardiac physiology by the cholinergic system remains poorly understood. Here we use semi-intact D. melanogaster larvae to study the pharmacological profile of cholinergic receptor subtypes, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), in modulating heart rate (HR). Cholinergic receptor agonists, nicotine and muscarine both increase HR, while nAChR agonist clothianidin exhibits no significant effect when exposed to an open preparation at concentrations as low as 100 nM. In addition, both nAChR and mAChR antagonists increase HR as well but also display capabilities of blocking agonist actions. These results provide evidence that both of these receptor subtypes display functional significance in regulating the larval heart’s pacemaker activity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The two putative amino acid sequences were compared with Prdx6 orthologs from other fish, highlighting a high percentage of identity and similarity with the respective variant, in particular for the residues that are essential for the characteristic peroxidase and phospholipase activities of these enzymes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the appearance of the two prdx6 genes through a duplication event before the speciation that led to the differentiation of fish families and that the evolution of the two gene variants seems to proceed together with the evolution of fish orders and families. The temporal expression of Prdx6 mRNA in response to short-term thermal stress showed a general upregulation of prdx6b and inhibition of prdx6a, suggesting that the latter is the variant most affected by temperature increase. The variations of mRNA accumulation are more conspicuous in heart than the liver, probably related to behavioral changes of the specimens in response to elevated temperature. These data, together with the peculiar differences between the molecular structures of the two Prdx6s in T. bernacchii as well as in the tropical species Stegastes partitus, suggest an adaptation that allowed these poikilothermic aquatic vertebrates to colonize very different environments, characterized by different temperature ranges.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This work investigates the role of glucocorticoids as modulators of clock genes expression in the liver of goldfish. In fish maintained under a 12L:12D photoperiod, an intraperitoneal injection at Zeitgeber Time 2 of a glucocorticoid analog, dexamethasone (1 μg/g body weight) induced per1 genes while decreased gbmal1a and gclock1a expression in the liver at 8 h post-injection. A 4-h in vitro exposure of goldfish liver to cortisol (0.1–10 μM) also induced gper1 genes in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, the exposure of the goldfish cultured liver to dexamethasone produced a concentration-dependent induction of gper1 genes. Moreover, this glucocorticoid analog led to a decrease in gbmal1a and gclock1a transcripts, while the other clock genes analyzed were unaffected. The induction of gper1a and gper1b by dexamethasone in vitro was observed at short times (2 h), whereas the reductions of gbmal1a and gclock1a transcripts needed longer exposure times (8 h) to the glucocorticoid to be significant. Additionally, a 2-h exposure to dexamethasone in the liver culture was enough to extend the induction of per genes for more than 12 h. Present results indicate that gper1 genes are targets for glucocorticoids in the regulation of goldfish hepatic oscillator, as previously reported in mammals, suggesting a conserved role of glucocorticoids in the functional organization of the peripheral circadian system in vertebrates. The repression of clock1a and bmal1a is not so well established, and suggests that other clock genes could be glucocorticoid targets in the goldfish liver.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To investigate how some organisms might be able to developmentally compensate for increasing turbidity, we reared guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in either clear or turbid water. We assessed the effects of developmental treatments on adult behavior and aspects of the visual system by testing fish from both developmental treatments in turbid and clear water. We found a strong interactive effect of rearing and assay conditions: fish reared in clear water tended to decrease activity in turbid water, whereas fish reared in turbid water tended to increase activity in turbid water. Guppies from all treatments decreased activity when exposed to a predator. To measure plasticity in the visual system, we quantified treatment differences in opsin gene expression of individuals. We detected a shift from mid-wave-sensitive opsins to long wave-sensitive opsins for guppies reared in turbid water. Since long-wavelength sensitivity is important in motion detection, this shift likely allows guppies to salvage motion-detecting abilities when visual information is obscured in turbid water.

We induced in rainbow trout through intraperitoneal (IP) treatments, hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic changes to assess the response of parameters involved in lactate metabolism in glucosensing areas like hypothalamus and hindbrain. To distinguish those effects from those induced by peripheral changes in the levels of metabolites or hormones, we also carried out intracerebroventricular (ICV) treatments with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue thus inducing local glucopenia) or glucose. Finally, we also incubated hypothalamus and hindbrain in vitro in the presence of increased glucose concentrations. The changes in glucose availability were in general correlated to changes in the amount of lactate in both areas. However, when we assessed in these areas the response of parameters related to lactate metabolism, the results obtained were contradictory. The increase in glucose levels did not produce in general the expected changes in those pathways with only a minor increase in their capacity of lactate production. The decrease in glucose levels was, however, more clearly related to a decreased capacity of the pathways involved in the production and use of lactate, and this was especially evident after ICV treatment with 2-DG in both areas. In conclusion, the present results while addressing the existence of changes in lactate metabolism after inducing changes in glucose levels in brain glucosensing areas only partially support the possible existence of an astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle in hypothalamus and hindbrain of rainbow trout relating glucose availability to lactate production and use.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The importance of early-life experience on the muscle phenotype later in life is well known. Here, we study the effects of 5 weeks of moderate and sustained swimming activity (5 BL s−1) in gilthead sea bream during early development. We analysed growth and body indexes, plasma IGF-I and GH levels, feed conversion, composition [proximate and isotopic (15N/13C)] and metabolic key enzymes (COX, CS, LDH, HOAD, HK, ALAT, ASAT) of white muscle. Moderate and continuous exercise in fingerlings of gilthead sea bream increased plasma IGF-I, whereas it reduced plasma GH. Under these conditions, growth rate improved without any modification to feed intake through an increase in muscle mass and a reduction in mesenteric fat deposits. There were no changes in the content and turnover of muscle proteins and lipid reserves. Glycogen stores were maintained, but glycogen turnover was higher in white muscle of exercised fish. A lower LDH/CS ratio demonstrated an improvement in the aerobic capacity of white muscle, while a reduction in the COX/CS ratio possibly indicated a functional adaptation of mitochondria to adjust to the tissue-specific energy demand and metabolic fuel availability in exercised fish. We discuss the synergistic effects of dietary nutrients and sustained exercise on the different mitochondrial responses.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The endemic blue-banded bee, Amegilla chlorocyanea, is a solitary species that is an important pollinator in the south-west Australian biodiversity hotspot. Responses were compared with the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, naturalised in Western Australia almost 200 years ago. Metabolic rate increased exponentially with temperature to a peak in both species, and then declined rapidly, with unique scaling exponents and peaks for all species-by-season comparisons. Early in the austral summer, Apis was less thermally tolerant than Amegilla, but the positions reversed later in the foraging season. There were also significant exponential increases in evaporative water loss with increasing temperature, and both season and species contributed to significantly different responses. Apis maintained relatively consistent thermal performance of metabolic rate between seasons, but at the expense of increased rates of evaporative water loss later in summer. In contrast, Amegilla had dramatically increased metabolic requirements later in summer, but maintained consistent thermal performance of evaporative water loss. Although both species acclimated to higher thermal tolerance, the physiological strategies underpinning the acclimation differed.

As organisms grow, their eyes must be able to achieve and maintain emmetropia, a state in which photoreceptors receive sharp images of objects that are at infinity. While there has been ample research into how vertebrates coordinate eyes growth, this has never been addressed in arthropods with camera eyes, which tend to grow dramatically and typically in a step-wise manner with each molt (ecdysis). Here, we used histological and optical methods to measure how the larval eyes of Sunburst Diving Beetles (Thermonectus marmoratus, Coleoptera, Dytiscidae) grow, and how well optical and morphological parameters match, during the dramatic growth that occurs between two consecutive larval stages. We find that the eye tubes of the principal eyes of T.marmoratus grow substantially around molt, with the vitreous-like crystalline cone contributing the most to the overall growth.

Here, we studied the dynamic properties of Papilio photoreceptors using light stimulation with randomly modulated intensity and light pulses. Frequency response (gain) of all photoreceptor classes shared a general profile—a broad peak around 10 Hz with a declining slope towards higher frequency range. At 100 Hz, the mean relative gain of the distal green receptors was significantly larger than any other receptor classes, indicating that they are the fastest. Photoreceptor activities under dim light were higher in the ultraviolet and violet receptors, suggesting higher transduction sensitivities.

They inhabit steppes, semi-deserts, and deserts in continental Asia with a climate changing from a moderate to a hard Continental one with extreme daily and seasonal variations. These different environmental challenges are likely to have consequences for hamsters’ morphology, physiology, and behavior. Hamsters of all three species were investigated during the course of the year in the laboratory though using natural lighting and temperature conditions. Motor activity and body temperature were measured continuously, and body mass, testes size, and fur coloration every 1–2 weeks. With regard to the pattern of activity, nearly twice as many Pc as Ps hamsters (25 vs. 14 %) failed to respond to changes of photoperiod, whereas all Pr hamsters did. Body mass and testes size were high in summer and low in winter, with the biggest relative change in Ps and the lowest in Pr hamsters. Changes of fur coloration were found in Ps hamsters only. All responding animals (that is excluding Pr), exhibited regular torpor bouts during the short winter days. In autumn, seasonal changes started considerably earlier in Ps hamsters. To investigate the putative causes of these different time courses, a further experiment was performed, to identify the critical photoperiod. Hamsters were kept for 10 weeks under different photoperiods, changing from 16 to 8 h light per day. Motor activity was recorded continuously, to identify responding and non-responding animals. Body mass was measured at the beginning and the end of the experiment, testes mass only at the end. The critical photoperiod was found to be similar in all three species. Though in a further experiment, Pc and Pr hamsters showed a delayed response, whereas the changes in Ps hamsters started immediately following transfer to short-day conditions. The results show that interspecific differences in seasonal adaptation exist, even between the closely related Ps and Pc hamsters, possibly due to different conditions in their natural habitat.

We explored this with auditory stimuli including the bird’s own song (BOS) and BOS variants with increased relative power at low frequencies (LBOS). We recorded single units from BOS-selective neurons in two forebrain nuclei (HVC and Area X) in anesthetized zebra finches. Song-evoked responses were analyzed based on both rate (spike counts) and temporal coding of spike trains. The BOS and LBOS tended to evoke similar spike-count responses in substantially overlapping populations of neurons in both HVC and Area X. Analysis of spike patterns demonstrated temporal coding information that discriminated among the BOS and LBOS stimuli significantly better than spike counts in the majority of HVC (94 %) and Area X (85 %) neurons. HVC neurons contained more and a broader range of temporal coding information to discriminate among the stimuli than Area X neurons.

Free-living dormice (Glis glis) can hibernate for 11 months in non-reproductive years,"Edible dormice are arboreal rodents adapted to yearly fluctuations in seed production of European beech, a major food source for this species. In years of low beech seed abundance, dormice skip reproduction and non-reproductive dormice fed ad libitum in captivity can display summer dormancy in addition to winter hibernation. To test whether summer dormancy, that is, a very early onset of hibernation, actually occurs in free-living dormice, we monitored core body temperature (Tb) over ~12 months in 17 animals during a year of beech seeding failure in the Vienna Woods. We found that 8 out of 17 dormice indeed re-entered hibernation as early as in June/July, with five of them having extreme hibernation durations of 11 months or more (total range: 7.8–11.4 months). Thus, we show for the first time that a free-living mammal relying on natural food resources can continuously hibernate for >11 months. Early onset of hibernation was associated with high body mass in the spring, but the distribution of hibernation onset was bimodal with prolonged hibernation starting either early (prior to July 28) or late (after August 30).

For rhythmic signals that carry information in specific frequency bands, a neuronal system may profit from tuning its inherent filtering properties towards a peak sensitivity in the respective frequency range. The cricket Gryllus bimaculatus evaluates acoustic communication signals of both conspecifics and predators. The song signals of conspecifics exhibit a characteristic pulse pattern that contains only a narrow range of modulation frequencies. We examined individual neurons (AN1, AN2, ON1) in the peripheral auditory system of the cricket for tuning towards specific modulation frequencies by assessing their firing-rate resonance. Acoustic stimuli with a swept-frequency envelope allowed an efficient characterization of the cells’ modulation transfer functions. Some of the examined cells exhibited tuned band-pass properties. Using simple computational models, we demonstrate how different, cell-intrinsic or network-based mechanisms such as subthreshold resonances, spike-triggered adaptation, as well as an interplay of excitation and inhibition can account for the experimentally observed firing-rate resonances. Therefore, basic neuronal mechanisms that share negative feedback as a common theme may contribute to selectivity in the peripheral auditory pathway of crickets that is designed towards mate recognition and predator avoidance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To show how they balance energetics and thermoregulation under variable environmental conditions, we measured the body temperature and respiration of sucrose foragers (1.5 M, unlimited flow) under variable ambient temperature (Ta = 20–35 °C) and solar radiation (20–570 W m−2). Results revealed a graduated balancing of metabolic efforts with thermoregulatory needs. The thoracic temperature in the shade depended on ambient temperature, increasing from ~37 to 39 °C. However, wasps used solar heat gain to regulate their thorax temperature at a rather high level at low Ta (mean Tthorax ~ 39 °C). Only at high Ta they used solar heat to reduce their metabolic rate remarkably. A high body temperature accelerated the suction speed and shortened foraging time. As the costs of foraging strongly depended on duration, the efficiency could be significantly increased with a high body temperature. Heat gain from solar radiation enabled the wasps to enhance foraging efficiency at high ambient temperature (Ta = 30 °C) by up to 63 %. The well-balanced change of economic strategies in response to environmental conditions minimized costs of foraging and optimized energetic efficiency.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In a first series of experiments, the rate of oxygen consumption ($$\dot{V}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }}$$V˙O2), breathing frequency (fR), heart rate (fH), and EEG and EMG (neck muscle) activity were measured in different sleep/wake states (sleeping, awake but quiet, alert, or moving). In general, metabolic and cardio-respiratory changes were better indictors of the transition from sleep to wake than were changes in the EEG and EMG. In a second series of experiments, the interactive effects of temperature (17, 27 and 37 °C) and activity states on fR, tidal volume (VT), the fraction of oxygen extracted from the lung per breath (FIO2–FEO2), fH, and the cardiac O2 pulse were quantified to determine the relative roles of each of these variables in accommodating changes in $$\dot{V}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }}$$V˙O2. The increases in oxygen supply to meet temperature- and activity-induced increases in oxygen demand were produced almost exclusively by increases in fH and fR. Regression analysis showed that the effects of temperature and activity state on the relationships between fH, fR and $$\dot{V}_{{{\text{O}}_{ 2} }}$$V˙O2 was to extend a common relationship along a single curve, rather than separate relationships for each metabolic state.

Using an isolated nerve cord preparation, we found that the spike activities of both the abdominal postural and uropod motor neurones in response to sensory stimulation of the exopodite reversed in dominant animals. In naive and subordinate animals, extensor motor neurones were excited and antagonistic flexor motor neurones inhibited in response to sensory stimulation. Furthermore, the spike frequency of uropod closer motor neurones increased while that of the antagonistic opener motor neurones decreased. By contrast, in more than half of the dominant animals, flexor and opener motor neurones showed excitatory responses while extensor and closer motor neurones showed inhibitory responses to the same sensory stimulation.

To this end, heart rate (fH), respiration rate (fR), and deep body temperature (Tb) were continuously monitored in outdoor enclosures by radio-telemetry for nine months. There was a continuous decline in nighttime breathing and heart rate, at constant Tb, throughout the late summer and fall suggestive of an active metabolic suppression that developed progressively at night preceding the entrance into dormancy. During the day, however, the tegus still emerged to bask. In May, when the tegus made a behavioural commitment to dormancy, Tb (day and night) fell to match burrow temperature, accompanied by a further reduction in fH and fR. Tegus, under the conditions of this study, did arouse periodically during dormancy. There was a complex interplay between changes in fH and Tb associated with the direct effects of temperature and the indirect effects of thermoregulation, activity, and changes in metabolism. This interplay gave rise to a daily hysteresis in the fH/Tb relationship reflective of the physiological changes associated with warming and cooling as preferred Tb alternated between daytime and nighttime levels.

Many animals adjust their behavior to environmental conditions based on a social context. Despite having relatively simple visual systems, Drosophila larvae are capable of identifying and are attracted to the movements of other larvae. Here, we show that Drosophila larval visual recognition is encoded by the movements of nearby larvae, experienced during a specific developmental critical period. Exposure to moving larvae, only during a specific period, is sufficient for later visual recognition of movement. Larvae exposed to wild-type body movements, during the critical period, are not attracted to the movements of tubby mutants, which have altered morphology. However, exposure to tubby, during the critical period, results in tubby recognition at the expense of wild-type recognition indicating that this is true learning. Visual recognition is not learned in excessively crowded conditions, and this is emulated by exposure, during the critical period, to food previously used by crowded larvae. We propose that Drosophila larvae have a distinct critical period, during which they assess both social and resource conditions, and that this irreversibly determines later visually guided social behavior. This model provides a platform towards understanding the regulation and development of social behavior.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, whether environmental noise has effect on the high-frequency hearing of frogs is largely unclear. By measuring the auditory evoked near-field potentials (AENFPs) from the torus semicircularis of the midbrain at frequencies 1–23 kHz in the presence of three noise levels, we found no significant difference in the peak-to-peak amplitude, threshold and latency of AENFP between low-level (35 dB SPL) background noise and mid-level (65 dB SPL) broadcast natural noise. For a natural noise level of 85 dB SPL, AENFP amplitude decreased and threshold and latency increased at frequencies 3–13 kHz.

To this end we examined ventricular AP and the role of two major potassium currents (IK1, IKr) in repolarization of cardiac AP in winter-acclimatized (WA, caught in March) and summer-acclimatized (SA, caught in September) navaga cod (Eleginus navaga) of the White Sea. The duration of ventricular AP of WA navaga at 3 °C (APD50 = 659.5 ± 32.8 ms) was similar to the AP duration of SA navaga at 12 °C (APD50 = 543.9 ± 14.6 ms) (p > 0.05) indicating complete thermal compensation of AP duration. This acclimation effect was associated with strong up-regulation of the cardiac potassium currents in winter. Densities of ventricular IK1 (at −120 mV) and IKr (at +50 mV) of the WA navaga at 3 °C were 2.9 times and 2.8 times, respectively, higher than those of the SA navaga at 12 °C, thus indicating marked thermal overcompensation. Qualitatively similar results were obtained from atrial myocytes. Seasonal changes in IK1 and IKr are more than sufficient to explain the complete thermal compensation of ventricular AP duration. The excellent acclimation capacity of cardiac excitability of the navaga cod is probably needed to maintain high cardiac performance at subzero temperatures in winter and to increase thermal resilience of cardiac function under seasonally variable arctic temperature conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, insulin’s role in brain functions, such as cognition, attention, and memory, remains unknown. Studies using invertebrates with their open blood-vascular system have the promise of promoting a better understanding of the role played by insulin in mediating/modulating cognitive functions. In this review, the relationship between insulin and its impact on long-term memory (LTM) is discussed particularly in snails. The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis has the ability to undergo conditioned taste aversion (CTA), that is, it associatively learns and forms LTM not to respond with a feeding response to a food that normally elicits a robust feeding response. We show that molluscan insulin-related peptides are up-regulated in snails exhibiting CTA–LTM and play a key role in the causal neural basis of CTA–LTM.

Here we investigated standard metabolic rates (SMR) and plasma parameters of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) after 3–4 weeks of exposure to ambient and future PCO2 levels (550, 1200 and 2200 µatm) and at two temperatures (10, 18 °C). In vivo branchial ion regulatory costs were studied in isolated, perfused gill preparations. Animals reared at 18 °C responded to increasing CO2 by elevating SMR, in contrast to specimens at 10 °C. Isolated gills at 10 °C and elevated PCO2 (≥1200 µatm) displayed increased soft tissue mass, in parallel to increased gill oxygen demand, indicating an increased fraction of gill in whole animal energy budget. Altered gill size was not found at 18 °C, where a shift in the use of ion regulation mechanisms occurred towards enhanced Na+/H+-exchange and HCO3− transport at high PCO2 (2200 µatm), paralleled by higher Na+/K+-ATPase activities. This shift did not affect total gill energy consumption leaving whole animal energy budget unaffected. Higher Na+/K+-ATPase activities in the warmth might have compensated for enhanced branchial permeability and led to reduced plasma Na+ and/or Cl− concentrations and slightly lowered osmolalities seen at 18 °C and 550 or 2200 µatm PCO2 in vivo.

However, through phenotypic diversity, they demonstrate remarkable resilience to deteriorating conditions. In fish populations, inter-individual variation in a number of fitness-determining physiological traits, including cardiac performance, is classically observed. Information about the cellular bases of inter-individual variability in cardiac performance is scarce including the possible contribution of excitation–contraction (EC) coupling. This study aimed at providing insight into EC coupling-related Ca2+ response and thermal plasticity in the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). A cell population approach was used to lay the methodological basis for identifying the cellular determinants of cardiac performance. Fish were acclimated at 12 and 22 °C and changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) following KCl stimulation were measured using Fura-2, at 12 or 22 °C-test. The increase in [Ca2+]i resulted primarily from extracellular Ca2+ entry but sarcoplasmic reticulum stores were also shown to be involved. As previously reported in sea bass, a modest effect of adrenaline was observed. Moreover, although the response appeared relatively insensitive to an acute temperature change, a difference in Ca2+ response was observed between 12- and 22 °C-acclimated fish. In particular, a greater increase in [Ca2+]i at a high level of adrenaline was observed in 22 °C-acclimated fish that may be related to an improved efficiency of adrenaline under these conditions. In conclusion, this method allows a rapid screening of cellular characteristics.

We measured enzyme activities, mRNA expression and protein levels in pectoralis and heart for several key steps of lipid transport and catabolism pathways to investigate whether these pathways were upregulated during migration. We used yellow-rumped (Setophaga coronata) and yellow (S. petechia) warblers and warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus) as study species because they all show migration-induced increases in organismal metabolic capacities. For yellow-rumped warblers, β-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase (HOAD) activities and fatty acid transporter mRNA and/or protein levels were higher during spring than fall in pectoralis and heart, except that fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) protein levels showed the opposite pattern in heart. Lipid transporter protein levels, but not mRNA expression, in pectoralis and heart of warbling vireos were higher either during spring or fall than summer, but this was not true for HOAD activities. For yellow warblers, pectoralis, but not heart, protein levels of lipid transporters were upregulated during migration relative to summer, but this pattern was not evident for mRNA expression or HOAD activity. Finally, muscle and heart citrate synthase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activities showed little seasonal variation for any species. These data suggest that pectoralis and heart lipid transport and catabolism capacities are often, but not universally, important correlates of elevated organismal metabolic capacity during migration.

Honey bees were displaced several 100 m from their hive to an unfamiliar site and provisioned with honey. After feeding, almost two-thirds of the bees flew home to their hive within a 50 min observation time. About half of these returning, bees signalled the direction of the release site in waggle dances thus demonstrating that the dance can be guided entirely by information gathered on a single homeward trip. The likely reason for the bees’ enthusiastic dancing on their initial return from this new site was the highly rewarding honeycomb that they were given there. The attractive nature of the site is confirmed by many of these bees revisiting the site and continuing to forage there.

AMPK is activated during energy stress by a rise in AMP:ATP ratio and maintains energy balance by phosphorylating targets to switch on catabolic ATP-generating pathways, while at the same time switching off anabolic ATP-consuming processes. Metabolic depression is a strategy used by many animals to survive environmental stress and has been extensively studied across phylogeny by comparative biochemists and physiologists, but the role of AMPK has only recently been addressed. This review first deals with the evolution of AMPK in eukaryotes (excluding plants and fungi) and its regulation. Changes in adenine nucleotides and AMPK activation are described in animals during environmental energy stress, before considering the involvement of AMPK in controlling β-oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, triacylglycerol mobilization and protein synthesis.

After these periods, animals are at their leanest and resume actively foraging for the austral winter. In mammals, decreased exercise and hypoxia exposure typically lead to decreased production of O2-carrying proteins and muscle wasting, while endurance training increases aerobic potential. To test whether similar effects were present in marine mammals, this study compared the physiology of 53 post-molt female Weddell seals in the austral fall to 47 pre-breeding females during the spring in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Once body mass and condition (lipid) were controlled for, there were no seasonal changes in total body oxygen (TBO2) stores. Within each season, hematocrit and hemoglobin values were negatively correlated with animal size, and larger animals had lower mass-specific TBO2 stores. But because larger seals had lower mass-specific metabolic rates, their calculated aerobic dive limit was similar to smaller seals. Indicators of muscular efficiency, myosin heavy chain composition, myoglobin concentrations, and aerobic enzyme activities (citrate synthase and β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) were likewise maintained across the year. The preservation of aerobic capacity is likely critical to foraging capabilities, so that following the molt Weddell seals can rapidly regain body mass at the start of winter foraging. In contrast, muscle lactate dehydrogenase activity, a marker of anaerobic metabolism, exhibited seasonal plasticity in this diving top predator and was lowest after the summer period of reduced activity.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Studies of central pattern generators have influenced profoundly the way we think about neurons, neuronal networks and their functional properties. It is clear, for example, that neuronal circuits can be reconfigured through the action of neuromodulatory neurons to produce a variety of outputs, and that intrinsic membrane properties of neurons are subject to homeostatic regulation. In this special issue, Marder and colleagues describe the effects of temperature on motor patterns generated by the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab, Cancer borealis, and consider how neuronal networks and the output they generate remain stable in the face of extreme temperature fluctuations. Temperature is a central focus also of the contribution from Xu and colleagues who consider the sophisticated mechanisms that have evolved to enable animals to sense and adapt to changes in temperature. In their review, these authors present a strongly comparative viewpoint, and their discussion offers fascinating insights into the effects of temperature on aging and longevity. Homeostasis, as an overarching theme, is central also to the contribution by Keene and colleagues, who discuss how the brain of the fruit fly modulates sleep and how sleep in this insect, and in other animals, is influenced by metabolic state.

They explore what is, and what is not, known about This special issue celebrates excellent examples of invertebrate neuroscience. It has its origins in the Cold Spring Harbor Asia (CSHA) Conferences on invertebrate neurobiology held recently in Suzhou, China, and is designed to provide a ‘taster’ of some of the exciting works presented at these meetings. There are of course very many aspects of invertebrate neurobiology that have seen remarkable advances in recent years. This issue highlights a small number of interesting examples. The topics are as diverse as they are interesting, and illustrate well the excitement that exists in current invertebrate neuroscience. For many years, there has been intense interest in the neuronal circuits (central pattern generators, CPGs) that produce rhythmic motor patterns supporting activities such as feeding, walking, swimming, and breathing. Sakurai and Katz discuss the unique perspective that the study of gastropod CPGs brings to this field. One important emerging concept is that different and independently evolved circuits using the same set of neurons can generate the same behavior. Their contribution to this special issue illustrates beautifully the power of a comparative approach.

Only one species of diving bird, the black-footed penguin (Spheniscusdemersus), has been studied in respect to auditory capabilities (Wever et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63:676–680, 1969). We, therefore, measured in-air auditory threshold in ten species of diving birds, using the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The average audiogram obtained for each species followed the U-shape typical of birds and many other animals. All species tested shared a common region of the greatest sensitivity, from 1000 to 3000 Hz, although audiograms differed significantly across species. Thresholds of all duck species tested were more similar to each other than to the two non-duck species tested. The red-throated loon (Gavia stellata) and northern gannet (Morus bassanus) exhibited the highest thresholds while the lowest thresholds belonged to the duck species, specifically the lesser scaup (Aythyaaffinis) and ruddy duck (Oxyurajamaicensis). Vocalization parameters were also measured for each species, and showed that with the exception of the common eider (Somateriamollisima), the peak frequency, i.e., frequency at the greatest intensity, of all species’ vocalizations measured here fell between 1000 and 3000 Hz, matching the bandwidth of the most sensitive hearing range.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

They appear to use many of the physical cue sources available in the natural environment for Map-and-Compass navigation. Two compass mechanisms that have been well documented in pigeons are a time-compensated sun compass and a magnetic inclination compass. Location-finding, or map, mechanisms have been more elusive. Visual landmarks, magnetic fields, odors, gravity and now also infrasound have been proposed as sources of information on location. Even in highly familiar locations, pigeons appear to neither use nor need landmarks and can even return to the loft while wearing frosted lenses. Direct and indirect evidence indicates magnetic field information influences pigeon navigation in ways that are consistent with magnetic map components. The role of odors is unclear; it might be motivational in nature rather than navigational. The influence of gravity must be further analyzed. Experiments with infrasound have been interpreted in the sense that they provide information on the home direction, but this hypothesis is inconsistent with the Map-and-Compass Model. All these factors appear to be components of a multifactorial system, with the pigeons being opportunistic, preferring those cues that prove most suitable in their home region. This has made understanding the roles of individual cues challenging.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Polistes dominulus exhibits an energy-extensive mode of life, spending much time resting at the nest, which should be reflected in adaptations regarding gas exchange and standard metabolism. We analysed the resting metabolism (CO2 emission) of Polistes dominulus workers in the ambient temperature range an individual may be exposed to during a breeding season (Ta = 2.4–40.6 °C) via flow through respirometry. Behaviour and endothermic activity were assessed by infrared thermography. With rising Ta, CO2 release followed an exponential increase from 27 to 149 and 802 nl g−1 min−1 at Ta = 3, 20 and 35 °C, respectively. Measurements of the thermal regime at the nest showed that resting P. dominulus are most of the time in the lower range of their standard metabolic curve. A comparison with a “highly energetic” wasp like Vespula sp. revealed that Polistes dominulus not only optimises behaviour but also reduces metabolism to save energy. The CO2 emission patterns changed with ambient temperature, from discontinuous (≤25 °C) to cyclic (25–36 °C) and continuous gas exchange at higher temperatures. A pronounced break appeared in the data progression regarding cycle frequency and CO2 emission per gas exchange cycle between 15 and 10 °C. This striking change in gas exchange features indicates a physiological adaptation to special respiratory requirements at low temperatures.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Keeton and his co-workers at Cornell University. The previously unpublished data indicate that departure directions of the operated birds were significantly different from those of sham-operated control birds (314 total), indicating that aural cues play an important part in the pigeon’s navigational system. Moreover, propagation modeling of infrasonic waves using meteorological data for the release days supports the possibility that control birds used infrasonic signals to determine their homeward direction. Local acoustic ‘shadow’ zones, therefore, could have caused initial disorientation of control birds at release sites where they were normally well oriented. Experimental birds plausibly employed an alternate ‘route-reversal’ strategy to return home perhaps using their ocular-based magnetic compass. We suggest, based on Keeton’s results from another site of long-term disorientation, that experienced pigeons depend predominantly on infrasonic cues for initial orientation, and that surgical removal of their aural sense compelled them to switch to a secondary navigational strategy.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The modern consumption of over 70 % of foods and beverages in highly refined form favours the diet-related classification of humans as cucinivores, rather than omnivores. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans have consumed cooked food for at least 300–400,000 years, and divergence in genes associated with human subpopulations that utilise different foods has been shown to occur over periods of 10–30,000 years. One such divergence is the greater presence of adult lactase persistence in communities that have consumed dairy products, over periods of about 8,000 years, compared to communities not consuming dairy products. We postulate that 300–400,000 years, or 10,000–14,000 generations, is sufficient time for food processing to have influenced the form and function of the human digestive tract. It is difficult to determine how long humans have prepared foods in other ways, such as pounding, grinding, drying or fermenting, but this appears to be for at least 20,000 years, which has been sufficient time to influence gene expression for digestive enzymes. Cooking and food processing expands the range of food that can be eaten, extends food availability into lean times and enhances digestibility. Cooking also detoxifies food to some extent, destroys infective agents, decreases eating time and slightly increases the efficiency of assimilation of energy substrates. On the other hand, cooking can destroy some nutrients and produce toxic products. The human digestive system is suited to a processed food diet because of its smaller volume, notably smaller colonic volume, relative to the intestines of other species, and because of differences from other primates in dentition and facial muscles that result in lower bite strength. There is no known group of humans which does not consume cooked foods, and the modern diet is dominated by processed foods. We conclude that humans are well adapted as consumers of processed, including cooked, foods.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We compared, using wire myography, the reactivity of allantoic and YS arteries from 19-day chicken embryos (total incubation 21 days). The contractions induced by KCl, the adrenergic agonists norepinephrine (NE, nonselective), phenylephrine (α1), and oxymetazoline (α2), electric field stimulation (EFS), serotonin, U46619 (TP receptor agonist), and endothelin (ET)-1 and the relaxations induced by acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), forskolin (adenylate cyclase activator), and isoproterenol (β-adrenergic agonist) were investigated. Extraembryonic allantoic arteries did not show α-adrenergic-mediated contraction (either elicited by exogenous agonists or EFS) or ACh-induced (endothelium-dependent) relaxation, whereas these responses were present in YS arteries. Interestingly, the intraembryonic segment of the allantoic artery showed EFS- and α-adrenergic-induced contraction and ACh-mediated relaxation. Moreover, glyoxylic acid staining showed the presence of catecholamine-containing nerves in the YS and the intraembryonic allantoic artery, but not in the extraembryonic allantoic artery. Isoproterenol- and forskolin-induced relaxation and ET-1-induced contraction were higher in YS than in allantoic arteries, whereas serotonin- and U46619-induced contraction and SNP-induced relaxation did not significantly differ between the two arteries. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a different pattern of reactivity in the arteries perfusing the gas exchange and the nutritional membranes of the chicken embryo.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However oscars, which live in the frequently hypoxic ion-poor waters of the Amazon, actually decrease ionic fluxes across the gills during acute hypoxia without changing gill paracellular permeability, and exhibit rapid paving over of the mitochondrial-rich cells (MRCs). But what happens during prolonged exercise? Gill paracellular permeability, ionic fluxes, and gill morphology were examined in juvenile oscars at rest and during aerobic swimming. Initial validation tests with urinary catheterized fish quantified drinking, glomerular filtration, and urinary flow rates, and confirmed that measurements of gill paracellular permeability as [3H]PEG-4000 clearances were the same in efflux and influx directions, but far lower than previously measured in comparably sized trout. Although the oscars achieved a very similar proportional increase (90 %) in oxygen consumption (MO2) to trout during steady-state swimming at 1.2 body lengths sec−1, there was no increase in gill paracellular permeability, in contrast to trout. However, oscars did exhibit increased unidirectional Na+ efflux and net K+ rates during exercise, but no change in drinking rate. There were no changes in MRC numbers or exposure, or other alterations in gill morphology during exercise. A substantial interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) that covered the lamellae to a depth of 30 % was unchanged by 4 h of swimming activity. We conclude that a low branchial paracellular permeability which can be dissociated from changes in O2 flux, as well as the presence of the ILCM, may be adaptive in limiting ionoregulatory costs for a species endemic to ion-poor, frequently hypoxic waters.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

While all species within Pythonidae brood their eggs, only two species are known to produce heat to enhance embryonic thermal regulation. By contrast, a few python species have been reported to have insignificant thermogenic capabilities. To provide insight into potential phylogenetic, morphological, and ecological factors influencing thermogenic capability among pythons, we measured metabolic rates and clutch-environment temperature differentials at two environmental temperatures—python preferred brooding temperature (31.5 °C) and a sub-optimal temperature (25.5 °C)—in six species of pythons, including members of two major phylogenetic branches currently devoid of data on the subject. We found no evidence of facultative thermogenesis in five species: Aspidites melanocephalus, A. ramsayi, Morelia viridis, M. spilota cheynei, and Python regius. However, we found that Bothrochilus boa had a thermal metabolic sensitivity indicative of facultative thermogenesis (i.e., a higher metabolic rate at the lower temperature). However, its metabolic rate was quite low and technical challenges prevented us from measuring temperature differential to make conclusions about facultative endothermy in this species. Regardless, our data combined with existing literature demonstrate that facultative thermogenesis is not as widespread among pythons as previously thought.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The pioneering work of JZ Young described the morphological convergence of the VL with the mammalian hippocampus, cerebellum and the insect mushroom body. Studies in octopus and cuttlefish VL networks suggest evolutionary convergence into a universal organization of connectivity as a divergence-convergence (‘fan-out fan-in’) network with activity-dependent long-term plasticity mechanisms. Yet, these studies also show that the properties of the neurons, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and maintenance are highly variable among different species. This suggests that complex networks may have evolved independently multiple times and that even though memory and learning networks share similar organization and cellular processes, there are many molecular ways of constructing them.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The presence of cVA in a male suppresses courtship motivation of other males and averts male–male courtship. Meanwhile, aggression behaviors between males are promoted by a high amount of cVA caused by increased densities of male flies. cVA also works as a modifier of courtship memory, which is suppressed courtship motivation driven by previous unsuccessful courtship experience. Conversely, cVA in the courting male stimulates female reproductive motivation and increases the probability of copulation success. It also works as an aggregation pheromone, attracting both males and females at the gathering spot. Thus, cVA is a unique example of a single molecule leading to different behaviors in response to the social context. However, despite recent advances in understanding the molecular and neural machinery for cVA sensing, it is still largely unknown how cVA triggers a specific behavior as the situation demands.

To thrive under the ever fluctuating environmental temperatures, animals have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and adapt to temperature changes. Animals sense temperature through various molecular thermosensors, such as thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels expressed in neurons, keratinocytes, and intestine. These evolutionarily conserved thermosensitive TRP channels feature distinct activation thresholds, thereby covering a wide spectrum of ambient temperature. Temperature changes trigger complex thermosensory behaviors. Due to the simplicity of the nervous system in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, the mechanisms of thermosensory behaviors in these species have been extensively studied at the circuit and molecular levels. While much is known about temperature regulation of behavior, it remains largely unclear how temperature affects aging. Recent studies in C. elegans demonstrate that temperature modulation of longevity is not simply a passive thermodynamic phenomenon as suggested by the rate-of-living theory, but rather a process that is actively regulated by genes, including those encoding thermosensitive TRP channels.

In vertebrate visual systems, the establishment of topographic maps involves the formation of a coarse topography followed by that of fine-scale topography that distinguishes the axon terminals of neighboring neurons. It is known that intrinsic differences in the form of broad gradients of guidance molecules instruct coarse topography while neuronal activity is required for fine-scale topography. On the other hand, studies in the Drosophila visual system have shown that intrinsic differences in cell adhesion among the axon terminals of neighboring neurons instruct the fine-scale topography. Recent studies on activity-dependent topography in the Drosophila somatosensory system have revealed a role of neuronal activity in creating molecular differences among sensory neurons for establishing fine-scale topography, implicating a conserved principle.

To understand how these fishes cope with hyposmotic stress on a cellular level, we used the spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) as a model to test whether a reciprocal relationship exists between the cell’s two primary protein protection mechanisms, the chemical (e.g., trimethylamine oxide, TMAO) and molecular (e.g., heat shock protein 70, HSP70) chaperone systems. This relationship is interesting given that many elasmobranchs are expected to gain water and lose osmolytes, chemical chaperones, and ions as they osmoconform to new, lowered salinity. Dogfish were cannulated for repeated blood sampling and exposed to 70 % seawater (SW) for 48 h. These hyposmotic conditions had no effect on red blood cell (RBC) and white muscle TMAO concentrations, and did not result in HSP70 induction or signs of protein damage (i.e., increased ubiquitin), suggesting that TMAO levels were sufficiently protective in these tissues. However, in the gill, we observed a significant decrease in TMAO concentration and a significant induction of HSP70 as well as signs of protein damage. In the face of this cellular stress response, gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity significantly increased during hyposmotic conditions, as expected. We suggest that this functional preservation in the gill is partly the result of HSP70 induction with lowered salinity. We conclude a reciprocal relationship between TMAO and HSP70 in the gills of dogfish as a result of in vivo hyposmotic stress. When osmotically induced protein damage surpasses the protective capacity of remaining TMAO, HSP70 is induced to preserve tissue and organismal function.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Inhibitory interactions from nonspiking interneurones to the uropod motor neurones were one-way and chemically mediated. The depolarization of the motor neurones with current injection increased the amplitude of the nonspiking interneurone-mediated hyperpolarization, while hyperpolarization of the motor neurone decreased it. By contrast, excitatory interactions from the nonspiking interneurones to the motor neurones were not mediated via chemical synaptic transmissions. These excitatory connections with the slow motor neurones were one-way while connections with fast motor neurones were bidirectional. Nonspiking interneurone-mediated membrane depolarization of the motor neurones was not affected by the passage of hyperpolarizing current. Each motor neurone spike elicited a time-locked EPSP in the nonspiking interneurones with very short delay (0.2 ms) that suggested electrical coupling between nonspiking interneurones and motor neurones. Nonspiking interneurones directly control the organization of slow motor neurone activity, while they appear to regulate the background activity of the fast motor neurones.

Using CF and CF–FM echolocation signals as acoustic stimuli, the responses of inferior collicular (IC) neurons of Hipposideros armiger were obtained by extracellular recordings. We tested the effect of preceding CF or CF–FM sounds on the shape of the frequency tuning curves (FTCs) of IC neurons. Results showed that both CF–FM and CF sounds reduced the number of FTCs with tailed lower-frequency-side of IC neurons. However, more IC neurons experienced such conversion after adding CF–FM sound compared with CF sound. We also found that the Q20 value of the FTC of IC neurons experienced the largest increase with the addition of CF–FM sound. Moreover, only CF–FM sound could cause an increase in the slope of the neurons’ FTCs, and such increase occurred mainly in the lower-frequency edge.

Bull 99:259–271, 1950) employed Newton’s law of cooling to describe how metabolic rates (MR) in birds and mammals vary predictably with ambient temperature (Ta). Here, we explore the theoretical consequences of Newton’s law of cooling and show that a thermoregulatory polygon provides an intuitively simple and yet useful description of thermoregulatory responses in endothermic organisms. This polygon encapsulates the region in which heat production and dissipation are in equilibrium and, therefore, the range of conditions in which thermoregulation is possible. Whereas the typical U-shaped curve describes the relationship between Ta and MR at rest, thermoregulatory polygons expand this framework to incorporate the impact of activity, other behaviors and environmental conditions on thermoregulation and energy balance. We discuss how this framework can be employed to study the limits to effective thermoregulation and their ecological repercussions, allometric effects and residual variation in MR and thermal insulation, and how thermoregulatory requirements might constrain locomotor or reproductive performance (as proposed, for instance, by the heat dissipation limit theory). In many systems the limited empirical knowledge on how organismal traits may respond to environmental changes prevents physiological ecology from becoming a fully developed predictive science. In endotherms, however, we contend that the lack of theoretical developments that translate current physiological understanding into formal mechanistic models remains the main impediment to study the ecological and evolutionary repercussions of thermoregulation. In spite of the inherent limitations of Newton’s law of cooling as an oversimplified description of the mechanics of heat transfer, we argue that understanding how systems that obey this approximation work can be enlightening on conceptual grounds and relevant as an analytical and predictive tool to study ecological phenomena. As such, the proposed approach may constitute a powerful tool to study the impact of thermoregulatory constraints on variables related to fitness, such as survival and reproductive output, and help elucidating how species will be affected by ongoing climate change.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Metabolic rates were measured using flow through respirometry under video tracking: the CO2 release of male and female spiders was measured. Resting rates were 1.7 (males) and 1.5 nmol s−1 g−1 (females). Gluing of one spiracle did not influence the resting metabolic rate. Factorial scopes during stimulation to maximum metabolic rates were about 12 in intact animals, while elimination of one spiracle reduced the factorial scope to 5.2. Comparison with other araneomorph spiders strengthens the hypothesis that tracheae in spiders increase the metabolic rates of the tracheated species and do not only replace reduced lung capacity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The trained sea lions executed three dive types—single dives, bouts of multiple long dives with 4–6 dives per bout, or bouts of multiple short dives with 10–12 dives per bout—to depths of 40 m, resulting in a range of activity and oxygen consumption levels. Average metabolic rate (AMR) over the dive cycle or dive bout calculated was calculated from $$s\dot{V}_{{{\text{O}}_{2} }}$$sV˙O2. We found that ODBA could statistically predict AMR when data from all dive types were combined, but that dive type was a significant model factor. However, there were no significant linear relationships between AMR and ODBA when data for each dive type were analyzed separately. The potential relationships between AMR and ODBA were not improved by including dive duration, food consumed, proportion of dive cycle spent submerged, or number of dives per bout. It is not clear whether the lack of predictive power within dive type was due to low statistical power, or whether it reflected a true absence of a relationship between ODBA and AMR. The average percent error for predicting AMR from ODBA was 7–11 %, and standard error of the estimated AMR was 5–32 %. Overall, the extensive range of dive behaviors and physiological conditions we tested indicated that ODBA was not suitable for estimating AMR in the field due to considerable error and the inconclusive effects of dive type.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To explore how whole-organism growth rate and the metabolic rate of cultured muscle cells are connected, two lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), one that had been artificially selected for fast growth for over 60 generations and a control line were used to culture myoblasts. In line with previous work, myoblasts from the fast growth line had significantly higher rates of oxygen consumption, glycolytic flux, and higher mitochondrial volume than myoblasts from the control line, indicating that an increase in growth rate is associated with a concomitant increase in cellular metabolic rates and that mitochondrial density contributes to the differences in rates of metabolism between the lines. We reared chicks from two hybrid lines with reciprocal parental configurations for growth rate to explore the effect of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA on rates of growth and metabolism. Growth rates of chicks, cellular basal oxygen consumption, glycolytic flux, and mitochondrial volume in myoblasts from chicks from both reciprocal crosses were intermediate to the fast and control lines. This indicates that genes in the nucleus have a strong influence on metabolic rates at the cellular level, compared with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The relatively stenothermal Cancer pagurus (Cp) and eurythermal Carcinus maenas (Cm) muscle resting potential (RP) hyperpolarised significantly with increasing experimental temperature. The muscle RP in Cm was seasonally dependent at acute temperatures above 20 °C whereas in Cp no seasonal effect was observed. The latent period of the muscle excitatory junction potential (EJP) following tonic motor nerve stimulation was significantly longer in winter-caught crabs in both species, although the effect was significantly more marked in Cp than Cm. Summer-caught Cp had larger excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) than did winter-caught crabs, a seasonal effect not seen in Cm. In contrast, marked seasonal differences were found in the EJP decay time constant in Cm having significantly longer time constants in winter-caught crabs, where no seasonal difference was found in Cp. These results suggest that different seasonal effects of neuromuscular parameters between Cm and Cp may reflect different strategies of response to their different seasonal temperature environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we examine the role that vision and the lateral line play in the rheotactic behavior of a stream-dwelling species (Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus) under both rectilinear and turbulent flow conditions. Turbulence lowered the flow speed at which threshold levels of rheotactic performance were elicited, an effect that was independent of sensory condition. Compared to fish with access to visual information, fish without access exhibited cross-stream casting behaviors and a decrease in the accuracy with which they oriented upstream. Visual deprivation effects were independent of availability of lateral line information and whether flow was rectilinear or turbulent. Fish deprived of lateral line information exhibited no measureable deficits under any of the conditions of this study. This study indicates that rheotactic abilities persist in the absence of both vision and lateral line under both turbulent and non-turbulent conditions, but that turbulence enhances either the motivation or ability of fish to orient to slow currents.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Like all air-breathing fishes studied to date, the African catfish exhibits pronounced changes in heart rate (fH) that are associated with air-breathing events. We acquired fH, gill-breathing frequency (fG) and air-breathing frequency (fAB) in situations that require or do not require air breathing (during normoxia and hypoxia), and we assessed the autonomic control of post-air-breathing tachycardia using an infusion of the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine.

But coding of underwater particle motion in the vestibular medulla remains stable over all of larval development, with no evidence of a “deaf period.” Neural coding of particle motion in the auditory midbrain was assessed to determine if a “deaf period” for this mode of stimulation exists in this brain area in spite of its absence from the vestibular medulla. Recording sites throughout the developing laminar and medial principal nuclei show relatively stable thresholds to z-axis particle motion, up until the “deaf period.” Thresholds then begin to increase from this point up through the rest of metamorphic climax, and significantly fewer responsive sites can be located. The representation of particle motion in the auditory midbrain is less robust during later compared to earlier larval stages, overlapping with but also extending beyond the restricted “deaf period” for pressure stimulation. The decreased functional representation of particle motion in the auditory midbrain throughout metamorphic climax may reflect ongoing neural reorganization required to mediate the transition from underwater to amphibious life.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Traditional candidate gene approaches have thus far explained little of the molecular mechanisms underlying hibernation, likely due to (1) incomplete and imprecise sampling of a complex phenotype, and (2) the forming of hypotheses about which genes might be important based on studies of model organisms incapable of such dynamic physiology. Unbiased screening approaches, such as proteomics, offer an alternative means to discover the cellular underpinnings that permit successful hibernation and may reveal previously overlooked, important pathways. Here, we review the findings that have emerged from proteomics studies of hibernation. One striking feature is the stability of the proteome, especially across the extreme physiological shifts of torpor–arousal cycles during hibernation. This has led to subsequent investigations of the role of post-translational protein modifications in altering protein activity without energetically wasteful removal and rebuilding of protein pools. Another unexpected finding is the paucity of universal proteomic adjustments across organ systems in response to the extreme metabolic fluctuations despite the universality of their physiological challenges; rather each organ appears to respond in a unique, tissue-specific manner. Additional research is needed to extend and synthesize these results before it will be possible to address the whole body physiology of hibernation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In sessile mollusks, the only available behavioral option in dealing with salinity stress is to “clam up”, isolating their tissues from the environment. Though effective in the short term, prolonged isolation can have detrimental physiological consequences, particularly for females brooding embryos in a mantle cavity that is isolated from the external environment. In the Quempillén estuary, the Chilean oyster, Ostrea chilensis, spent nearly one-third of its brooding season at salinities low enough to cause female isolation. When females thus isolated themselves, the dissolved oxygen in their mantle cavity fluid dropped to hypoxic levels within 10 min. In females that were brooding embryos, this depletion of oxygen was not uniform: oxygen was depleted more quickly in the palp region (where embryos accumulate) than in the inhalant region. Additionally, oxygen was reduced even more quickly in the palp region when females were brooding late-stage embryos, which consumed oxygen significantly more quickly than embryos in earlier developmental stages. Finally, O. chilensis used anaerobic metabolism to cope with the hypoxia induced by isolation, as lactate accumulated in the tissues of both females (brooding > non-brooding) and embryos (late stage > early stage). Our findings demonstrate the trade-off between an adaptive avoidance behavior (clamming up) and the potentially detrimental consequences brought on by such a behavior (hypoxia). Cycling of embryos throughout the mantle cavity by deliberate female pumping keeps them from accumulating in the area between the palps, forestalling the creation of hypoxic conditions there. In addition, the capacity for anaerobic metabolism by both females and their embryos should help them tolerate the low oxygen levels that do eventually arise when the pallial cavity is isolated from the surrounding environment during long periods of reduced ambient salinity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Despite the presence of UCP1 orthologues prior to the divergence of teleost fish and mammalian lineages, UCP1’s significance for thermogenic adipose tissue emerged at later evolutionary stages. Recent studies on the presence of BAT in metatherians (marsupials) and eutherians of the afrotherian clade provide novel insights into the evolution of adaptive NST in mammals. In particular studies on the ‘protoendothermic’ lesser hedgehog tenrec (Afrotheria) suggest an evolutionary scenario linking BAT to the onset of eutherian endothermy.

Signal timing of both age categories was studied in acoustic interactions, and female preference was investigated in choice situations. Young male chirps were significantly shorter and contained less energy compared to “old chirps”. In mixed-age duets younger males timed their chirps as leader significantly more often. Females preferred the young male chirp when broadcast as leader over the old male chirp, but choice was random when the old male chirp was leader. This choice asymmetry was abolished after reducing the duration of the “old chirp”.

Yet odontocetes differ in the shape of the lower jaw suggesting that hearing pathways may vary between species, potentially influencing hearing directionality and noise impacts. This work measured the audiogram and received sensitivity of a Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) in an effort to comparatively examine how this species receives sound. Jaw hearing thresholds were lowest (most sensitive) at two locations along the anterior, midline region of the lower jaw (the lower jaw tip and anterior part of the throat). Responses were similarly low along a more posterior region of the lower mandible, considered the area of best hearing in bottlenose dolphins. Left- and right-side differences were also noted suggesting possible left–right asymmetries in sound reception or differences in ear sensitivities. The results indicate best hearing pathways may vary between the Risso’s dolphin and other odontocetes measured. This animal received sound well, supporting a proposed throat pathway.

Besides ruminants, camelids are the only herbivores that have evolved rumination as an obligatory physiological process consisting of repeated mastication of large food particles, which requires a particle sorting mechanism in the FS. Differences between camelids and ruminants have hardly been investigated so far. In this study we measured MRTs of solute and differently sized particles (2, 10, and 20 mm) and the ratio of large-to-small particle MRT, i.e. the selectivity factors (SF10/2mm, SF20/2mm, SF20/10mm), in three camelid species: alpacas (Vicugna pacos), llamas (Llama glama), and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus). The camelid data were compared with literature data from ruminants and non-ruminant foregut fermenters (NRFF). Camelids and ruminants both had higher SF10/2mmFS than NRFF, suggesting convergence in the function of the FS sorting mechanism in contrast to NRFF, in which such a sorting mechanism is absent. The SF20/10mmFS did not differ between ruminants and camelids, indicating that there is a particle size threshold of about 1 cm in both suborders above which particle retention is not increased. Camelids did not differ from ruminants in MRT2mmFS, MRTsoluteFS, and the ratio MRT2mmFS/MRTsoluteFS, but they were more similar to ‘cattle-’ than to ‘moose-type’ ruminants.

An antifreeze protein contributes to freeze point depression but, more importantly, cryoprotection is due to an elevation in osmotic pressure, by the accumulation of glycerol. The lower the water temperature, the higher the plasma glycerol with levels recorded as high as 400 mmol l−1. Glycerol freely diffuses out in direct relation to the glycerol concentration and fish may lose as much as 15 % of their glycerol reserve per day. Glycerol levels decrease from a maximum in February/March while water temperature is still sub-zero. The decrease in glycerol may respond to a photoperiod signal as opposed to initiation which is triggered by low temperature. The initial increase in glycerol level is supported by liver glycogen but high sustained glycerol level is dependent upon dietary carbohydrate and protein. The metabolic pathways leading to glycerol involve flux from glycogen/glucose to the level of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via the initial part of glycolysis and from amino acids via a truncated gluconeogenesis again to the level of DHAP. DHAP in turn is converted to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) and then directly to glycerol. The key to directing DHAP to G3P is a highly active glycerol 3-P dehydrogenase. G3P is converted directly to glycerol via G3P phosphatase, the rate-limiting step in the process. The transition to glycerol production is associated with increased activities of enzymes at key loci in the top part of glycogenolysis/glycolysis. Curtailment of the final section of glycolysis may reside at the level of pyruvate oxidation with an inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) driven by increased levels of PDH kinase. Enzymes associated with amino acid trafficking are elevated as is the pivotal enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The majority of research on the physiological stress response, and costs incurred to an animal, has focused on terrestrial species. This review presents current knowledge on the physiology of the stress response in a lesser studied group of mammals, the marine mammals. Marine mammals are an artificial or pseudo grouping from a taxonomical perspective, as this group represents several distinct and diverse orders of mammals. However, they all are fully or semi-aquatic animals and have experienced selective pressures that have shaped their physiology in a manner that differs from terrestrial relatives. What these differences are and how they relate to the stress response is an efflorescent topic of study. The identification of the many facets of the stress response is critical to marine mammal management and conservation efforts. Anthropogenic stressors in marine ecosystems, including ocean noise, pollution, and fisheries interactions, are increasing and the dramatic responses of some marine mammals to these stressors have elevated concerns over the impact of human-related activities on a diverse group of animals that are difficult to monitor. This review covers the physiology of the stress response in marine mammals and places it in context of what is known from research on terrestrial mammals, particularly with respect to mediator activity that diverges from generalized terrestrial models.

We trained Cataglyphis fortis foragers along a two-segment route to investigate whether they encode the lengths of route segments over which visual cues remain approximately constant. Our results support earlier studies suggesting that such route-segment odometry exists, and allows an individual to stop using a visual route memory at an appropriate point, even in the absence of any change in the visual surroundings. But we find that the behavioural effects of route-segment odometry are often complicated by interactions with guidance from the global path-integration system. If route-segment odometry and path-integration agree, they act together to produce a precise signal for search. If the endpoint of route-segment odometry arrives first, it does not trigger search but its effect can persist and cause guidance by path-integration to end early. Conversely, if ants start with their path-integration state at zero, they follow a route memory for no more than 3 m, irrespective of the route-segment length. A possible explanation for these results is that if one guidance system is made to overshoot its endpoint, it can cause the other to be cut short.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In a study of time-dependent response after being transferred from fresh water (0 ‰ NaCl, FW) to salt-dissolved brackish water (10 ‰ NaCl, SW), FW–SW, cortisol increased rapidly along with elevations of plasma glucose and lactate. Interestingly, plasma cortisol returned to baseline after prolonged exposure, followed by a second peak that probably enhanced the branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Under SW–FW condition, Na+/K+-ATPase activity was not altered as compared to SW-adapted fish. In conclusion, salinity change, especially FW–SW, induced a stress response and hence cortisol release in C. striata, which might increase plasma glucose and lactate to energize the branchial Na+/K+-ATPase.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Most accounts of this behaviour assume retinotopic image matching, e.g. recovering heading direction by finding a minimum in the image difference function as the viewpoint rotates. But most models neglect the potential image distortion that could result from unstable head motion. We report that for ants running across a short section of natural substrate, the head pitch varies substantially: by over 20 degrees with no load; and 60 degrees when carrying a large food item. There is no evidence of head stabilisation. Using a realistic simulation of the ant’s visual world, we demonstrate that this range of head pitch significantly degrades image matching. The effect of pitch variation can be ameliorated by a memory bank of densely sampled along a route so that an image sufficiently similar in pitch and location is available for comparison. However, with large pitch disturbance, inappropriate memories sampled at distant locations are often recalled and navigation along a route can be adversely affected. Ignoring images obtained at extreme pitches, or averaging images over several pitches, does not significantly improve performance.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Contrary to our expectations, dynamic up-tuning was found in the ear of the day-flying species Urania boisduvalii and Empyreuma pugione. Audiograms were measured with distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The level of the dominant distortion product (i.e. 2f1–f2) varied as a function of time by as much as 45 dB during ongoing acoustic stimulation, showing a systematic decrease at low frequencies and an increase at high frequencies. As a consequence, within about 2 s of acoustic stimulation, the DPOAEs audiogram shifted from low to high frequencies. Despite the up-tuning, the range of best audition still fell within the frequency band of the species-specific communication signals, suggesting that intra-specific communication should not be affected adversely. Up-tuning could be an ancestral condition in moth ears that in day-flying moths does not underlie larger selection pressure.

The motion detection system of insects has been widely studied with the majority of studies focussing on flies and bees. Here we characterize the contrast sensitivity of motion detection in the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola, an ambush predator that stays stationary for long periods of time while preying on fast-moving prey. In this, its visual behaviour differs from previously studied insects and we might therefore expect its motion detection system to differ from theirs. To investigate the sensitivity of the mantis we analyzed its optomotor response in response to drifting gratings with different contrasts and spatio-temporal frequencies. We find that the contrast sensitivity of the mantis depends on the spatial and temporal frequencies present in the stimulus and is separably tuned to spatial and temporal frequency rather than specifically to object velocity. Our results also suggest that mantises are sensitive to a broad range of velocities, in which they differ from bees and are more similar to hoverflies. We discuss our results in relation to the contrast sensitivities of other insects and the visual ecology of the mantis.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

There is thus a need to quantify this information content. Here we present one way of achieving this by constructing 3D models of natural environments using a laser scanner and purely camera-based methods that allow us to render panoramic views at any location. We provide (1) ground-truthing of such reconstructed views against panoramic images recorded at the same locations; (2) evidence of their potential to map the navigational information content of natural habitats; (3) methods to register these models with GPS or with stereo camera recordings and (4) examples of their use in reconstructing the visual information available to walking and flying insects. We discuss the current limitations of 3D modelling, including the lack of spectral and polarisation information, but also the opportunities such models offer to map the navigational information content of natural habitats and to test visual navigation algorithms under ‘real-life’ conditions.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

He has been invited to give a good number of named lectures across Europe, in the USA, and in India. And he has won his share of scientific prizes. These include the Karl Ritter von Frisch Medal from Germany (1994), the Marcel Benoist Prize from Switzerland (2002), and the King Faisal International Prize for Science from Saudi Arabia (2008). Among his many students over the years, 12 have attained full professorship, while one heads research at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, and one directs the Hansekolleg (Institute of Advanced Study in northern Germany). Rudiger Wehner has of course contributed much to the study of insect orientation and navigation. Our understanding of the polarisation compass, other compasses, path integration, the concept of matched filter (Wehner 1987), the use of landmarks by insects, and searching behaviour in ants have all benefitted from his contributions. We again need not give any more details here, as the first paper in this issue, by Cheng and Freas (2015), discuss this scientific legacy. Next comes another review on a topic that Rudiger Wehner has studied a lot: path integration. Mandyam Srinivasan, who has collaborated with Wehner on seminal work on the topic (Wehner and Srinivasan 1981, 2003), reviews path integration in bees and ants (Srinivasan 2015), two groups of animals that Wehner has studied. The directional component of path integration (a compass), the distance component (odometry), as well the integration component (putting direction and distance together to come up with a vector) are all discussed. In another review, on honeybees and their use of landmark information, Randolf Menzel and Uwe Greggers present what they suggest is cognitive mapping in bees (Menzel and Greggers 2015). The process is taken to work on travels over longer distances, other orienting mechanisms such as view matching playing a role closer to the goal. This special issue on Insect orientation and navigation honours the life and work of Rudiger Wehner, a frequent contributor to this journal and a champion of organismal biology. The occasion prompting this initiative was his 75th birthday, celebrated with his wife Sibylle Wehner in Sydney, Australia, in February while he was visiting one of us (KC) to collaborate on writing a paper and planning research on a new grant. A one-day symposium on Ecology, sensory processes, and cognition was also held in his honour at Macquarie University during that visit. Rudiger Wehner obtained his Ph.D. in 1967 under the supervision of Martin Lindauer at the University of Frankfurt, where one of his fellow students was Randolf Menzel. He became an assistant at the University of Zurich in 1967, before becoming Assistant Professor in 1970, and Full Professor in 1974. He has remained in Zurich ever since, with a long stint of dedicated service as the Head of the Zoologisches Institut (Department of Zoology). After becoming Professor Emeritus, he obtained a von Humboldt Award to collaborate with Wolfgang Rossler at the University of Wurzburg, a post that he has half-jokingly characterised as a post-professorial fellowship. To date, the collaboration is continuing on a series of research grants. He has had many collaborators over the years, including both of us guest editors, who owe chunks of our research career to our collaborations with him.

Queen-produced 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA) functions as both a social and sex pheromone, eliciting attraction in both female workers and male drones, but also affecting other critical aspects of worker physiology and behavior. These effects are also maturation related, as younger workers and sexually mature drones are most receptive to 9-ODA. While changes in the peripheral nervous system drive sex-related differences in sensitivity to 9-ODA, the mechanisms driving maturation-related shifts in receptivity to 9-ODA remain unknown. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that changes at the peripheral nervous system may be mediating plastic responses to 9-ODA by characterizing expression levels of AmOR11 (the olfactory receptor tuned to 9-ODA) and electrophysiological responses to 9-ODA. We find that receptor expression correlates significantly with behavioral receptivity to 9-ODA, with nurses and sexually mature drones exhibiting higher levels of expression than foragers and immature drones, respectively. Electrophysiological responses to 9-ODA were not found to correlate with behavioral receptivity or receptor expression, however. Thus, while receptor expression at the periphery exhibits a level of plasticity that correlates with behavior, the mechanisms driving maturation-dependent responsiveness to 9-ODA appear to function primarily in the central nervous system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Detailed comparisons of the central pattern generators (CPGs) underlying rhythmic feeding and swimming behaviors highlight the presence and effects of variation in neural circuits both across and within species. The feeding motor pattern of the snail, Lymnaea, is stereotyped, whereas the feeding motor pattern in the sea hare, Aplysia, is variable. However, the Aplysia motor pattern is regularized with operant conditioning or by mimicking learning using the dynamic clamp to change properties of CPG neurons. Swimming evolved repeatedly in marine gastropods. Distinct neural mechanisms underlie dissimilar forms of swimming, with homologous neurons playing different roles. However, even similar swimming behaviors in different species can be produced by distinct neural mechanisms, resulting from different synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons. Within a species, there can be variation in the strength and even valence of synapses, which does not have functional relevance under normal conditions, but can cause some individuals to be more susceptible to lesion of the circuit. This inter- and intra-species variation provides novel insights into CPG function and plasticity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis is a prominent example, covering large distances on foraging excursions. The stride integrator is probably the major source of path integration errors. A detailed analysis of walking behaviour in Cataglyphis is thus of importance for assessing possible sources of errors and potential compensation strategies. Zollikofer (J Exp Biol 192:95–106, 1994a) demonstrated consistent use of the tripod gait in Cataglyphis, and suggested an unexpectedly constant stride length as a possible means of reducing navigation errors. Here, we extend these studies by more detailed analyses of walking behaviour across a large range of walking speeds. Stride length increases linearly and stride amplitude of the middle legs increases slightly linearly with walking speed. An initial decrease of swing phase duration is observed at lower velocities with increasing walking speed. Then it stays constant across the behaviourally relevant range of walking speeds. Walking speed is increased by shortening of the stance phase and of the stance phase overlap. At speeds larger than 370 mms−1, the stride frequency levels off, the duty factor falls below 0.5, and Cataglyphis transitions to running with aerial phases.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, as path integration is error-prone, the ants in addition use visual and olfactory cues to pinpoint their nest entrance. It has been shown that the accuracy of the path integrator as well as the ants’ confidence in that egocentric navigational tool decreases with increasing foraging distance. Here, we show that despite the accumulating errors, even after far-reaching foraging runs path integration provides the ants with surprisingly accurate information regarding the nest position.

For temperate-zone mammals, hibernation is one such event, but little is known about its phenology. Hibernation consists of energy-saving torpor bouts interspersed with energetically expensive arousals to normothermic Tb, and hibernators should benefit from mechanisms which reduce arousal costs and help them time arousals to coincide with foraging opportunities. In a previous study, we showed that, in contrast to hibernating bats from warmer climates, little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) from central Canada abandon a circadian pattern to arousal in the middle of winter when there is no chance of feeding. Here, we used temperature telemetry to test whether they would re-synchronize arousals with normal foraging time (i.e. sunset) during late winter as the chance of foraging or emergence opportunities improves, and whether they would synchronize arousals with conspecifics, possibly to exploit social thermoregulation. We also used passive transponders to test whether energy reserves and/or sex differences in reproductive timing influence phenology and the sensitivity of emergence timing to environmental cues. In contrast to patterns in mid-winter, after 7 April 2013, bats synchronized arousals with sunset and with conspecifics. Females emerged earlier than males, and females in the best condition emerged first while body condition had no influence on male emergence timing. Both male and female bats appeared to time emergence with falling barometric pressure, a cue that predicts favourable foraging conditions for bats but which, unlike outside temperature, would have been readily detectable by bats inside the hibernaculum. Our results highlight hibernation traits associated with extreme winter energy limitation for insect-eating bats in cold climates and illustrate the influence of reproductive timing and environmental conditions on hibernation energetics and phenology.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We studied VS changes in the statocyst of the gastropod Helix aspersa immediately after 4-, 16-, and 32-day exposures to a 1.4G hypergravic field or following a 7-day recovery period. In the same animals we measured latencies of behavioral “negative gravitaxis” responses to a head-down pitch before and after centrifugation and found significant delays after 16- and 32-day runs. In an isolated neural preparation we recorded the electrophysiological responses of the statocyst nerve to static tilt (±19°) and sinusoids (±12°; 0.1 Hz). Spike sorting software was used to separate individual sensory cells’ patterns out of a common trace. In correspondence with behavior we observed a VS decrease in animals after 16- (p < 0.05) and 32-day (p < 0.01) centrifugations. These findings reveal the capability of statoreceptors to adjust their sensitivity in response to a prolonged change in the force of gravity. Interestingly, background discharge rate increased after 16 and 32 days in hypergravity and continued to rise through the recovery period. This result indicates that adaptive mechanisms to novel gravity levels were long lasting, and re-adaptation from hypergravity is a more complex process than just “return to normal”.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Total plasma ammonia (TAmm) and excretion rates of ammonia (JAmm) and urea-N (JUrea-N) were unaffected by NaCl or HCl. However, despite equal loading rates, plasma TAmm increased to a greater extent with NH4Cl, while JAmm increased to a greater extent with NH4HCO3 due to much greater increases in blood-to-water PNH3 gradients. As with HEA, both treatments caused large (90 %) elevations of JUrea-N, indicating that urea-N synthesis by the ornithine-urea cycle (OUC) is driven primarily by ammonia rather than HCO3−.

In this work, we determined the occurrence, biochemical characteristics, response to environmental salinity and dopamine of APN in the hepatopancreas of the euryhaline crab Neohelice granulata (Dana 1851) from the open mudflat of Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (Buenos Aires province, Argentina). APN activity was maximal at pH and temperature range of 7.6–9.0 and 37–45 °C, respectively. APN activity exhibited Michaelis–Menten kinetics (apparent Km = 0.19 ± 0.10 mM) (pH 7.6, 37 °C) and appeared to be sensitive to bestatin (I50 = 15 mM) and EDTA (I50 = 9 mM).

Corticosterone is of particular interest as a mediator of offspring sex because, as the primary stress hormone in birds, it regulates responses to environmental and social stimuli that trigger sex ratio biases. In previous studies in birds, chronic elevations of corticosterone stimulated female-biased sex ratios while acute pharmacological elevations that were provided 5 h prior to the expected time of ovulation stimulated male-biased sex ratios. Here, we aimed to determine the magnitude of corticosterone necessary to influence offspring sex and to further pinpoint the timing of the hormonal influence. Because high-dose injections of corticosterone stimulated male-biased sex ratios in hens, we hypothesized that females receiving acute pharmacological elevations of corticosterone would produce more male offspring while females with acute physiological elevations would produce an intermediate proportion of males compared to controls. We tested our hypotheses in laying hens by elevating corticosterone in the physiological or pharmacological range through injections of corticosterone administered 4 or 5 h prior to the expected time of ovulation. Contrary to our hypothesis, a physiological dose of corticosterone provided 5 h prior to the expected time of ovulation did not bias offspring sex ratios when compared to controls. Further, when corticosterone injections were given at 4 h prior to the expected time of ovulation, sex ratios were instead biased towards females. These results suggest that the timing and magnitude of the corticosterone elevation are both critical not only to whether a sex ratio bias occurs, but also the direction of the bias.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated the effects of each type of temperature change on reptilian cardiovascular regulation in red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta), a species known to experience marked seasonal changes in ambient temperature. Turtles were instrumented with occlusive catheters in the femoral artery and vein. Following an acclimation period of 10 days at 13 °C (131), cardiovascular responses to adrenaline, and the cardiac limb of the baroreflex were quantified. Ambient temperature was then reduced 1 °C day−1 until 3 °C was reached (31). Turtles were maintained at this temperature for 1-week before cardiovascular responses were reassessed. Turtles were then gradually (1 °C day−1) returned to an ambient temperature of 13 °C, (132). After a 1-week re-acclimation period, cardiovascular responses were again determined. Finally, 1-week post-pharmacological manipulation of turtles in the 132 treatment, ambient temperature was reduced to 3 °C over 24 h (32), and cardiovascular responses were again assessed. Temperature reduction from 131 to 31 decreased mean arterial blood pressure (Pm) and heart rate (fH) by ~38 and ~63 %, respectively. Acute temperature reduction, from 132 to 32, decreased fH similarly, ~66 %; however, while Pm decreased ~28 %, this was not significantly different than Pm at 132. The adrenaline injections increased fH ranging from 90 to 170 % at 13 °C which was a greater change than that observed at 3 °C ranging from a 40 to 70 % increase. The increase in Pm at the lowest dose of adrenaline did not differ across the temperature treatment groups. The operational point (set-point) Pm of the baroreflex was decreased similarly by both methods of temperature reduction (31 or 32). Further, a hypertensive cardiac baroreflex was absent in the majority of the animals studied independent of temperature. Baroreflex gain and normalized gain based on individual estimates of the relationship were decreased by temperature reduction similarly.

Female gray treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis and H. versicolor, discriminate against synthetic ‘calls’ possessing a single interpulse interval 2–3 three times the optimal value, suggesting that ICNs are important for call recognition. The calls of H. versicolor consist of pulses that are longer in duration, rise more slowly in amplitude and are repeated at a slower rate than those of H. chrysoscelis. Results of recordings from midbrain auditory neurons in these species include: (1) ICNs were found in both species and their temporal selectivity appeared to result from interplay between excitation and inhibition; (2) band-pass cells in H. versicolor were tuned to slower pulse rates than those in H. chrysoscelis; (3) ICNs that were selective for slow-rise pulse shape were found almost exclusively in H. versicolor, but fast-rise-selective neurons were found in both species, and (4) band-suppression ICNs in H. versicolor showed response minima at higher pulse rates than those in H. chrysoscelis.

However, the effects of small-world network structure on population’s encoding performance remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we applied a small world-based framework to quantify and analyze the response dynamics of cell assemblies recorded from rat primary visual cortex, and further established a population encoding model based on small world-based generalized linear model (SW-GLM). The electrophysiological experimental results show that the small world-based population responses to different topological shapes present significant variation (t test, p < 0.01; effect size: Hedge’s g > 0.8), while no significant variation was found for control networks without considering their spatial connectivity (t test, p > 0.05; effect size: Hedge’s g < 0.5). Furthermore, the numerical experimental results show that the predicted response under SW-GLM is more accurate and reliable compared to the control model without small-world structure, and the decoding performance is also improved about 10 % by taking the small-world structure into account. The above results suggest the important role of the small-world neural structure in encoding visual information for the neural population by providing electrophysiological and theoretical evidence, respectively.

In C. compressirostris, C. numenius, and C. tshokwe, all of which display biphasic EODs, the posterior face of the electrocytes forms evaginations merging to a stalk system receiving the innervation. In C. tamandua that emits a triphasic EOD, the small stalks of the electrocyte penetrate the electrocyte anteriorly before merging on the anterior side to receive the innervation. Additional differences in electrocyte anatomy among the former three species with the same EO geometry could be associated with further characteristics of their EODs. Furthermore, in C. numenius, ontogenetic changes in EO anatomy correlate with profound changes in the EOD. In the juvenile the anterior face of the electrocyte is smooth, whereas in the adult it exhibits pronounced surface foldings. This anatomical difference, together with disparities in the degree of stalk furcation, probably contributes to the about 12 times longer EOD in the adult.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Whilst mainly used with olfactory and tactile stimuli, more recently reliable PER conditioning has been achieved with visual stimuli such as colours and looming stripes. However, the results reported in different studies vary quite strongly, and it remains controversially discussed how to best condition visual PER. It is particularly striking that visual PER leads to more limited performance as compared to visual conditioning of free-flying bees. It could be that visual PER learning is affected by the lack of movement and that the presence of visual motion cues could compensate for it. We tested whether bees would show differences in learning performances when conditioned either with a colour and motion stimulus in combination or with colour alone. Colour acquisition was improved in the presence of the motion stimulus. The result is consistent with the idea that visual learning might be tightly linked to movement in bees, given that they use vision predominantly during flight. Our results further confirm recent findings that successful visual PER conditioning in bees is achievable without obligatorily removing the antennae.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this study, Pacific bluefin tuna were trained to respond to a pure tone sound stimulus ranging 325–800 Hz and their hearing abilities quantified using a staircase psychophysical technique.

In the present study, duration tuning was examined in the auditory cortex of M. molossus to describe if it is as ambiguous as the collicular tuning. From a population of 174 cortical 104 (60 %) neurons did not show duration selectivity (all-pass). Around 5 % (9 units) responded preferentially to stimuli having longer durations showing long-pass duration response functions, 35 (20 %) responded to a narrow range of stimulus durations showing band-pass duration response functions, 24 (14 %) responded most strongly to short stimulus durations showing short-pass duration response functions and two neurons (1 %) responded best to two different stimulus durations showing a two-peaked duration–response function. The majority of neurons showing short- (16 out of 24) and band-pass (24 out 35) selectivity displayed “O-shaped” duration response areas. In contrast to the inferior colliculus, duration tuning in the auditory cortex of M. molossus appears level tolerant. That is, the type of duration selectivity and the stimulus duration eliciting the maximum response were unaffected by changing sound level.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Sodium and calcium concentrations strongly affect both sea–land orientation and the sun compass mechanism in T.saltator, whereas the behaviour of T. ugolinii is less influenced. The absence of Na+ does not influence the sun compass mechanism, but causes an inversion in the mean direction of orientation in T. saltator. In T. ugolinii, there was no influence on the compass mechanism for solar orientation and no inversion in the directional choice. In the absence of Ca2+, a photonegative tendency was observed for T saltator together with marked reduction in the capacity to go in any direction. However, the effect of Ca2+ absence on the orientation capacity of T. saltator is reversible and the orientation capacity can be reduced in a few minutes.

The current study examined how ecologically relevant variation in light intensity [0–800 lux (lx)] influences detection of prey (mobile, immobile) in each species by analyzing six behavioral parameters. Both species fed at light intensities ≥1 lx and trends in behavior among light intensities were informative. However, prey type and/or time of day (but not light intensity) predicted all four parameters analyzed with generalized linear mixed models in A. stuartgranti, whereas the interaction of light intensity and time of day predicted three of these parameters in Tramitichromis sp. Data suggest that the critical light intensity is 1–12 lx for both species, that the integration of visual and lateral line input explains differences in detection of mobile and immobile prey and behavioral changes at the transition from 1 to 0 lx in A. stuartgranti, and that Tramitichromis sp. likely uses binocular vision to locate prey.

In both eye regions, one photoreceptor per ommatidium, R7, has a long visual fiber projecting through the lamina to the medulla. Axonal fibers from R7 receptors of the dorsal rim area have short side branches throughout the depth of the dorsal lamina and maintain retinotopic projections to the dorsal medulla following the first optic chiasma.

To study sensitisation, wasps were trained by one drilling in a host without cinnamon. These wasps were not attracted to cinnamon immediately afterwards. Obviously, sensitisation is not involved in early memory. Wasps that were anaesthetised by CO2 directly after associative training did not react to cinnamon 30–45 min later, but after 1 and 24 h. CO2 treatment ≥5 min after training did not erase the reaction to cinnamon. This indicates the existence of four early memory phases.

This approach will be used here to characterize components of navigation in a flying insect, the honeybee. However, navigation studies need to go beyond an analysis of behavioral routines to come up with a synthesis. We will defend the concept of an active memory structure guiding navigation in bees that is best described as a mental or cognitive map. In our opinion, spatial/temporal relations of landmarks are stored in a mental map in such a way that behavioral routines such as expectation and planning, as indicated by shortcutting, are possible. We view the mental map of animals including the honeybee as an “action memory of spatial relations” rather than as a sensory representation as we humans experience it by introspection. Two components characterize the mental map, the relational representation of landmarks and the meaning of locations to the animal. As yet, there is little data to suggest that bees assign meaning to the experienced locations. To explore this possibility, further studies will be needed, whereby honeybees provide a unique model to address this question.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These neurophysiologically complex marine invertebrates can camouflage themselves against almost any background, yet their ability to quickly (0.5–2 s) alter their body patterns on different visual backgrounds poses a vexing challenge: how to pick the correct body pattern amongst their repertoire. The ability of cuttlefish to change appropriately requires a visual system that can rapidly assess complex visual scenes and produce the motor responses—the neurally controlled body patterns—that achieve camouflage. Using specifically designed visual backgrounds and assessing the corresponding body patterns quantitatively, we and others have uncovered several aspects of scene variation that are important in regulating cuttlefish patterning responses. These include spatial scale of background pattern, background intensity, background contrast, object edge properties, object contrast polarity, object depth, and the presence of 3D objects. Moreover, arm postures and skin papillae are also regulated visually for additional aspects of concealment. By integrating these visual cues, cuttlefish are able to rapidly select appropriate body patterns for concealment throughout diverse natural environments. This sensorimotor approach of studying cuttlefish camouflage thus provides unique insights into the mechanisms of visual perception in an invertebrate image-forming eye.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Envelope and fine-structure processing were quantified using the envelope following response (EFR) and frequency following response (FFR). We predicted stronger EFRs in the open-habitat species based on broader auditory filters and greater amplitude modulation of vocal signals in this group. We predicted stronger FFRs in woodland species based on narrower auditory filters. As predicted, EFR amplitude was generally greatest in the open habitat species. FFR amplitude, in contrast, was greatest in white-crowned sparrows with no clear difference between habitats. This result cannot be fully explained by species differences in audiogram shape and might instead reflect greater acoustic complexity of songs in the white-crowned sparrow. Finally, we observed stronger FFRs in woodland species when tones were broadcast with the next higher harmonic in the complex. Thus, species such as nuthatches that have songs with strong harmonics may process these sounds using enhanced spectral processing instead of enhanced amplitude-envelope processing. The results suggest coevolution between signal design and temporal processing of complex signals and underscore the need to study auditory processing with a diversity of signals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This activation, probably not related to the control of food intake through FA sensor systems but to the modulation of lipolysis in peripheral tissues, liver and Brockmann bodies (BB, the main site of pancreatic endocrine cells in fish), would target the restoration of FA levels in plasma. To assess this hypothesis, we lowered circulating FA levels by treating fish with SDZ alone, or SDZ in the presence of metyrapone (an inhibitor of cortisol synthesis). In liver, the changes observed were not compatible with a direct FA-sensing response but with a stress response, which allows us to suggest that the detection of a FA decrease in the hypothalamus elicits a counter-regulatory response in liver, resulting in an activation of lipolysis to restore FA levels in plasma. The activation of these metabolic changes in liver could be attributable to the activation of the HPI axis and/or to the action of sympathetic pathways. In contrast, in BB, changes in circulating FA levels induce changes in several parameters compatible with the function of FA-sensing systems informing about the decrease in circulating FA levels.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we used a bee-attractive fluorescent blue trap as a model for analyzing visual signals in operation outdoors, and across bee species. We manipulated trap color (appearance to humans under light with weak UV component) and UV-induced fluorescence emission, and aligned field capture results with bee vision models. Our studies show that the bees were attracted to traps that under solar illumination exhibited strong fluorescence emission exclusively in the blue spectral region. Through quantitative analysis, we established that strong spectral overlap of trap emittance with the photosensitivity characteristic of the blue receptor type and minimal overlap with those of the other two receptor types is the most critical property of attractive traps. A parameter has been identified which predicts the degree of attractiveness of the traps and which captures trends in the field data across wild bee species and for a diversity of backgrounds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To test this hypothesis we analyzed the composition of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in seven different populations of Enchytraeus albidus originating from different thermal environments. The seven populations differ markedly in origin (polar-temperate) and are also characterized by marked difference in cold tolerance. The dominant PLFAs of E. albidus were C20:5, C20:4 and C20:2 (53–61 % of total PLFA) followed by C18:0, C20:1 and C22:2 (17–20 % of total PLFA). As hypothesized the PLFA composition varied significantly between populations and molar percentage of several of the PLFAs (particularly C18:2) correlated with the lower lethal temperature (LT50) of the seven populations. Unsaturation ratio (UFA/SFA) and average PLFA chain length also correlated significantly with LT50, such that cold sensitive populations had a shorter chain length and a lower UFA/SFA compared to cold tolerant populations. Reconstituted membranes of the least and most cold tolerant populations were used to compare membranes’ physical properties by fluorescence anisotropy and bending rigidity. Measurements of anisotropy did not show any overall difference between populations with different cold tolerance. This could be interpreted as if E. albidus populations have achieved a similar “optimal” fluidity of the membrane with a somewhat different PLFA composition. Our study suggests that membrane lipid composition could be important for the cold tolerance of E. albidus; however, these differences are not easily differentiated in the measurements of the membranes’ physical properties.

Extended landmarks, such as walls and channels, may serve further functions, for example, local guidance or triggering of local vectors. The roles of such structures were usually examined in homing animals but not during food searches. When searching for familiar feeding sites, Cataglyphis may show intriguing deviations from expected search performances. These may result from the presence of extended landmarks, namely experimental channels. Here we scrutinise this hypothesis of landmark guidance in food searches. We prevented the ants from seeing the channel walls by covering their eyes, except the dorsal rim area. This experiment was repeated in the open test field with an alley of black cylinders to extend our findings to a more normal foraging environment. Ants with covered eyes did not deviate from expected search performances, whereas ants with normal eyes extended their searches along the axis of the leading structures by 15–20 %, in both channels and landmark alleys.

It has influenced the study of polarisation vision in other systems, and led Wehner to formulate the concept of a matched filter. The matched filter has probably had earlier formulations, but Wehner’s paper on it has been much cited in studies on navigation and in other fields. The polarisation compass serves the task of path integration in insects. Work on path integration took off in the 1980s with work on desert ants and rodents. The use of terrestrial visual cues, landmarks or the panorama in view-based matching is another major theme of navigational research today.

There are ~20 different types of ganglion cells, each encoding a specific aspect of the visual scene as spatial and temporal contrast, orientation, direction of movement, presence of looming stimuli; etc. Ganglion cell functioning depends on the intrinsic properties of ganglion cell’s membrane as well as on the excitatory and inhibitory inputs that these cells receive from other retinal neurons. GABA is one of the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitters in the retina. How it modulates the activity of different types of ganglion cells and what is its significance in extracting the basic features from visual scene are questions with fundamental importance in visual neuroscience.

Nonpathological body weight cycling and the ability to tolerate food deficiency make this species a unique subject for studying physiological mechanisms in energy metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor regulating energy homeostasis. During acute fasting, AMPK promotes fatty acid oxidation and enhances glucose uptake. We evaluated the effects of prolonged fasting on muscle energy metabolism in farm-bred raccoon dogs. Total and phosphorylated AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4), insulin receptor and protein kinase B (Akt) protein expressions of hind limb muscles were determined by Western blot after 10 weeks of fasting. Plasma insulin, leptin, ghrelin, glucose and free fatty acid levels were measured, and muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform composition analyzed. Fasting had no effects on AMPK phosphorylation, but total AMPK expression decreased in m. rectus femoris, m. tibialis anterior and m. extensor digitorum longus resulting in a higher phosphorylation ratio. Decreased total expression was also observed for ACC. Fasting did not influence GLUT 4, insulin receptor or Akt expression, but Akt phosphorylation was lower in m. flexor digitorum superficialis and m. extensor digitorum longus.

In response, some specialist herbivores have evolved digestive enzymes that are resistant to inhibition. Monoterpenes, a class of PSMs, have not been investigated with respect to the interference of specific digestive enzymes, nor have such interactions been studied in avian herbivores. We investigated this interaction in the Greater Sage-Grouse (Phasianidae: Centrocercus urophasianus), which specializes on monoterpene-rich sagebrush species (Artemisia spp.). We first measured the monoterpene concentrations in gut contents of free-ranging sage-grouse. Next, we compared the ability of seven individual monoterpenes present in sagebrush to inhibit a protein-digesting enzyme, aminopeptidase-N. We also measured the inhibitory effects of PSM extracts from two sagebrush species. Inhibition of aminopeptidase-N in sage-grouse was compared to inhibition in chickens (Gallus gallus). We predicted that sage-grouse enzymes would retain higher activity when incubated with isolated monoterpenes or sagebrush extracts than chicken enzymes. We detected unchanged monoterpenes in the gut contents of free-ranging sage-grouse. We found that three isolated oxygenated monoterpenes (borneol, camphor, and 1,8-cineole) inhibited digestive enzymes of both bird species. Camphor and 1,8-cineole inhibited enzymes from chickens more than from sage-grouse. Extracts from both species of sagebrush had similar inhibition of chicken enzymes, but did not inhibit sage-grouse enzymes.

We used the frequency of licking and grooming behavior to distinguish low paternal responsiveness and high paternal responsiveness in virgin mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus). Males that engaged in high paternal behavior had elevated levels of OT immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus compared with males that displayed low paternal behavior. Likewise, males of high paternal responsiveness had more ERα immunoreactive neurons in the medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and medial amygdaloid nucleus compared to low responsive males.
