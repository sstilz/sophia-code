To reveal the unique physical features of repeat proteins we have studied the structural and mechanical properties of three repeats of chicken brain α-spectrin (R15, R16 and R17) at the atomic level under stretching at constant velocities (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 Å·ps-1) and constant forces (700 and 900 pN) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at T = 300 K. 114 independent MD simulations were performed and their analysis has been done. Despite structural similarity of these domains we have found that R15 is less mechanically stable than R16, which is less stable than R17. This result is in agreement with the thermal unfolding rates. Moreover, we have observed the relationship between mechanical stability, flexibility of the domains and the number of aromatic residues involved in aromatic clusters.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Little is known, however, about their materials properties and associated organic matrix, or their correlation to breast cancer prognosis. We combine histopathology, Raman microscopy, and electron microscopy to image MCs within snap-frozen human breast tissue and generate micron-scale resolution correlative maps of crystalline phase, trace metals, particle morphology, and organic matrix chemical signatures within high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive cancer. We reveal the heterogeneity of mineral-matrix pairings, including punctate apatitic particles (<2 µm) with associated trace elements (e.g., F, Na, and unexpectedly Al) distributed within the necrotic cores of DCIS, and both apatite and spheroidal whitlockite particles in invasive cancer within a matrix containing spectroscopic signatures of collagen, non-collagen proteins, cholesterol, carotenoids, and DNA. Among the three DCIS samples, we identify key similarities in MC morphology and distribution, supporting a dystrophic mineralization pathway. This multimodal methodology lays the groundwork for establishing MC heterogeneity in the context of breast cancer biology, and could dramatically improve current prognostic models.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Specialized cells, the photocytes, contain light emitting machineries, the photosomes. Successive stimulations induce light intensity variations and show a coupling within and between photosomes. Here, we describe, using electron tomography of cryo-substituted elytra and freeze-fracturing, the structural transition associated to light emission: undulating tubules come closer, organize and their number forming photosomes increases. Two repeating undulating tubules in opposite phase compose the photosome. Undulations are located on three hexagonal layers that regularly repeat and are equally displaced, in x y and z. The tubule membranes within layers merge giving rise to rings that tend to obey to quasi-rhombohedral symmetry. Merging may result either from close-association, hemifusion (one leaflet fusion) or from fusion (two leaflets fusion). Although the resolution of tomograms is not sufficient to distinguish these three cases, freeze-fracturing shows that hemifusion is a frequent process that leads to an reversible anastomosed membrane complex favoring communications, appearing as a major coupling factor of photosome light emission.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These crystallography and electron microscopy studies used detergent as a membrane mimetic and revealed structural variations in the central domain, BamA, as well as in the lipoprotein BamC. We have used cellular solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine the entire BamABCDE complex in native outer membranes and obtained data on the BamCDE subcomplex in outer membranes, in addition to synthetic bilayers. To reduce spectral crowding, we utilized proton-detected experiments and employed amino-acid specific isotope-labelling in (13C, 13C) correlation experiments. Taken together, the results provide insight into the overall fold and assembly of the BAM complex in native membranes, in particular regarding the structural flexibility of BamC in the absence of the core unit BamA.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This includes cellular dynamics where three subfamilies, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are known to regulate cell shape and migration though coordinate action. Activation of Rho proteins largely depends on Rho Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs) through a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain linked to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that subserves various functions. The PH domains from Lbc RhoGEFs, which specifically activate RhoA, have been shown to bind to activated RhoA. Here, p190RhoGEF is shown to also bind Rac1·GTP. Crystal structures reveal that activated Rac1 and RhoA use their effector-binding surfaces to associate with the same hydrophobic surface on the PH domain. Both activated RhoA and Rac1 can stimulate exchange of nucleotide on RhoA by localization of p190RhoGEF to its substrate, RhoA·GDP, in vitro. The binding of activated RhoA provides a mechanism for positive feedback regulation as previously proposed for the family of Lbc RhoGEFs. In contrast, the novel interaction between activated Rac1 and p190RhoGEF reveals a potential mechanism for cross-talk regulation where Rac can directly effect stimulation of RhoA. The greater capacity of Rac1 to stimulate p190RhoGEF among the Lbc RhoGEFs suggests functional specialization.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The computer program is fast and has low computational requirements. In addition to helix coordinates required for a subsequent helical reconstruction work-flow, we determine the persistence length of the polymer ensemble.

We know little about the fine details of these structures in 3D at the length scales of their basic building blocks, the inherent variations of structure within a tissue and the cell-extracellular tissue interfaces. This limits progress in understanding tissue formation, relating structure to mechanical and metabolic functions, and obtaining deeper insights into pathologies and the evolution of these tissues. In this perspective we identify and discuss a series of open questions pertaining to collagen containing vertebrate mineralized tissues that can be addressed using appropriate 3D structural determination methods.

This study examined the effects of disrupting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling through BMP receptors on bone quantity and bone quality. More specifically, we disrupted two BMP receptors, Acvr1 and Bmpr1a, respectively, in Osterix-expressing osteogenic progenitor cells in mice. We examined the structural changes to the femora from 3-month old male and female conditional knockout (cKO) mice using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology, as well as compositional changes to both cortical and trabecular compartments of bone using Raman spectroscopy. We found that the deletion of Acvr1 and Bmpr1a, respectively, in an osteoblast-specific manner resulted in higher bone mass in the trabecular compartment. Disruption of Bmpr1a resulted in a more significantly increased bone mass in the trabecular compartment. We also found that these cKO mice showed lower mineral-to-matrix ratio, while tissue mineral density was lower in the cortical compartment. Collagen crosslink ratio was higher in both cortical and trabecular compartments of male cKO mice. Our study suggested that BMP signaling in osteoblast mediated by BMP receptors, namely ACVR1 and BMPR1A, is critical in regulating bone quantity and bone quality.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We studied the morphology and size of the basic structural unit, the secondary layer fibre, of the shells of several extant brachiopod taxa to derive a model correlating microstructural patterns to environmental conditions. Twenty-one adult specimens of six recent brachiopod species adapted to different environmental conditions, from Antarctica, to New Zealand, to the Mediterranean Sea, were chosen for microstructural analysis using SEM, TEM and EBSD. We conclude that: 1) there is no significant difference in the shape and size of the fibres between ventral and dorsal valves, 2) there is an ontogenetic trend in the shape and size of the fibres, as they become larger, wider, and flatter with increasing age. This indicates that the fibrous layer produced in the later stages of growth, which is recommended by the literature to be the best material for geochemical analyses, has a different morphostructure and probably a lower organic content than that produced earlier in life. In two species of the same genus living in seawater with different temperature and carbonate saturation state, a relationship emerged between the microstructure and environmental conditions. Fibres of the polar Liothyrella uva tend to be smaller, rounder and less convex than those of the temperate Liothyrella neozelanica, suggesting a relationship between microstructural size, shell organic matter content, ambient seawater temperature and calcite saturation state.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The seven transmembrane (TM) helices of the receptors were taken as a whole; thus the model quality within the 7TM domains has not been evaluated. Here we evaluate the 7TM domain structures in the models submitted for the last round of prediction - GPCR Dock 2013. Applying the 7 × 7 RMSD matrix analysis described in our prior work, we show that the models vary widely in prediction accuracy of the 7TM structures, exhibiting diverse structural differences from the targets. For the prediction of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, the top 7TM models are rather close to the targets, which however are not ranked top by ligand-docking. On the other hand, notable deviations of the TMs are found in in the previously identified top docking models that closely resemble other receptors. We further reveal reasons of success and failure in ligand docking for the models. This current assessment not only complements the previous assessment, but also provides important insights into the current status of GPCR modeling and ligand docking.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Fab fragments from antibodies can be used as labeling reagents during EM visualization without gene manipulation of the target protein, but this method requires a panel of high-affinity antibodies that recognize a wide variety of epitopes. Linear peptide tags and their anti-tag antibodies can be used but they have a limited mapping ability as their placement is usually limited to the terminal regions of a protein. The PA dodecapeptide epitope tag (GVAMPGAEDDVV), forms a tight β-turn in the antigen binding pocket of its antibody (NZ-1). This capability allows for insertion of the PA tag into various surface-exposed loops within a multi-domain cell adhesion receptor, αIIbβ3 integrin. We confirmed that the purified PA-tagged integrin ectodomain fragments can form a stable complex with NZ-1 Fab. Negative stain EM of the various integrin-NZ-1 complexes revealed that a majority of the particles exhibited a clear density corresponding to the NZ-1 Fab; and the positions of the bound Fab were in good agreement with the predicted location of the inserted PA tag. The high-affinity and insertion-compatibility of the PA tag system allowed us to develop a new EM labeling methodology applicable to proteins for which good antibodies are not available.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although the structure of Escherichia coli QFR was first reported almost twenty years ago, many open questions of catalysis remain. Here we report two new crystal forms of QFR, one grown from the lipidic cubic phase and one grown from dodecyl maltoside micelles. QFR crystals grown from the lipid cubic phase processed as P1, merged to 7.5 Å resolution, and exhibited crystal packing similar to previous crystal forms. Crystals grown from dodecyl maltoside micelles processed as P21, merged to 3.35 Å resolution, and displayed a unique crystal packing. This latter crystal form provides the first view of the E. coli QFR active site without a dicarboxylate ligand. Instead, an unidentified anion binds at a shifted position. In one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit, this is accompanied by rotation of the capping domain of the catalytic subunit. In the other molecule, this is associated with loss of interpretable electron density for this same capping domain. Analysis of the structure suggests that the ligand adjusts the position of the capping domain.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Strong interactions form well defined interfaces but weak interactions are more dynamic and variable. Weak interactions can collectively lead to large structures such as microvilli via cooperativity and are often the precursors of much stronger interactions, e.g. the initial actin-myosin interaction during muscle contraction. Electron tomography combined with subvolume alignment and classification is an ideal method for the study of weak interactions because a 3-D image is obtained for the individual interactions, which subsequently are characterized collectively. Here we describe a method to characterize heterogeneous F-actin-aldolase interactions in 2-D rafts using electron tomography. By forming separate averages of the two constituents and fitting an atomic structure to each average, together with the alignment information which relates the raw motif to the average, an atomic model of each crosslink is determined and a frequency map of contact residues is computed. The approach should be applicable to any large structure composed of constituents that interact weakly and heterogeneously.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The molecular machines that catalyze this process are known as ATP-dependent proteases with examples that include ClpAP and ClpCP. Clp/Hsp100 subunits form ring-structures that couple the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to protein unfolding and subsequent translocation of denatured protein into the compartmentalized ClpP protease for degradation. Copies of the clpA, clpC, clpE, clpK, and clpL genes are present in all characterized bacteria and their gene products are highly conserved in structure and function. However, the evolutionary relationship between these proteins remains unclear. Here we report a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis that suggests divergent evolution yielded ClpA from an ancestral ClpC protein and that ClpE/ClpL represent intermediates between ClpA/ClpC. This analysis also identifies a group of proteobacterial ClpC proteins that are likely not functional in regulated proteolysis.

To achieve cryo-FM, a trade-off must be made between the temperature and performance of objective lens. The temperature of specimen should be kept below devitrification while the distance between the objective lens and specimen should be short enough for high resolution imaging. Although special objective lens was designed in many current cryo-FM approaches, the unavoided frosting and ice contamination are still affecting the efficiency of cryo-CLEM. In addition, the correlation accuracy between cryo-FM and cryo-EM would be reduced during the current specimen transfer procedure. Here, we report an improved cryo-CLEM technique (high-vacuum optical platform for cryo-CLEM, HOPE) based on a high-vacuum optical stage and a commercial cryo-EM holder. The HOPE stage comprises of a special adapter to suit the cryo-EM holder and a high-vacuum chamber with an anti-contamination system. It provides a clean and enduring environment for cryo specimen, while the normal dry objective lens in room temperature can be used via the optical windows. The 'touch-free' specimen transfer via cryo-EM holder allows least specimen deformation and thus maximizes the correlation accuracy between cryo-FM and cryo-EM.

In this study, a comparison of bone material properties was made for lines of hens created by divergent selection to have high and low bone strength and housed in either individual cages, with restricted mobility, or in an aviary system, with opportunity for increased mobility. Improvement of bone biomechanics in the high line hens and in aviary housing was mainly due to increased bone mass, thicker cortical bone and more medullary bone. However, bone material properties such as cortical and medullary bone mineral composition and crystallinity as well as collagen maturity did not differ between lines. However, bone material properties of birds from the different type of housing were markedly different. The cortical bone in aviary birds had a lower degree of mineralization and bone mineral was less mature and less organized than in caged birds. These differences can be explained by increased bone turnover rates due to the higher physical activity of aviary birds that stimulates bone formation and bone remodeling. Multivariate statistical analyses shows that both cortical and medullary bone contribute to breaking strengthThe cortical thickness was the single most important contributor while its degree of mineralization and porosity had a smaller contribution. Bone properties had poorer correlations with mechanical properties in cage birds than in aviary birds presumably due to the greater number of structural defects of cortical bone in cage birds.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The earliest detailed model based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and X-ray crystallography postulated that higher actin affinity and lever arm movement were coupled to closure of a feature of the myosin head dubbed the actin-binding cleft. Several studies since then using crystallography of myosin-V and cryoEM structures of F-actin bound myosin-I, -II and -V have provided details of this model. The smooth muscle myosin II interaction with F-actin may differ from those for striated and non-muscle myosin II due in part to different lengths of important surface loops. Here we report a ∼6 Å resolution reconstruction of F-actin decorated with the nucleotide-free recombinant smooth muscle myosin-II motor domain (MD) from images recorded using a direct electron detector. Resolution is highest for F-actin and the actin-myosin interface (3.5-4 Å) and lowest (∼6-7 Å) for those parts of the MD at the highest radius. Atomic models built into the F-actin density are quite comparable to those previously reported for rabbit muscle actin and show density from the bound ADP. The atomic model of the MD, is quite similar to a recently published structure of vertebrate non-muscle myosin II bound to F-actin and a crystal structure of nucleotide free myosin-V. Larger differences are observed when compared to the cryoEM structure of F-actin decorated with rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1. The differences suggest less closure of the 50 kDa domain in the actin bound skeletal muscle myosin structure.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Central to this process is the ability to automate tomogram segmentation to identify sub-cellular components, facilitate molecular docking and annotate detected objects with associated metadata. Here we demonstrate that RAZA (Rapid 3D z-crossings algorithm) provides a robust, accurate, intuitive, fast, and generally applicable segmentation algorithm capable of detecting organelles, membranes, macromolecular assemblies and extrinsic membrane protein domains. RAZA defines each continuous contour within a tomogram as a discrete object and extracts a set of 3D structural fingerprints (major, middle and minor axes, surface area and volume), enabling selective, semi-automated segmentation and object extraction. RAZA takes advantage of the fact that the underlying algorithm is a true 3D edge detector, allowing the axes of a detected object to be defined, independent of its random orientation within a cellular tomogram. The selectivity of object segmentation and extraction can be controlled by specifying a user-defined detection tolerance threshold for each fingerprint parameter, within which segmented objects must fall and/or by altering the number of search parameters, to define morphologically similar structures. We demonstrate the capability of RAZA to selectively extract subgroups of organelles (mitochondria) and macromolecular assemblies (ribosomes) from cellular tomograms. Furthermore, the ability of RAZA to define objects and their contours, provides a basis for molecular docking and rapid tomogram annotation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Many of these proteins are comprised of tandem arrays of β-hairpins. Today, the amount and variety of the data on these β-hairpin repeat (BHR) structures have reached a level that requires detailed analysis and further classification. In this paper, we classified the BHR proteins, compared structures, sequences of repeat motifs, functions and distribution across the major taxonomic kingdoms of life and within organisms. As a result, we identified six different BHR folds in tandem repeat proteins of Class III (elongated structures) and one BHR fold (up-and-down β-barrel) in Class IV (""closed"" structures). Our survey reveals the high incidence of the BHR proteins among bacteria and viruses and their possible relationship to the structures of amyloid fibrils. It indicates that BHR folds will be an attractive target for future structural studies, especially in the context of age-related amyloidosis and emerging infectious diseases.

The phenomenon of stretch activation underlies the function of asynchronous flight muscle. It is most highly developed in flight muscle, but is also observed in other striated muscles such as cardiac muscle. Although stretch activation is likely to be complex, involving more than a single structural aspect of striated muscle, the thick filament itself, would be a prime site for regulatory function because it must bear all of the tension produced by both its associated myosin motors and any externally applied force. Here we show the first structural evidence that the arrangement of myosin heads within the interacting heads motif is coupled to the structure of the thick filament backbone. We find that a change in helical angle of 0.16° disorders the blocked head preferentially within the Lethocerus interacting heads motif. This observation suggests a mechanism for how tension affects the dynamics of the myosin heads leading to a detailed hypothesis for stretch activation and shortening deactivation, in which the blocked head preferentially binds the thin filament followed by the free head when force production occurs.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Our results indicate that Lysinibacillus sp. strain GW-2 can induce the formation of vaterite with spherical morphology from an amorphous calcium carbonate precursor. Biogenic vaterite was more stable than chemically synthesized vaterite in distilled water, perhaps due to organic matter secreted by bacteria that enwrapped the vaterite and prevented it from transforming into more stable phases.

The proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal assignment of orientations that simultaneously respects all common lines between all images. The contribution of each common line to the estimated orientations is weighted according to a statistical model for common lines' detection errors. The key property of the proposed algorithm is that it finds the global optimum for the orientations given the common lines. In particular, any local optima in the common lines energy landscape do not affect the proposed algorithm. As a result, it is applicable to thousands of images at once, very robust to noise, completely reference free, and not biased towards any initial model. A byproduct of the algorithm is a set of measures that allow to asses the reliability of the obtained ab initio model. We demonstrate the algorithm using class averages from two experimental data sets, resulting in ab initio models with resolutions of 20Å or better, even from class averages consisting of as few as three raw images per class.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The genetic expansion of the polyQ tract in disease-related proteins triggers a series of events resulting in neurodegeneration. The polyQ tract plays the leading role in the aggregation mechanism, but other elements modulate the aggregation propensity in the context of the full-length proteins, as implied by variations in the length of the polyQ tract required to trigger the onset of a given polyQ disease. Intrinsic features such as the presence of aggregation-prone regions (APRs) outside the polyQ segments and polyQ-flanking sequences, which synergistically participate in the aggregation process, are emerging for several disease-related proteins. The inherent polymorphic structure of polyQ stretches places the polyQ proteins in a central position in protein-protein interaction networks, where interacting partners may additionally shield APRs or reshape the aggregation course. Expansion of the polyQ tract perturbs the cellular homeostasis and contributes to neuronal failure by modulating protein-protein interactions and enhancing toxic oligomerization. Post-translational modifications further regulate self-assembly either by directly altering the intrinsic aggregation propensity of polyQ proteins, by modulating their interaction with different macromolecules or by modifying their withdrawal by the cell quality control machinery. Here we review the recent data on the multifaceted aggregation pathways of disease-related polyQ proteins, focusing on ataxin-3, the protein mutated in Machado-Joseph disease.

Collagens in the tessellated endoskeletons of cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays).,"The primary skeletal tissue in elasmobranchs -sharks, rays and relatives- is cartilage, forming both embryonic and adult endoskeletons. Only the skeletal surface calcifies, exhibiting mineralized tiles (tesserae) sandwiched between a cartilage core and overlying fibrous perichondrium. These two tissues are based on different collagens (Coll II and I, respectively), fueling a long-standing debate as to whether tesserae are more like calcified cartilage or bone (Coll 1-based) in their matrix composition. We demonstrate that stingray (Urobatis halleri) tesserae are bipartite, having an upper Coll I-based 'cap' that merges into a lower Coll II-based 'body' zone, although tesserae are surrounded by cartilage. We identify a 'supratesseral' unmineralized cartilage layer, between tesserae and perichondrium, distinguished from the cartilage core in containing Coll I and X (a common marker for mammalian mineralization), in addition to Coll II. Chondrocytes within tesserae appear intact and sit in lacunae filled with Coll II-based matrix, suggesting tesserae originate in cartilage, despite comprising a diversity of collagens. Intertesseral joints are also complex in their collagenous composition, being similar to supratesseral cartilage closer to the perichondrium, but containing unidentified fibrils nearer the cartilage core. Our results indicate a unique potential for tessellated cartilage in skeletal biology research, since it lacks features believed diagnostic for vertebrate cartilage mineralization (e.g. hypertrophic and apoptotic chondrocytes), while offering morphologies amenable for investigating the regulation of complex mineralized ultrastructure and tissues patterned on multiple collagens.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

For its pathogenicity, the inositol polyphosphate biosynthetic pathway plays critical roles. Recently, Ipk1 from C. neoformans (CnIpk1) was identified as an inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of IP5 to form IP6, a substrate for subsequent reaction to produce inositol pyrophosphates, such as PP-IP5/IP7. Furthermore, it was shown that deletion of IPK1 significantly reduces the virulence of C. neoformans, indicating that Ipk1 is a major virulence contributor. In this study, we determined a crystal structure of the apo-form of CnIpk1 at 2.35Å resolution, the first structure for a fungal Ipk1, using a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Even with a low sequence similarity of 26-28%, its overall structure resembles two other Ipk1 orthologs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtIpk1) and Mus musculus (MmIpk1), and the most crucial residues in the active site are conserved. Unlike AtIpk1 and MmIpk1, however, metal-binding sites for structural stabilization and conformational variations are absent in CnIpk1. The binding environments for substrate IP5 could be inferred by the two different binding sites for sulfate ion in CnIpk1.

Depending on the staining and preparative procedures employed, IF observed in transverse section in the transmission electron microscope have varied in appearance between that of a ""ring"" and a ""ring-core"" structure, corresponding to the so-called (8+0) and (7+1) protofilament arrangements. In a new analysis of the fine structure of the 1nm equatorial region of the X-ray diffraction pattern of quill we show that the observed pattern is consistent with the (8+0) model and we are also able to assign values to the various parameters. In contrast, we show that the observed X-ray pattern is inconsistent with a (7+1) arrangement. Furthermore, in the (7+1) model steric hindrance would be encountered between the core protofilament and those constituting the ring. The appearance of a central ""core"" in transverse TEM sections, previously attributed to a central protofilament, is explained in terms of portions of the apolar, disulfide-bonded head and/or tail domains of the trichocyte keratin IF molecules, including the conserved H subdomains, lying along the axis of the IF, thereby decreasing the efficacy of the reducing agents used prior to staining. The H1 subdomain, previously shown to be important in the assembly of epidermal IF molecules at the two- to four-molecule level, is likely to have a similar role for the trichocyte keratins and may form part of a central scaffold on which the molecules assemble into fully functional IF.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The understanding of the mechanisms ruling protein-protein interactions opens the door to manipulate protein assemblies in a rational way. Proteins are versatile scaffolds with great potential as tools in nanotechnology and biomedicine because of their chemical, structural, and functional versatility. Currently, bottom-up self-assembly based on biomolecular interactions of small and well-defined components, is an attractive approach to biomolecular engineering and biomaterial design. Specifically, repeat proteins are simplified systems for this purpose. In this work, we provide an overview of fundamental concepts of the design of new protein interfaces. We describe an experimental approach to form higher order architectures by a bottom-up assembly of repeated building blocks. For this purpose, we use designed consensus tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (CTPRs). CTPR arrays contain multiple identical repeats that interact through a single inter-repeat interface to form elongated superhelices. Introducing a novel interface along the CTPR superhelix allows two CTPR molecules to assemble into protein nanotubes. We apply three approaches to form protein nanotubes: electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and π-π interactions. We isolate and characterize the stability and shape of the formed dimers and analyze the nanotube formation considering the energy of the interaction and the structure in the three different models.

When trying to clone the highly repetitive genes for structural and functional studies, we experienced problems in obtaining PCR products. PCR failures and the highly repetitive nature of inverse autotransporters prompted us to sequence the genome of Y. ruckeri NVH_3758 using PacBio sequencing, which produces some of the longest average read lengths available in the industry at this moment. According to our sequencing data, YrIlm is composed of 2603 amino acids (7812bp) and has a molecular mass of 256.4kDa. Based on the new genome information, we performed PCR analysis on four non-sequenced Y. ruckeri strains as well as the sequenced. Y. ruckeri type strain.

The internal repeats of the yrInv gene product are highly diverged, but represent the same bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains as in yrIlm.

Here we have used continuous wave (CW) and Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) pulsed EPR spectroscopy to measure distances between TnI and TnC to track the movement of the functionally important regulatory 'switch' region of cardiac Tn. Spin labels were placed on the switch region of Troponin I and distances measured to Troponin C. Under conditions of high Ca2+, the interspin distances for one set (TnI151/TnC84) were 'short' (9-10Å) with narrow distance distribution widths (3-8Å) indicating the close interaction of the switch region with the N-lobe of TnC. Additional spin populations representative of longer interspin distances were detected by DEER. These longer distance populations, which were ∼16-19Å longer than the short distance populations, possessed notably broader distance distribution widths (14-29Å). Upon Ca2+ removal, the interspin population shifted toward the longer distances, indicating the release of the switch region from TnC and an overall increase in disorder for this region. Together, our results suggest that under conditions of low Ca2+, the close proximity of the TnI switch region to TnC in the cardiac isoform is necessary for promoting the interaction between the regulatory switch helix with the N-lobe of cardiac Troponin C, which, unlike the skeletal isoform, is largely in a closed conformation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To this end, we determined a large set (n=27) of dArmRP X-ray structures, of which 12 were previously unpublished, to calculate curvature parameters that define their geometry. Our analysis shows that consensus dArmRPs exhibit curvatures close to the optimal range for modular peptide recognition. Binding of peptide ligands can induce a curvature within the desired range, as confirmed by single-molecule FRET experiments in solution. On the other hand, computationally designed ArmRPs, where side chains have been chosen with the intention to optimally fit into a geometrically optimized backbone, turned out to be more divergent in reality, and thus not suitable for continuous peptide binding. Furthermore, we show that the formation of a crystal lattice can induce small but significant deviations from the curvature adopted in solution, which can interfere with the evaluation of repeat protein scaffolds when high accuracy is required.

Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of PI4KB is not directly modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. However, 14-3-3 proteins protect PI4KB from proteolytic degradation in vitro. Our structural analysis revealed that the PI4KB:14-3-3 protein complex is flexible but mostly within the disordered regions connecting the 14-3-3 binding site of the PI4KB with the rest of the PI4KB enzyme. It also predicted no direct modulation of PI4KB enzymatic activity by 14-3-3 proteins and that 14-3-3 binding will not interfere with PI4KB recruitment to the membrane by the ACBD3 protein. In addition, the structural analysis explains the observed protection from degradation; it revealed that several disordered regions of PI4KB become protected from proteolytical degradation upon 14-3-3 binding.

Further, the predicted tail fibers of ΦM5 are quite different from those of enteric bacteria phages, but have domains in common with other rhizophages. Genomically, ΦM5 is highly mosaic. The ΦM5 genome is 44,005bp with 357bp direct terminal repeats (DTRs) and 58 unique ORFs. Surprisingly, the capsid structural module, the tail module, the DNA-packaging terminase, the DNA replication module and the integrase each appear to be from a different lineage. One of the most unusual features of ΦM5 is its terminase whose large subunit is quite different from previously-described short-DTR-generating packaging machines and does not fit into any of the established phylogenetic groups.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Room temperature and cryo-cooled rhombohedral insulin crystals were equilibrated with 1.2M trehalose to study the effect of lowered water activity. The native and trehalose soaked crystals were isomorphous and had similar structures. Including all the low resolution data, the amplitudes of the structure factors were put on an absolute scale (in units of electrons per asymmetric unit) by constraining the integrated number of electrons inside the envelope of the calculated protein density map to equal the number deduced from the atomic model. This procedure defines the value of F(000), the amplitude at the origin of the Fourier transform, which is equal to the total number of electrons in the asymmetric unit (i.e. protein plus solvent). Comparison of the F(000) values for three isomorphous pairs of room temperature insulin crystals, three with trehalose and three without trehalose, indicates that 75±12 electrons per asymmetric unit were added to the crystal solvent when soaked in 1.2M trehalose. If all the water in the crystal were available as solvent for the trehalose, 304 electrons would have been added. Thus, the co-solvent accessible volume is one quarter of the total water in the crystal. Determination of the total number of electrons in a protein crystal is an essential first step for mapping the average density distribution of the disordered solvent.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Fibrillar collagen in atherosclerotic plaques and their directionality are anticipated to play a crucial role in plaque rupture. This study aimed assessing 3D fiber orientations and architecture in atherosclerotic plaques for the first time. Seven carotid plaques were imaged ex-vivo with a state-of-the-art Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) technique, using a high magnetic field (9.4Tesla) MRI scanner. A 3D spin-echo sequence with uni-polar diffusion sensitizing pulsed field gradients was utilized for DTI and fiber directions were assessed from diffusion tensor measurements. The distribution of the 3D fiber orientations in atherosclerotic plaques were quantified and the principal fiber orientations (circumferential, longitudinal or radial) were determined. Overall, 52% of the fiber orientations in the carotid plaque specimens were closest to the circumferential direction, 34% to the longitudinal direction, and 14% to the radial direction. Statistically no significant difference was measured in the amount of the fiber orientations between the concentric and eccentric plaque sites. However, concentric plaque sites showed a distinct structural organization, where the principally longitudinally oriented fibers were closer to the luminal side and the principally circumferentially oriented fibers were located more abluminally. The acquired unique information on 3D plaque fiber direction will help understanding pathobiological mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque progression and pave the road to more realistic biomechanical plaque modeling for rupture assessment.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To further simplify the production and crystallization experiments we have explored the production of chimeric proteins corresponding to covalent association between the targets and their specific binders strengthened by a linker. Although chimeric proteins with expression partners are classically used to enhance expression, these fusions cannot usually be used for crystallization. With specific expression partners like a cognate αRep this is no longer true, and chimeric proteins can be expressed purified and crystallized. αRep selection by phage display suppose that at least a small amount of the target protein should be produced to be used as a bait for selection and this might, in some cases, be difficult. We have therefore transferred the αRep library in a new construction adapted to selection by protein complementation assay (PCA). This new procedure allows to select specific binders by direct interaction with the target in the cytoplasm of the bacteria and consequently does not require preliminary purification of target protein. αRep binders selected by PCA or by phage display can be used to enhance expression, stability, solubility and crystallogenesis of proteins that are otherwise difficult to express, purify and/or crystallize.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Important functions attributed to the osteocyte network include the control of bone remodeling and a contribution to mineral homeostasis. To detect structural clues of the formation and functionality of the network, this study analyzes the structure and orientation of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN), specifically in relation to the concentric bone lamellae within human osteons. The network structure within 49 osteons from four samples of cortical bone from the femoral midshaft of middle-aged healthy women was determined by a combination of rhodamine staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy followed by computational image analysis. A quantitative evaluation showed that 64±1% of the canalicular length has an angle smaller than 30° to the direction towards the osteon center, while the lateral network - defined by an orientation angle larger than 60° - comprises 16±1%. With the same spatial periodicity as the bone lamellae, both radial and lateral network show variations in the network density and order. However, only the preferred orientation of the lateral network twists when crossing a lamella. This twist agrees with the preferred orientation of the fibrous collagen matrix. The chirality of the twist was found to be individual-specific. The coalignment between network and matrix extends to the orientation of the elongated osteocyte lacunae. The intimate link between OLCN and collagen matrix implies an interplay between osteocyte processes and the arrangement of the surrounding collagen fibers during osteoid formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The ligament contains fibrous structures consisting of aragonite crystals surrounded by a dense organic matrix. This organic matrix may contribute to the formation of fibrous aragonite crystals, but the mechanism underlying this formation remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel ligament-specific protein, Pinctada fucata tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (PfTIMP), from the fibrous organic matrix between aragonite crystals in the ligament using the amino acid sequence and cDNA cloning methods. PfTIMP consists of 143 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 13,580.4. To investigate the activity of PfTIMP, inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was measured. PfTIMP strongly inhibited human MMP13 and MMP9. Eight MMP homologs were identified from a P. fucata genomic database by BLAST search. To identify the specific MMP that may contribute to ligament formation, the expression level of each MMP was measured in the mantle isthmus, which secretes the ligament. The expression of MMP54089 increased after scratching of the ligament, while the expressions of other MMPs did not increase after doing the same operation. To identify the role of MMP54089 in forming the ligament structure, double stranded (ds) RNA targeting MMP54089 was injected into living P. fucata to suppress the function of MMP54089. Scanning electron microscopic images showed disordered growing surfaces of the ligament in individuals injected with MMP54089-specific dsRNA. These results suggest that PfTIMP and MMP54089 play important roles in the formation of the fibrous ligament structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Tissue fixation is often required for preservation or sectioning of the tissue. This may affect collagen nanostructure and potentially provide incorrect information when analyzed after fixation. We aimed to unravel the effect of 1) ethanol and formalin fixation and 2) 24h air-dehydration on the organization and structure of collagen fibers at the nano-scale using small and wide angle X-ray scattering. Samples were divided into 4 groups: ethanol fixed, formalin fixed, and two untreated sample groups. Samples were allowed to air-dehydrate in handmade Kapton pockets during the measurements (24h) except for one untreated group. Ethanol fixation affected the collagen organization and nanostructure substantially and during 24h of dehydration dramatic changes were evident. Formalin fixation had minor effects on the collagen organization but after 12h of air-dehydration the spatial variation increased substantially, not evident in the untreated samples. Generally, collagen shrinkage and loss of alignment was evident in all samples during 24h of dehydration but the changes were subtle in all groups except the ethanol fixed samples. This study shows that tissue fixation needs to be chosen carefully in order to preserve the features of interest in the tissue.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Cryo-electron tomograms are reconstructed from projection images taken at defined tilt-angles. In order to recover high-resolution information from cryo-electron tomograms, it is necessary to measure and correct for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope. Most commonly, this is performed using protocols that approximate the sample as a two-dimensional (2D) plane. This approximation accounts for differences in defocus and therefore CTF across the tilted sample. It does not account for differences in defocus of objects at different heights within the sample; instead, a 3D approach is required. Currently available approaches for 3D-CTF correction are computationally expensive and have not been widely implemented. Here we simulate the benefits of 3D-CTF correction for high-resolution subtomogram averaging, and present a user-friendly, computationally-efficient 3D-CTF correction tool, NovaCTF, that is compatible with standard tomogram reconstruction workflows in IMOD. We validate the approach on synthetic data and test it using subtomogram averaging of real data. Consistent with our simulations, we find that 3D-CTF correction allows high-resolution structures to be obtained with much smaller subtomogram averaging datasets than are required using 2D-CTF. We also show that using equivalent dataset sizes, 3D-CTF correction can be used to obtain higher-resolution structures.

This problem has been resolved in part through the use of globular assembly domains that improve protein folding and prevent aggregation. The primary consideration now in designing coiled-coil fusion constructs for myosin is deciding where to truncate the coiled-coil and which amino acid residues to include from the folding domain. This is especially important for myosin that contains numerous regions of low predicted coiled-coil propensity. Here we describe the strategy adopted to determine the structure of the region that extends from Arg1677 - Leu1797 that included two areas that do not show a strong sequence signature of a conventional left-handed coiled coil or canonical heptad repeat. This demonstrates again that, with careful choice of fusion constructs, overlapping structures exhibit very similar conformations for the myosin rod fragments in the canonical regions. However, conformational variability is seen around Leu1706 which is a hot spot for cardiomyopathy mutations suggesting that this might be important for function.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The lack of a structure for the channel open state has greatly hampered the understanding of the normal gating process and mechanisms of disease-associated mutations. Here we report the structural modeling for the open state of an NMDA receptor. Staring from the crystal structure of the closed state, we repacked the pore-lining helices to generate an initial open model. This model was modified to ensure tight packing between subunits and then refined by a molecular dynamics simulation in explicit membrane. We identify Cα-H…O hydrogen bonds, between the Cα of a conserved glycine in one transmembrane helix and a carbonyl oxygen of a membrane-parallel helix, at the extracellular side of the transmembrane domain as important for stabilizing the open state.

X-ray diffraction data were collected from oriented calf-thymus DNA fibers in the relative humidity range of 98%-70%, during which DNA undergoes the B- to A-form transition. Coexistence of both forms was observed over a finite humidity range at the transition. The change in DNA separation in response to variation in humidity, i.e. change of chemical potential, led to the derivation of a force-distance curve with a characteristic exponential decay constant of∼2Å for both A- and B-DNA. While previous osmotic stress measurements had yielded similar force-decay constants, they were limited to B-DNA with a surface separation (wall-to-wall distance) typically>5Å. The current investigation confirms that the hydration force remains dominant even in the dry A-DNA state and at surface separation down to∼1.5Å, within the first hydration shell. It is shown that the observed chemical potential difference between the A and B states could be attributed to the water layer inside the major and minor grooves of the A-DNA double helices, which can partially interpenetrate each other in the tightly packed A phase. The humidity-controlled X-ray diffraction method described here can be employed to perform direct force measurements on a broad range of biological structures such as membranes and filamentous protein networks.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Exploration of an additional role of Mycobacterium smegmatis MutT1.,"Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnA, n=2-6), particularly Ap4A, are involved in several important physiological processes. The substantial sequence identity of the Nudix hydrolase domain (domain 1) of Mycobacterium smegmatis MutT1 (MsMutT1) with a known Ap4A hydrolase suggested that MsMutT1 could also hydrolyse diadenosine polyphosphates. Biochemical experiments yielded results in conformity with this suggestion, with Ap4A as the best among the substrates. ATP is a product in all experiments; small amounts of ADP were also observed in the experiments involving Ap4A and Ap6A. Hydrolysis was inhibited by fluoride ions in all cases. The mechanism of action and its inhibition in relation to ApnA were explored through the X-ray analysis of the crystals of the MsMutT1 complexes with Ap5A; Ap5A and MnCl2; Ap4A; ATP; and ATP.NaF.MgCl2. The aggregation pattern of molecules in the first four crystals is similar to that found in a majority of MsMutT1-NTP crystals. Substrate molecules occupy the primary binding site and ATP occupies a site at an intermolecular interface, in the first two. ATP occupies both the sites in the third and fourth crystal. The protein-ligand interactions observed in these crystal structures lead to an explanation of the molecular mechanism of hydrolysis of ApnA by MsMutT1. The fifth crystal exhibits a new packing arrangement. The structure of the complex provides an explanation for the fluoride inhibition of the activity of the enzyme. It would thus appear that MutT1 has a major role involving the hydrolysis of diadenosine polyphosphates, which could be elucidated at the molecular level.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Linear polarization-in, polarization-out (PIPO) second harmonic generation (SHG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was utilized to assess the impact of metastatic involvement on collagen fibril organization. Increased observations of deviations in the typical plywood motif or a parallel packing structure and an increased average measured susceptibility ratio (related to relative degree of in-plane vs. out-plane fibrils in the analyzed tissue area) in bone adjacent to metastatic involvement was indicative of change in fibrilar organization compared to healthy controls. In particular, collagen-I fibrils in tumour-induced osteoblastic bone growth showed no adherence to the plywood motif or parallel packing structure seen in healthy lamellar bone, exhibiting a much higher susceptibility ratio and degree of fibril disorder.

To overcome these challenges, we built a structural model of the PVX particle based on the available structures from pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a close cousin of PVX. Using the model and a series of chemical conjugation experiments, we identified and probed the addressability of cysteine side chains. Chemical reactivity of cysteines was confirmed using Michael-addition and thiol-selective probes, including fluorescent dyes and biotin tags.

SAA complexes with palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphocholine (POPC) were analyzed for structure and stability using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The results revealed the formation of 8-11nm lipoproteins that were∼50% α-helical and stable at near-physiological conditions but were irreversibly remodeled at Tm∼52°C. Similar HDL-size nanoparticles formed spontaneously at ambient conditions or upon thermal remodeling of parent lipoproteins containing various amounts of proteins and lipids, including POPC and cholesterol. Therefore, such HDL-size particles formed stable kinetically accessible structures in a wide range of conditions.

High stability of these nanoparticles and their HDL-like size suggest that similar lipoproteins may form in vivo during inflammation or injury when SAA concentration is high and membranes from dead cells require rapid removal.

The underlying mechanisms of IAPP aggregation have not yet been clearly defined, although the highly amyloidogenic sequence of the protein has been extensively studied. Several segments have been highlighted as aggregation-prone regions (APRs), with much attention focused on the central 8-17 and 20-29 stretches. In this work, we employ micro-Raman spectroscopy to identify specific regions that are contributing to or are excluded from the amyloidogenic core of IAPP amyloid fibrils. Our results demonstrate that both the N-terminal region containing a conserved disulfide bond between Cys residues at positions 2 and 7, and the C-terminal region containing the only Tyr residue are excluded from the amyloid core. Finally, by performing detailed aggregation assays and molecular dynamics simulations on a number of IAPP variants, we demonstrate that point mutations within the central APRs contribute to the reduction of the overall amyloidogenic potential of the protein but do not completely abolish the formation of IAPP amyloid fibrils.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we combine these approaches to deliver super-accurate correlation of fluorescent proteins to cellular structures. We show that YFP and GFP have enhanced blinking properties when embedded in acrylic resin and imaged under partial vacuum, enabling in vacuo single molecule localisation microscopy. In conventional section-based correlative microscopy experiments, the specimen must be moved between imaging systems and/or further manipulated for optimal viewing. These steps can introduce undesirable alterations in the specimen, and complicate correlation between imaging modalities. We avoided these issues by using a scanning electron microscope with integrated optical microscope to acquire both localisation and electron microscopy images, which could then be precisely correlated. Collecting data from ultrathin sections also improved the axial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the raw localisation microscopy data. Expanding data collection across an array of sections will allow 3-dimensional correlation over unprecedented volumes.

A homodimeric stoichiometry of the TMEM16 family of proteins has been reported but an important question is whether the protein resides always in a dimeric configuration in the plasma membrane or whether monomers of the protein are also present in its native state within in the intact plasma membrane. We have determined the stoichiometry of the human (h)TMEM16A within whole COS-7 cells in liquid. For the purpose of detecting TMEM16A subunits, single proteins were tagged by the streptavidin-binding peptide within extracellular loops accessible by streptavidin coated quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles. The labeled proteins were then imaged using correlative light microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) detection. The locations of 19,583 individual proteins were determined of which a statistical analysis using the pair correlation function revealed the presence of a dimeric conformation of the protein. The amounts of detected label pairs and single labels were compared between experiments in which the TMEM16A SBP-tag position was varied, and experiments in which tagged and non-tagged TMEM16A proteins were present.

In the last decade the antibody fragment indicated as nanobody (VHH or single domain antibody) has found its way to different applications previously done with conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can be selected to bind with high affinity and specificity to different antigens. They are small (molecular weight ca. 15kDa) and are usually easy to produce in microorganisms. Here we have evaluated the feasibility of a nanobody binding to HER2 for application in immuno-electron microscopy. To obtain highest labeling efficiency combined with optimal specificity, different labeling conditions were analysed, which included nanobody concentration, fixation and blocking conditions. The obtained optimal protocol was applied for post-embedment labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections and for pre-embedment labeling of HER2 for fluorescence microscopy and both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We show that formaldehyde fixation after incubation with the anti-HER2 nanobody, improves labeling intensity. Among all tested blocking agents the best results were obtained with a mixture of cold water fish gelatine and acetylated bovine serum albumin, which prevented a-specific interactions causing background labeling while preserving specific interactions at the same time.

This creates a demand for better methods to analyse the data, including improved scores for comparison, classification and integration of data at different resolutions. To this end, we developed and evaluated a set of scoring functions that compare 3D-EM volumes. To test our scores we used a benchmark set of volume alignments derived from the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We find that the performance of different scores vary with the map-type, resolution and the extent of overlap between volumes. Importantly, adding the overlap information to the local scoring functions can significantly improve their precision and accuracy in a range of resolutions. A combined score involving the local mutual information and overlap (LMI_OV) performs best overall, irrespective of the map category, resolution or the extent of overlap, and we recommend this score for general use. The local mutual information score itself is found to be more discriminatory than cross-correlation coefficient for intermediate-to-low resolution maps or when the map size and density distribution differ significantly. For comparing map surfaces, we implemented two filters to detect the surface points, including one based on the ‘extent of surface exposure’. We show that scores that compare surfaces are useful at low resolutions and for maps with evident surface features.

Besides several soluble subunits, the glucose-specific PTS includes the integral membrane protein IICB that couples the transmembrane transport of glucose to its phosphorylation. Here, we used electron crystallography of sugar-embedded tubular crystals of the glucose-specific IIC transport domain from Escherichia coli (ecIICglc) to visualize the structure of the transporter in the presence and absence of its substrate. Using an in vivo transport assay and binding competition experiments, we first established that, while it transports d-glucose, ecIICglc does not bind l-glucose. We then determined the projection structure of ecIICglc from tubular crystals embedded in d- and l-glucose and found a subtle conformational change. From comparison of the ecIICglc projection maps with crystal structures of other IIC transporters, we can deduce that the transporter adopts an inward-facing conformation, and that the maps in the presence and absence of the substrate reflect the transporter before and after release of the transported glucose into the cytoplasm.

We demonstrate this approach with computationally generated scattering intensities and then apply it to scattering data from Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and in vitro assembled fibrils of Aβ40 peptides. Refining the cross-sectional shape of TMV from SAXS data collected on a 26mg/ml solution resulted in a circular shape with outer diameter of ∼180Å and inner diameter of ∼40Å consistent with the known structure of TMV. We also utilized this method to analyze the equatorial scattering from TMV collected by Don Caspar from a concentrated (24% ∼295mg/ml) gel of TMV as reported in his Ph.D. thesis in 1955. This data differs from the SAXS data in having a sharp interference peak at ∼250Å spacing, indicative of strong interparticle interactions in the gel. Analysis of this data required consideration of interatomic vectors as long as 2000Å and resulted in generation of images that were interpreted as representative of local organization of TMV particles in the sample. Peaks in the images were separated, on average by about 250Å with a density consistent with Caspar's original measurements. Analysis of SAXS data from Aβ fibrils resulted in a cross-sectional shape that could be interpreted in terms of structural models that have been constructed from ssNMR and cryoEM.

Crystal structures of arginine kinase in an open, substrate-free form and closed, transition state analog (TSA) complex indicate that the enzyme undergoes substantial domain and loop rearrangements required for substrate binding, catalysis, and product release. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has shown that substrate-free arginine kinase is rigid on the ps-ns timescale (average S2=0.84±0.08) yet quite dynamic on the µs-ms timescale (35 residues with Rex, 12%), and that movements of the N-terminal domain and the loop comprising residues I182-G209 are rate-limiting on catalysis. Here, NMR of the TSA-bound enzyme shows similar rigidity on the ps-ns timescale (average S2=0.91±0.05) and substantially increased μs-ms timescale dynamics (77 residues; 22%). Many of the residues displaying μs-ms dynamics in NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) 15N backbone relaxation dispersion experiments of the TSA complex are also dynamic in substrate-free enzyme. However, the presence of additional dynamic residues in the TSA-bound form suggests that dynamics extend through much of the C-terminal domain, which indicates that in the closed form, a larger fraction of the protein takes part in conformational transitions to the excited state(s). Conformational exchange rate constants (kex) of the TSA complex are all approximately 2500s-1, higher than any observed in the substrate-free enzyme (800-1900s-1).

The origin of these domain prototypes, however, remains poorly understood. One hypothesis posits that they arose from an ancestral set of peptides, which acted as cofactors of RNA-mediated catalysis and replication. Initially, these peptides were entirely dependent on the RNA scaffold for their structure, but as their complexity increased, they became able to form structures by excluding water through hydrophobic contacts, making them independent of the RNA scaffold. Their ability to fold was thus an emergent property of peptide-RNA coevolution. The ribosome is the main survivor of this primordial RNA world and offers an excellent model system for retracing the steps that led to the folded proteins of today, due to its very slow rate of change. Close to the peptidyl transferase center, which is the oldest part of the ribosome, proteins are extended and largely devoid of secondary structure; further from the center, their secondary structure content increases and supersecondary topologies become common, although the proteins still largely lack a hydrophobic core; at the ribosomal periphery, supersecondary structures coalesce around hydrophobic cores, forming folds that resemble those seen in proteins of the cytosol.

The organism produces two homologous toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which enter and disrupt host cell function by glucosylating and thereby inactivating key signalling molecules within the host. As a toxin-mediated disease, there has been a significant interest in identifying small molecule inhibitors of the toxins' glucosyltransferase activities. This study was initiated as part of an effort to identify the mode of inhibition for a small molecule inhibitor of glucosyltransferase activity called apigenin. In the course of trying to get co-crystals with this inhibitor, we determined five different structures of the TcdA and TcdB glucosyltransferase domains and made use of a non-hydrolyzable UDP-glucose substrate. While we were able to visualize apigenin bound in one of our structures, the site was a crystal packing interface and not likely to explain the mode of inhibition. Nevertheless, the structure allowed us to capture an apo-state (one without the sugar nucleotide substrate) of the TcdB glycosyltransferase domain that had not been previously observed. Comparison of this structure with structures obtained in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable UDP-glucose analogue have allowed us to document multiple conformations of a C-terminal loop important for catalysis.

Although the surface activity of a mixture of chaplin peptides has observed to depend on pH, it is unclear how the solvent environment (i.e. pH) influences the structure, assembly and subsequent functionality of these individual peptides. In this study, the conformation and fibril forming propensity of the Chaplin E peptide was assessed as a function of pH using a combination of experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. At an acidic pH of 3.0, Chaplin E retained a random coil structure, whereas at the isoelectric point of 6.7 or a basic pH of 10.0, Chaplin E rapidly formed amyloid fibrils rich in β-sheet structure with high efficiency (>93%). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate the persistence of greater α-helical content at the N-terminus at high pH; this is likely partly due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between residues His6 and Lys10. Since fibril formation was observed at high but not at low pH, we propose that the presence of an N-terminal α-helix in the monomeric form of Chaplin E is required for aggregation and conversion to β-amyloid fibrils. The pH sensitivity of Chaplin E peptide structure provides a route to control peptide assembly and may be important for the physiological function of this peptide, as a surface active agent in the transition from vegetative to aerial growth and could assist Streptomyces coelicolor in response to environmental fluctuations in pH.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The molecular mechanism behind the development of such structural organizations is poorly known, although it is generally held that organic matrix proteins play an essential role. While most crustacean cuticular organizations exhibit horizontal chitinous layering, a typical vertical organization is found towards the surface of the teeth in the mandibles of the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Candidate genes encoding for mandible-forming structural proteins were mined in C. quadricarinatus molt-related transcriptomic libraries by using a binary patterning approach. A new protein family, termed the Mandible Alanine Rich Structural (MARS) protein family, with a modular sequence design predicted to form fibers, was found. Investigations of spatial and temporal expression of the different MARS genes suggested specific expression in the mandibular teeth-forming epithelium, particularly during the formation of the chitinous vertical organization. MARS loss-of-function RNAi experiments resulted in the collapse of the organization of the chitin fibers oriented vertically to the surface of the crayfish mandibular incisor tooth. A general search of transcriptomic libraries suggested conservation of MARS proteins across a wide array of crustaceans. Our results provide a first look into the molecular mechanism used to build the complex crustacean mandible and into the specialized vertical structural solution that has evolved in skeletal elements.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

CprB is implicated as a receptor of γ-butyrolactones, a class of quorum sensing molecules, responsible for initiating secondary metabolic pathways. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of DNA recognition, the X-ray structure of CprB in complex with its biological relevant operator sequence was solved to a resolution of 3.95Å. Furthermore, to refine and compliment the results, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the X-ray structure as the template. The studies reveal that CprB binds to DNA as dimer of dimers with this mode of interaction results in minimal distortion in the DNA, enabling these proteins to recognize multiple sequences with varying affinity. Another crucial finding from our simulation results was that the positively charged N-terminal arm of CprB brings extra stability to the protein-DNA complex by interacting with the minor-groove of the DNA and anchoring itself to the phosphate backbone. Corroborating electrophoretic mobility shift assay and fluorescence anisotropy experiments showed that the mutant ΔN6-CprB exhibited about 7-8 fold reduced DNA binding.

We use materials and biological tissue characterization techniques, including computed tomography, electron and light microscopy, X-ray and Raman spectroscopy and histology to characterize the morphology, ultrastructure and chemical composition of tesserae-associated EPMs in different elasmobranch species. EPMs appear to develop between and in intimate association with tesserae, but lack the lines of periodic growth and varying mineral density characteristic of tesserae.

PeakForce QNM analysis provided better resolution in terms of pixel number compared to FV mode and reduced acquisition time, thus limiting the consequences of spontaneous living adult CM dedifferentiation once isolated from the cardiac tissue. PeakForce QNM mode on fixed CMs clearly visualized subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and their loss following formamide treatment, concomitant with the interfibrillar mitochondria climbing up and forming heaps at the cell surface.

High PeakForce QNM resolution led to better contrasted mechanical maps than FV mode and provided correlation between adhesion, dissipation, mechanical and topographical maps. Modified hydrophobic AFM tip enhanced contrast on adhesion and dissipation maps and suggested that CM surface crests and hollows exhibit distinct chemical properties.

The quality of the Thon rings is also a good predictor of the image-quality of particles, but only when images of the streptavidin crystals extend to relatively high resolution. When the estimated resolution of streptavidin was 5Å or worse, for example, the ribosomal density map obtained from 22,697 particles went to only 9.5Å, while the resolution of the map reached 4.0Å for the same number of particles, when the estimated resolution of streptavidin crystal was 4Å or better.

 Abstract
 
 Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) is becoming widely adopted as a tool for structural characterization of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. Vitrification of the sample to obtain a dense distribution of particles within a single field of view remains a major bottleneck for the success of such experiments. Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method to increase the density of frozen-hydrated particles on grids with holey carbon support films. It relies on performing multiple rounds of sample application and blotting prior to plunge freezing in liquid ethane. We show that this approach is generally applicable and significantly increases particle density for a range of samples, such as small protein complexes, viruses and filamentous assemblies. The method is versatile, easy to implement, minimizes sample requirements and can enable characterization of samples that would otherwise resist structural studies using single particle cryoEM.

Automatic segmentation of biological volumes is still a very challenging research field, and current methods usually require a large amount of manually-produced training data to deliver a high-quality segmentation. However, the complex appearance of cellular features and the high variance from one sample to another, along with the time-consuming work of manually labelling complete volumes, makes the required training data very scarce or non-existent. Thus, fully automatic approaches are often infeasible for many practical applications. With the aim of unifying the segmentation power of automatic approaches with the user expertise and ability to manually annotate biological samples, we present a new workbench named SuRVoS (Super-Region Volume Segmentation). Within this software, a volume to be segmented is first partitioned into hierarchical segmentation layers (named Super-Regions) and is then interactively segmented with the user's knowledge input in the form of training annotations. SuRVoS first learns from and then extends user inputs to the rest of the volume, while using Super-Regions for quicker and easier segmentation than when using a voxel grid.

It could also be a result of poor book keeping. Recently, we have developed a procedure called MarathonMR that has the power to resolve some of these problems automatically. In this communication, we describe how the MarathonMR was used to determine four different protein structures that had remained elusive for several years. We describe the plausible reasons for the difficulties encountered in determining these structures and point out that the method presented here could be a validation tool for protein structures deposited in the protein data bank.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The resulting density maps have been fitted with atomic models of actin, tropomyosin and troponin showing that: (i) the polarity of the troponin complex is consistent with our 2009 findings, with large shape changes in troponin between the two states; (ii) without Ca2+ the tropomyosin pseudo-repeats all lie at almost equivalent positions in the ‘blocked’ position on actin (over subdomains 1 and 2); (iii) in the active state the tropomyosin pseudo-repeats are all displaced towards subdomains 3 and 4 of actin, but the extent of displacement varies within the regulatory unit depending upon the axial location of the pseudo-repeats with respect to troponin. Individual pseudo-repeats with Ca2+ bound to troponin can be assigned either to the ‘closed’ state, a partly activated conformation, or the ‘M-state’, a fully activated conformation which has previously been thought to occur only when myosin heads bind. These results lead to a modified view of the steric blocking model of thin filament regulation in which cooperative activation is governed by troponin-mediated local interactions of the pseudo-repeats of tropomyosin with actin.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These dynamic and controllable protein assemblies, which are composed of dozens or hundreds of copies of an enzyme or related enzymes, have emerged as important players in myriad cellular processes. We are only beginning to appreciate the breadth of function of these types of macromolecular assemblies. These higher order structures, which can be assembled in response to varied cellular stimuli including changing metabolite concentrations or signaling cascades, give the cell the capacity to modulate levels of biomolecules both temporally and spatially. This provides an added level of control with distinct kinetics and unique features that can be harnessed as a subtle, yet powerful regulatory mechanism. Due, in large part, to advances in structural methods, such as crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, and the advent of super-resolution microscopy techniques, a rapidly increasing number of these higher order structures are being identified and characterized. In this review, we detail what is known about the structure, function and control mechanisms of these mesoscale protein assemblies, with a particular focus on those involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. These structures have important implications both for our understanding of fundamental cellular processes and as fertile ground for new targets for drug discovery and development.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Sinkovits and Baker (2010) gave a classification of all possible ways of building an icosahedral structure solely from trisymmetrons and pentasymmetrons, which requires the triangulation number T to be odd.

Here, we report on X-ray analyses of human apo- and holo-CRBP1, showing nearly identical structures, at variance with the results of a recent study on the same proteins containing a His-Tag, which appears to be responsible for a destabilizing effect on the apoprotein. The analysis of crystallographic B-factors for our structures indicates that the putative portal region, in particular α-helix-II, along with Arg58 and the E-F loop, is the most flexible part of both apo- and holoprotein, consistent with its role in ligand uptake and release. Fluorometric titrations of wild type and mutant forms of apo-CRBP1, coupled with X-ray analyses, provided insight into structural and molecular determinants for the interaction of retinol with CRBP1. An approximately stoichiometric binding of retinol to wild type apo-CRBP1 (Kd∼4.5nM), significantly lower binding affinity for both mutants Q108L (Kd∼65nM) and K40L (Kd∼70nM) and very low binding affinity for the double mutant Q108L/K40L (Kd∼250nM) were determined, respectively. Overall, our data indicate that the extensive apolar interactions between the ligand and hydrophobic residues lining the retinol binding cavity are sufficient to keep it in its position bound to CRBP1. However, polar interactions of the retinol hydroxyl end group with Gln108 and Lys40 play a key role to induce a high binding affinity and specificity for the interaction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

High frames rates enabled dose fractionation, where a long exposure is broken into a movie, permitting specimen drift to be registered and corrected. The typical approach for image registration, with high shot noise and low contrast, is multi-reference (MR) cross-correlation. Here we present the software package Zorro, which provides robust drift correction for dose fractionation by use of an intensity-normalized cross-correlation and logistic noise model to weight each cross-correlation in the MR model and filter each cross-correlation optimally. Frames are reliably registered by Zorro with low dose and defocus. Methods to evaluate performance are presented, by use of independently-evaluated even- and odd-frame stacks by trajectory comparison and Fourier ring correlation.

It is made up of lamellae of aragonite tablets bonded together by the organic interlamellar membranes (ILMs), of which the latter occupy less than 5wt% of nacre. For a long time, previous authors failed to directly observe the crystallographic relationship between the ILM and aragonite tablet in bivalve shells. Here, using high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), we investigate the interfacial structure of the domed tablets that coexist with the flat ones in green mussels.

Deformation of biomolecules comes from three sources: sample instability, adsorption to the imaging substrate, and crushing under tip pressure. To disentangle these causes, we measured the maximum height of a well-known biomolecule, the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), under eight different experimental conditions positing that the maximum height value is a specific indicator of sample deformations. Six basic AFM experimental factors were tested: imaging in air (AIR) versus in liquid (LIQ), imaging with flat minerals (MICA) versus flat organic surfaces (self-assembled monolayers, SAM), and imaging forces with oscillating tapping mode (TAP) versus PeakForce tapping (PFT). The results show that the most critical parameter in accurately measuring the height of TMV in air is the substrate. In a liquid environment, regardless of the substrate, the most critical parameter is the imaging mode. Most importantly, the expected TMV height values were obtained with both imaging with the PeakForce tapping mode either in liquid or in air at the condition of using self-assembled monolayers as substrate. This study unambiguously explains previous poor results of imaging biomolecules on mica in air and suggests alternative methodologies for depositing soft biomolecules on well organized self-assembled monolayers.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, mouse fibroblasts without functional Arp2/3 complex migrate at rates similar to wild-type cells, contradicting this paradigm. We show by correlative fluorescence and large-scale cryo-tomography studies combined with automated actin-network analysis that the absence of functional Arp2/3 complex has profound effects on the nano-scale architecture of actin networks.

RNPs package distinct viral genomic RNA segments of different lengths into pleomorphic influenza virions. RNPs also function in viral RNA transcription and replication. Different RNP segments have varying lengths, but all must be incorporated into virions during assembly and then released during viral entry for productive infection cycles. RNP structures serve varied functions in the viral replication cycle, therefore understanding their molecular organization and flexibility is essential to understanding these functions. Here, we show using electron tomography and image analyses that isolated RNP filaments are not rigid helical structures, but instead display variations in lengths, curvatures, and even tolerated kinks and local unwinding. Additionally, we observed NP rings within RNP preparations, which were commonly composed of 5, 6, or 7 NP molecules and were of similar widths to filaments, suggesting plasticity in NP-NP interactions mediate RNP structural polymorphism. To demonstrate that NP alone could generate rings of variable oligomeric state, we performed 2D single particle image analysis on recombinant NP and found that rings of 4 and 5 protomers dominated, but rings of all compositions up to 7 were directly observed with variable frequency.

Functional or conformational effects due to the elongated C-terminal tail in the long splice variants have not been investigated nor has the conformation of the C-terminal tail been analyzed. Here, we analyzed the conformation of the elongated C-terminal tail and investigated conformational differences between long and short splice variants of JNKs using JNK3α2 and JNK3α1 as models. We adopted hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to analyze the conformation. HDX-MS revealed that the C-terminal tail is mostly intrinsically disordered, and that the conformation of the kinase domain of JNK3α2 is more dynamic than that of JNK3α1.

Osteocytes, which organize a dense network that is closely linked with the circumambient matrix, play a key role in regulation of bone microstructure and material properties. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of cancer metastasis on the organization of the osteocyte network and collagen/biological apatite (BAp) microstructure in the context of osteocyte/matrix coupling. Using a mouse model intracardially injected with B16F10 melanoma cells or vehicle, the geometric and metabolic changes to osteocytes were analyzed by nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) and histology, and the alignment of collagen fibrils and BAp was analyzed by birefringence measurement and microbeam-X-ray diffraction, respectively. The material properties of bones were further analyzed with nanoindentation method. These experiments revealed that the osteocyte network was markedly disorganized in cancer-bearing bone tissues. The osteocytes showed a variety of residing states in the lacunae; some lacunae were osteolytic while some were replete with immature matrix, suggesting significant disruption in osteocyte/matrix coupling. Collagen/BAp microstructure was also disorganized in cancer-bearing bones as observed by significant decreases in the preferential alignment of both collagen fibrils and BAp; the latter was further shown to be significantly correlated with Young's modulus. The present study revealed that the disruption in the arrangement of the osteocyte network and collagen/BAp microstructure and the deterioration of mechanical function occurred synchronously during cancer bone metastasis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

PCC 6803 - Novel insights into structure and activity regulation.,"Proteases play a vital role in the removal of proteins, which become damaged due to temperature or oxidative stress. Important to this process in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is the family of Deg/HtrA proteases; HhoA (sll1679), HhoB (sll1427) and HtrA (slr1204). While previous studies have elucidated the structures of Deg/HtrA proteases from Escherichia coli and from the chloroplast of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, no structural data have been available for any Deg/HtrA protease from cyanobacteria, the evolutionary ancestor of the chloroplast. To gain a deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms and regulation of these proteins we have solved the structure of the Synechocystis HhoA protease in complex with a co-purified peptide by X-ray crystallography. HhoA assembles into stable trimers, mediated by its protease domain and further into a cage-like hexamer by a novel interaction between the PDZ domains of opposing trimers. Each PDZ domain contains two loops for PDZ-PDZ formation: interaction clamp one and two (IC1, IC2). IC1 interacts with IC2 on the opposing PDZ domain and vice versa. Our structure shows a peptide bound to a conserved groove on the PDZ domain and the properties of this pocket suggest that it binds substrate proteins as well as the neo C-termini of cleaved substrates. In agreement with previous studies showing the proteolytic activity of HhoA to be activated by Ca2+ or Mg2+, binding of divalent metal ions to the central channel of the trimer by the L1 activation loop was observed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Eight species: Acanthochitona zelandica, Notoplax violacea (Family Acanthochitonidae, Suborder Acanthochitonina, Order Chitonida), Chiton glaucus, Onithochiton neglectus, Sypharochiton spelliserpentis, Sypharochiton sinclairi (Family Chitonidae, Suborder, Chitonina, Order Chitonida), Ischnochiton maorianus (Family Ischnochitonidae, Suborder Chitonina, Order Chitonida), and Leptochiton inquinatus (Family Leptochitonidae, Suborder Lepidopleurina, Order Lepidopleurida) were collected from the Otago Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand. The valves of these chitons were analysed with X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectrometry, and Scanning Electron Micrography (SEM) to determine their mineralogy and microstructure. Both the XRD and Raman data show that the valves consisted solely of aragonite. The observed microstructures of the valves were complex, typically composed of four to seven sublayers, and varied among species. The dorsal layer, the tegmentum, of each species was granular and the ventral layer, the articulamentum, was predominately composed of a spherulitic sublayer, a crossed lamellar sublayer, and an acicular sublayer. The chitonids Sypharochiton pelliserpentis and S. sinclairi had the most complex microstructure layering with three crossed lamellar, two spherulitic sublayers, and a ventral acicular sublayer while the acanthochitonids Acanthochitona zelandica and Notoplax violacea as well as the ischnochitonid Ischnochiton maorianus had the simplest structure with one spherulitic, one crossed lamellar sublayer, and a ventral acicular sublayer. Terminal valves were less complex than intermediate valves and tended to be dominated by the crossed lamellar structure. The leptochitonid Leptochiton inquinatus generated a unique crossed lamellar sublayer different from the other analysed chitonids. Acanthochitona zelandica is the only analysed chitonid that utilizes two different crossed lamellar structures.

Therefore, it serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the development of antibacterial, antiparasitic and anticancer drugs. Herein, we report the biochemical characterization and crystal structure determination of thymidylate kinase from a hyperthermophilic organism Sulfolobus tokodaii (StTMK) in its apo and ADP-bound forms. Our study describes the first three-dimensional structure of an archaeal TMK. StTMK is a thermostable enzyme with optimum activity at 80°C. Despite the overall similarity to homologous TMKs, StTMK structures revealed several residue substitutions at the active site. However, enzyme assays demonstrated specificity to its natural substrates ATP and dTMP. Analysis of the structures also revealed multiple conformational states of Arg93 which is located at the reaction centre and is a part of the highly conserved DRX motif. Only one of these states was found to be suitable for the proper positioning of the α-phosphate group of dTMP at the active site. Computational alanine scanning and MM/PBSA binding energy calculation revealed the importance of Arg93 side chain in substrate binding. Subsequent site directed mutagenesis at this position to an Ala resulted in the loss of activity. Thus, the computational and biochemical studies reveal the importance of Arg93 for enzyme function, while the different conformational states of Arg93 observed in the structural studies imply its regulatory role in the catalytically competent placement of dTMP.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this study, we present the 2.5Å resolution crystal structure of a member (GH39wh2) from the human gut bacteria Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2 representative of a new subgroup within family GH39. Together with 6 other GHs, GH39wh2 belongs to a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) that could be involved in detecting, binding and hydrolysing a specific carbohydrate species from the intestinal tract. GH39wh2 shares a similar architecture as other members of family GH39 dominated by a typical (β/α)8-barrel fold harboring the catalytic residues and decorated by β-sandwich accessory domains. The GH39wh2 structure unveils an atypical shallow groove rather than a deep pocket due to drastic rearrangements in surface loops surrounding the catalytic interface. These structural adaptations seem to favour recognition of large branched substrates and may explain the lack of activity of GH39wh2 toward small xylose-based and other typical substrates from GH39 members, emphasizing the molecular diversity within the GH39 family.

Fast and sensitive detection of astigmatism is needed to provide real-time feedback and adjust the stigmators to efficiently reduce astigmatism. Currently the method used by many microscopists is to visually examine the roundness of a diffractogram (Thon rings) and iteratively adjust the stigmators to make the Thon rings circular. This subjective method is limited by poor sensitivity and potentially biased by the astigmatism of human eyes. In this study, an s2 power spectra based method, s2stigmator, was developed to allow fast and sensitive detection of the astigmatism in TEM live images. The ""radar""-style display provides real-time feedback to guide the adjustment of the objective lens stigmators. Such unique capability allowed us to discover the mapping of the two stigmators to the astigmatism amplitude and angle, which led us to develop a single-pass tuning strategy capable of significantly quicker minimization of the objective lens astigmatism.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite having a similar protein fold, members of this family have been implicated in diverse cellular processes and found in varied subcellular localizations. Very recently, the biochemical characterization of two evolutionary divergent TPM domains has shown that they are able to hydrolyze phosphate groups from different substrates. However, there are still incorrect functional annotations and uncertain relationships between the structure and function of this family of domains. BA41 is an uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein from the Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium Bizionia argentinensis with a predicted compact extracytoplasmic TPM domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic low complexity region. To shed light on the structural properties that enable TPM domains to adopt divergent roles, we here accomplish a comprehensive structural and functional characterization of the central TPM domain of BA41 (BA41-TPM). Contrary to its predicted function as a beta-propeller methanol dehydrogenase, light scattering and crystallographic studies showed that BA41-TPM behaves as a globular monomeric protein and adopts a conserved Rossmann fold, typically observed in other TPM domain structures. Although the crystal structure reveals the conservation of residues involved in substrate binding, no putative catalytic or intramolecular metal ions were detected. Most important, however, extensive biochemical studies demonstrated that BA41-TPM has hydrolase activity against ADP, ATP, and other di- and triphosphate nucleotides and shares properties of cold-adapted enzymes.

These techniques use two images at two different sample tilts. One of the most demanding steps in these methods at the image processing level is to identify corresponding particles on both micrographs, and manual or semiautomatic matching methods are usually used. Here we present an approach to solve this bottleneck with a fully automatic method for assigning particle tilt pairs. This new algorithm behaves correctly with a variety of samples, covering the range from small to large macromolecules and from sparse to densely populated fields of view. It is also more rapid than previous approaches. The roots of the method lie in a Delaunay triangulation of the set of independently picked coordinates on both the untilted and tilted micrographs. These triangulations are then used to search an affine transformation between the untilted and tilted triangles. The affine transformation that maximizes the number of correspondences between the two micrographs defines the coordinate matching.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous single molecule force spectroscopy studies demonstrated stretched exponential kinetics of protein unfolding under a constant pulling force, the molecular origin of which remains subject to debate. We here set out to extensively sample the mechanical unfolding of ubiquitin and NuG2 by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Both proteins show kinetics best fit by stretched exponentials, with stretching exponents similar to those found in experiments, even though static disorder is absent in our short MD simulations. Instead, we can ascribe non-exponential kinetics to dynamic disorder, due to conformational fluctuations on the nanosecond timescale.

Biominerals show interesting physical properties, controlled hierarchical structures and robust remodeling or repair mechanisms. Biological processes associated with biominerals remain to be developed into practical engineering processes. Therefore, the formation of biominerals is inspiring for the design of materials, especially those fabricated at ambient temperatures. The study described herein involves the influence of chicken outer eggshell membrane on the type of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorph deposited on the shell of the land snail Helix aspersa during the repair process after an injury. A piece of snail shell was removed by perforating a hole from the largest body whorl. The operated area was left either uncovered or covered with either a thermoplastic flexible polyolefin-based film Parafilm® or a piece of chicken eggshell membrane. The repaired shells of control and experimental animals were analyzed using SEM, EDS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. We found that in the presence of eggshell membrane, the polymorph deposited on the substratum during the first hours resembles calcite, the polymorph present in eggshell normal formation, but at 24 and 48h, when snail mantle cells produced their normal organic matrix (mainly β-chitin plus proteins and proteoglycans), the polymorph deposited is aragonite, the characteristic polymorph of Helix shell. Therefore, the eggshell membrane influences the type of polymorph, but only in the initial stages of biomineral deposition, before an organic matrix layer is deposited by the snail.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Therefore, this methodology is slow, intensive in human work and subjective. In this work, we propose a method to automatically or semiautomatically perform this image selection task. The approach is based on some simple, fast and effective image quality descriptors, which can be computed during acquisition, to characterize foil-hole and data images. The proposed approach has been used to evaluate the quality of different datasets consisting of foil-hole and data images obtained with a FEI Titan Krios electron microscope.

Since the crystal contacts are the same between the two alternative crystal forms of outward open UlaA, the striking biological differences noted, including rearranged hydrogen bonds and salt bridge coordination, are not attributable to crystal packing differences.

This can be achieved using serial FIB milling and block face surface imaging under cryo conditions. Here we demonstrate the unique potential of the cryo-FIB-SEM approach using two extensively studied model systems; sea urchin embryos and the tail fin of zebrafish larvae. We focus in particular on the environment of mineral deposition sites. The cellular organelles, including mitochondria, Golgi, ER, nuclei and nuclear pores are made visible by the image contrast created by differences in surface potential of different biochemical components. Auto segmentation and/or volume rendering of the image stacks and 3D reconstruction of the skeleton and the cellular environment, provides a detailed view of the relative distribution in space of the tissue/cellular components, and thus of their interactions. Simultaneous acquisition of secondary and back-scattered electron images adds additional information. For example, a serial view of the zebrafish tail reveals the presence of electron dense mineral particles inside mitochondrial networks extending more than 20μm in depth in the block.

Glycoside hydrolase family 63 (GH63) is composed of inverting α-glycosidases, which act mainly on α-glucosides. We previously found that Escherichia coli GH63 enzyme, YgjK, can hydrolyze 2-O-α-d-glucosyl-d-galactose. Two constructed glycosynthase mutants, D324N and E727A, which catalyze the transfer of a β-glucosyl fluoride donor to galactose, lactose, and melibiose. Here, we determined the crystal structures of D324N and E727A soaked with a mixture of glucose and lactose at 1.8- and 2.1-Å resolutions, respectively. Because glucose and lactose molecules are found at the active sites in both structures, it is possible that these structures mimic the enzyme-product complex of YgjK. A glucose molecule found at subsite -1 in both structures adopts an unusual 1S3 skew-boat conformation. Comparison between these structures and the previously determined enzyme-substrate complex structure reveals that the glucose pyranose ring might be distorted immediately after nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. These structures represent the first enzyme-product complex for the GH63 family, as well as the structurally-related glycosidases, and it may provide insight into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

As previously shown for plastic sections, STEM has a number of advantages for cryo-imaging compared to conventional wide-field TEM imaging. STEM is insensitive to phase coherence and is therefore suitable for much thicker specimens than TEM. Imaging in focus, with a long depth of field, also circumvents the complications of an oscillatory contrast transfer function and missing information at low spatial frequencies. Moreover the image signal represents a quantitative measurement of the electron scattering pixel by pixel, so that absolute intensities can be interpreted in terms of material properties in the specimen. Resolution, however, is undoubtedly compromised for thick samples, especially in the regime of multiple elastic scattering. In this work we address the specific issues that arise in cryo-tomography of thick biological specimens. We formulate an imaging model based on a Boltzmann transport equation, complemented by Monte Carlo simulations. Using these theoretical tools, we identify conditions for image acquisition that will be compatible with the basic presumption of tomographic reconstruction, i.e., that for a given composition the imaging signal varies monotonically with thickness. For optimal resolution, contrast, and signal strength, we propose to generalize the on-axis bright field detector to collect at angles well beyond the illumination cone.

All -ssRNA viruses encode a nucleocapsid protein (NP) to encapsidate the viral genome, which, together with polymerase, forms a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) that is packaged into virions and acts as the template for viral replication and transcription. In our previous work, we solved the monomeric structure of NP encoded by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which belongs to the Nairovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family, and revealed its unusual endonuclease activity. However, the mechanism of CCHFV RNP formation remains unclear, due to the difficulty in reconstructing the oligomeric CCHFV NP-RNA complex. Here, we identified and isolated the oligomeric CCHFV NP-RNA complex that formed in expression cells. Sequencing of RNA extracted from the complex revealed sequence specificity and suggested a potential encapsidation signal facilitating the association between NP and viral genome. A cryo-EM reconstruction revealed the ring-shaped architecture of the CCHFV NP-RNA oligomer, thus defining the interaction between the head and stalk domains that results in NP multimerization. This structure also suggested a modified gating mechanism for viral genome encapsidation, in which both the head and stalk domains participate in RNA binding.

Here, we applied this new technology to the activation of the human complement system. Binding of C1 to antigen-antibody complexes initiates a cascade of proteolytic events that deposits molecules onto adjacent surfaces and terminates with the formation of membrane-attack-complex (MAC) pores in the targeted membranes. We imaged steps in this process using a Volta phase plate mounted on a Titan Krios equipped with a Falcon-II direct electron detector. The data show patches of single-layer antibodies on the surface and C1 bound to antibody platforms, with ca. ∼4% of instances where C1r and C1s proteases have dissociated from C1, and potentially instances of C1 transiently interacting with its substrate C4 or product C4b. Next, extensive deposition of C4b and C3b molecules is apparent, although individual molecules cannot always be properly distinguished with the current methods. Observations of MAC pores include formation of both single and composite pores, and instances of potential soluble-MAC dissociation upon failure of membrane insertion. Overall, application of the Volta phase plate cryoET markedly improved the contrast in the tomograms, which allowed for individual components to be more readily interpreted. However, variability in the phase shift induced by the phase-plate during the course of an experiment, together with incomplete sampling during tomogram acquisition, limited the interpretability of the resulting tomograms.

In particular, the quaternary structure is 'clamped' using a C-terminal stretch of the N-domain, which endows the tetrameric molecule with additional stability and its characteristic shape.

UAF1 is a WD40 repeat protein, which binds and activates three important DUBs, USP1, USP12 and USP46.

In the complex we find two potential sites for UAF1 binding, analogous to what was seen in a USP46/UAF1 complex. In line with these observed dual binding states, we show here that USP12/UAF1 complex has 1:2 stoichiometry in solution, with a two-step binding at 4 nM and 325 nM respectively. Mutagenesis studies show that the fingers sub-domain of USP12 interacts with UAF1 to form the high affinity interface. Our activation studies confirm that the high affinity binding is important for activation while the second UAF1 binding does not affect activation. Nevertheless, we show that this two step binding is conserved in the well-studied USP12 paralog, USP1.

The biomacromolecules that most strongly interact with the growing crystals frequently get occluded within. Such an observation has been recently obtained for the calcium carbonate producing coccolithophore species Pleurochrysis carterae. Coccolithophores are unicellular algae that produce calcified scales built from complex-shaped calcite crystals, termed coccoliths. It is unclear how widespread the phenomenon of biomacromolecular occlusion within calcite crystals is in calcifying haptophytes such as coccolithophores. Here, the coccoliths of biological replicates of the bloom forming Emiliania huxleyi are compared with that of Pleurochrysis carterae, two species with different coccolith morphologies and crystal growth mechanisms. From high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, changes in the lattice parameters of coccolith calcite, after heating to 450°C, are observed and associated with macrostrain originating from occluded biomacromolecules.

Teeth that are anchored in the jaw through the periodontal ligament exert very large localized loads during mastication that could lead to a unique adaptation of the collagen/mineral structure in the bone. Our aim was to characterize the nanostructure of alveolar bone and to determine the influence of diabetes on structural characteristics of the mineralized matrix. Using small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), we studied a spontaneous diabetic mouse model (KK+) and its corresponding healthy controls (KK-) (n=6) to determine the size and mutual alignment of the mineral nanoparticles embedded in the collagen matrix. On cross-sections (buccal-lingual) of the first molar multiple line scans with a spatial resolution of 30μm were performed on each sample, from the lingual to the buccal side of the mandible. Mineral particle thickness and length are decreasing towards the tooth in both buccal and lingual sides of alveolar bone. While mineral particles are well aligned with the long axis of the tooth on the buccal side, they are in a quarter of the measurements oriented along two preferred directions on the lingual side. These nanostructural differences can be interpreted as the result of an asymmetric loading during mastication, leading to a tilting of the tooth in its socket.

They are found to occur quite frequently in protein structures, with their number exceeding that of π-helices, though it is considerably less than that of α-helices and β-strands. A relatively new procedure, ASSP, for the identification of regular secondary structures using Cα trace identifies 3597 PPII-helices in 3582 protein chains, solved at resolution ⩽2.0Å. Taking advantage of this significantly expanded database of PPII-helices, we have analyzed their structural and functional roles as well as determined the amino acid propensity within and around them. Though Pro residues are highly preferred, their presence is not a mandatory requirement for the formation of PPII-helices, since ∼40% PPII-helices were found to contain no Pro residues. Aromatic amino acids are avoided within this helix, while Gly, Asn and Asp residues are preferred in the proximal flanking regions. The PPII-helices range from 3 to 13 residues in length with the average twist and rise being -121.2°±9.2° and 3.0Å±0.1Å respectively.

Two key questions in protein folding are (1) why many proteins adopt a folded state and (2) how these proteins transition from the random coil ensemble to a folded state. In this paper we employ molecular dynamics simulations to address the first of these questions. Computational methods are well-placed to address this issue due to their ability to analyze systems at atomic-level resolution. Traditionally, the stability of folded proteins has been ascribed to the balance of two types of intermolecular interactions: hydrogen-bonding interactions and hydrophobic contacts. In this study, we explore a third type of intermolecular interaction: cooperative hydration of protein surface residues. To achieve this, we consider multiple independent simulations of the villin headpiece domain to quantify the contributions of different interactions to the energy of the native and fully extended states. In addition, we consider whether these findings are robust with respect to the protein forcefield, the water model, and the presence of salt. In all cases, we identify many cooperatively hydrated interactions that are transient but energetically favor the native state. Whilst further work on additional protein structures, forcefields, and water models is necessary, these results suggest a role for cooperative hydration in protein folding that should be explored further. Rational design of cooperative hydration on the protein surface could be a viable strategy for increasing protein stability.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This approach is demonstrated by determining the electron density of a virus crystal with 5-fold non-crystallographic symmetry, starting with only a spherical shell envelope. The electron density obtained is sufficiently accurate for model building.

Apparently, these two key features are closely related, underlining the fact that the formation of biominerals and their biomimetics does not necessarily follow classical crystallization routes, and leaves a characteristic nanotextural imprint which may help to disclose their origins and formation mechanisms. Here we present a general overview of the current theories and models of nonclassical crystallization and their applicability for the advance of our current understanding of biomineralization and biomimetic mineralization. We pay particular attention to the link between nonclassical crystallization routes and the resulting nanogranular textures of biomimetic CaCO3 mineral structures. After a general introductory section, we present an overview of classical nucleation and crystal growth theories and their limitations. Then, we introduce the Ostwald's step rule as a general framework to explain nonclassical crystallization. Subsequently, we describe nonclassical crystallization routes involving stable prenucleation clusters, dense liquid and solid amorphous precursor phases, as well as current nonclassical crystal growth models.

The stored calcium is used for the calcification of parts of the skeleton regularly renewed for allowing growth. Structural and molecular analyses of gastroliths have been primarily performed on three crayfish species, Orconectes virilis, Procambarus clarkii, and more recently, Cherax quadricarinatus. We have performed high-resolution analyses of gastroliths from the native noble crayfish, Astacus astacus, focusing on the microstructure, the mineralogical and elemental composition and distribution in a comparative perspective. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations showed a classical layered microstructure composed of 200-nm diameter granules aligned along fibers. These granules are themselves composed of agglomerated nanogranules of 50nm-mean diameters. Denser regions of bigger fused granules are also present. Micro-Raman spectroscopy show that if A. astacus gastroliths, similarly to the other analyzed gastroliths, are mainly composed of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), they are also rich in amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). The presence of a carotenoid pigment is also observed in A. astacus gastrolith contrary to C. quadricarinatus. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses demonstrate the presence of minor elements such as Mg, Sr, Si and P. The distribution of this last element is particularly heterogeneous. X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) reveals an alternation of layers more or less rich in phosphorus evidenced in the mineral phase as well as in the organic matrix in different molecular forms.

Here we describe the determination of the crystal structures of three type IVa pilins proteins from the thermophile Thermus thermophilus. They form part of a cluster of pilus-like proteins within the genome; our results show that one, Tt1222, is very closely related to the main structural type IV pilin, PilA4. The other two, Tt1218 and Tt1219, also adopt canonical pilin-like folds but, interestingly, are most closely related to the structures of the type II secretion system pseudopilins, EpsI/GspI and XcpW/GspJ. GspI and GspJ have been shown to form a complex with another pseudopilin, GspK, and this heterotrimeric complex is known to play a key role in initiating assembly of a pseudopilus which is thought to drive the secretion process. The structural similarity of Tt1218 and Tt1219 to GspI and GspJ suggests that they might work in a similar way, to deliver functions associated with type IV pili in T. thermophilus, such as natural competence.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The methylation of MCPRs is essential for the chemical sensing and chemotactic bacterial mobility towards favorable chemicals or away from unfavorable ones. In this study, crystal structure of B. subtilis CheR (BsCheR) in complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) has been determined to 1.8Å resolution. This is the first report of crystal structure belonging to the pentapeptide-independent CheR (PICheR) class. Till date, only one crystal structure of CheR from S. typhimurium (StCheR) belonging to pentapeptide-dependent CheR (PDCheR) class is available. Structural analysis of BsCheR reveals a helix-X-helix motif (HXH) with Asp53 as the linker residue in the N-terminal domain. The key structural features of the PDCheR β-subdomain involved in the formation of a tight complex with the pentapeptide binding motif in MCPRs were found to be absent in the structure of BsCheR. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed to investigate S-adenosyl-(l)-methionine (SAM) binding affinity and KD was determined to be 0.32mM. The structure of BsCheR reveals that mostly residues of the large C-terminal domain contribute to SAH binding, with contributions of few residues from the linker region and the N-terminal domain.

The atypical segment swap and the associated displacement of a region of the ferredoxin-like fold leads to a topology that is distinct from the original fold.

A recently-developed statistical energy function for backbone-based protein sequence design has been rationally revised to improve its accuracy. As a demonstrative example, this revised model is applied to design a de novo protein for a target backbone for which the previous model had relied on after-design directed evolution to produce a well-folded protein. The actual backbone structure of the newly designed protein agrees excellently with the corresponding target. Besides presenting a new protein design protocol with experimentally verifications on different backbone types, our study implies that with an energy model of an appropriate resolution, proteins of well-defined structures instead of molten globules can be designed without the explicit consideration of backbone variations due to side chain changes, even if the side chain changes correspond to complete sequence redesigns.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we present a combined use of multiple biophysical methods, termed iSPOT, an integration of shape information from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), protection factors probed by hydroxyl radical footprinting, and a large series of computationally docked conformations from rigid-body or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically tested on two model systems, the power of iSPOT is demonstrated to accurately predict the structures of a large protein-protein complex (TGFβ-FKBP12) and a multidomain nuclear receptor homodimer (HNF-4α), based on the structures of individual components of the complexes. Although neither SAXS nor footprinting alone can yield an unambiguous picture for each complex, the combination of both, seamlessly integrated in iSPOT, narrows down the best-fit structures that are about 3.2Å and 4.2Å in RMSD from their corresponding crystal structures, respectively. Furthermore, this proof-of-principle study based on the data synthetically derived from available crystal structures shows that the iSPOT-using either rigid-body or MD-based flexible docking-is capable of overcoming the shortcomings of standalone computational methods, especially for HNF-4α. By taking advantage of the integration of SAXS-based shape information and footprinting-based protection/accessibility as well as computational docking, this iSPOT platform is set to be a powerful approach towards accurate integrated modeling of many challenging multiprotein complexes.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The lack of economic impact for extant species is probably liable for that situation. Much attention has been on the microstructure of calcite biomaterials (rhynchonelliforms and craniiforms). Here, we emphasize the sub-micrometric structure of selected examples of rhynchonelliform shells using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to complement Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses. The hierarchical organization of the shell layers (secondary and/or tertiary elements) is highlighted for species non-yet observed from this point of view, and is compared to a few already mentioned in the literature. Previous analysis revealed that granules are composed of a complex aggregation of sub-units in intimate relation with an intracrystalline matrix. Their shape, size and probably early orientation depend on the species as well as age and living environments of the specimens studied. The control of the inorganic part of the composite fibrous elements is constrained by the deposition of nearly arched shape or polygonal protein membranes at the inner boundary of the primary layer, prior to the deposition of the first granules, membranes becoming proteinaceous sheathes progressively enshrining fibres. The diverse orientations of the granules in fibrous neighbours thus further increase arguments in favour of the tendency to improve the shell strength.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous studies focused on phage infection in Gram-negative bacteria but it is of particular interest how phages penetrate the thick, highly cross-linked Gram-positive cell wall. Here we detail structural intermediates of phage Φ29 during infection of Bacillus subtilis. Use of a minicell-producing strain facilitated in situ tomographic reconstructions of infecting phage particles. Φ29 initially contacts the cell wall at an angle through a subset of the twelve appendages, which are attached to the collar at the head proximal portion of the tail knob. The appendages are flexible and switch between extended and downward conformations during this stage of reversible adsorption; appendages enzymatically hydrolyze wall teichoic acids to bring the phage closer to the cell. A cell wall-degrading enzyme at the distal tip of the tail knob locally digests peptidoglycan, facilitating penetration of the tail further into the cell wall, and the phage particle reorients so that the tail becomes perpendicular to the cell surface. All twelve appendages attain the same ""down"" conformation during this stage of adsorption. Once the tail has become totally embedded in the cell wall, the tip can fuse with the cytoplasmic membrane. The membrane bulges out, presumably to facilitate genome ejection into the cytoplasm, and the deformation remains after complete ejection.

During metacyclogenesis - the transformation of epimastigotes into human-infective metacyclic trypomastigotes - the cytostome-cytopharynx complex disappears, as trypomastigotes lose endocytic ability. To date, no studies have examined cytostome-cytopharynx complex disappearance in detail, or determined if endocytic activity persists during metacyclogenesis. Here, we produced 3D reconstructions of metacyclogenesis intermediates (Ia, Ib, Ic) using electron microscopy tomography and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), concentrating on the cytostome-cytopharynx complex and adjacent structures, including the preoral ridge (POR). Parasite endocytic potential was examined by incubation of intermediate forms with the endocytic tracer transferrin (Tf)-Au. Ia, Ib and Ic cells were capable of internalizing Tf-Au, and had a shorter cytopharynx than that of epimastigotes, with the cytostome/POR progressively displaced towards the posterior, following the movement of the kinetoplast/flagellar pocket. While some Ic cells had a short cytopharynx with an enlarged proximal end (∼300nm in diameter, larger than that of the cytostome), other Ic cells had no cytopharynx invagination, but retained the cytopharynx microtubules, which were also present in metacyclics. We conclude that cytostome-cytopharynx disappearance and loss of endocytic ability are late events in metacyclogenesis, during which the cytostome is displaced towards the posterior, probably due to a link to the kinetoplast/flagellar pocket. Retention of the cytopharynx microtubules by metacyclics may allow prompt cytostome-cytopharynx reassembly in amastigotes, upon host cell infection.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Much is now understood about the structure-function relationships defining this remarkable proteinaceous bio-fiber; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinctive tough, viscoelastic and self-healing behavior are still unclear. Here, we investigate elastic and dissipative contributions from the primary load-bearing proteins in the distal region of byssal threads (the preCols) using X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with in situ tensile testing. Specifically, we identified cross β-sheet structure in the preCol flanking domains that functions as an elastic framework, providing hidden length. Dissipative behavior was associated with a strain-rate dependent phase transition of a sacrificial network stabilized by strong, reversible cross-links.

Mutations in calpain-5 cause autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV, OMIM#193235). The structure of calpain-5 has not been determined, thus hindering the investigation of its proteolytic targets and pathological role in ADNIV. Herein, we report models of the proteolytic core of calpain-5 (mini-calpain-5) containing two globular domains (termed DIIa-IIb) connected by a short, flexible linker, consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. Structural modeling in the absence of calcium suggests that mini-calpain-5 adopts a more open conformation when compared to previously determined structures of other calpain cores. This open conformation, achieved by a rotation of DIIa and DIIb with respect to each other, prevents formation of the active site and constrains the enzyme in an inactivated form. The relative domain rotation of 60-100° we found for mini-calpain-5 (a non-classical calpain) is significantly greater than the largest rotation previously observed for a classical calpain (i.e., 55.0° for mini-calpain-9). Together with our prediction that, in the full-length form, a long loop in DIIb (loop C1), a few residues downstream of the inter-domain linker, likely interacts with the shorter, acidic, inactivating loop on domain-III (DIII), these structural insights illuminate the complexity of calpain regulation. Moreover, our studies argue that pursuing higher resolution structural studies are necessary to understand the complex activity regulation prevalent in the calpain family and for the design of specific calpain inhibitors.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Most if not all of these structures have evolved for a particular physiological reason. The shapes of these structures are formed by physical forces that operate on membranes. To create particular shaped cells and cell organelles, membranes must undergo deformations which are determined by the structure and elasticity of the membrane and this process is most probable driven by proteins, lipids and/or interplay of both Zimmerberg and Kozlov (2006). Therefore, an important question of current cell biology in conjunction with physics and mathematics is to elucidate the functional cause for these different membrane morphologies as well as how they are formed. One of the most peculiar membrane shapes is observed in mitochondria. These organelles are surrounded by two membranes and especially the convoluted inner membrane displays a complex ultra-structure. A molecular understanding of how this membrane is shaped is missing to a large extent. Unlike membrane remodeling in classical curvature-dependent processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis, mitochondria are most likely shaped by integral membrane proteins.

The amino acid residues responsible for recognition of the MPG glucose moiety are spatially conserved in other CE-14 deacetylases. Molecular dynamics simulation of the structure of the Ph-Dac-GlcNAc2 complex indicated that the reducing GlcNAc residue is placed in a large intermolecular cleft and is not involved with specific interactions with the enzyme. This observation was consistent with results indicating that Ph-Dac displayed similar kinetic parameters for both GlcNAc and GlcNAc2.

Several developments enable the production of high-quality tomograms. When using fiducial markers for alignment, the markers to be tracked through the series are chosen automatically; if there is an excess of markers available, a well-distributed subset is selected that is most likely to track well. Marker positions are refined by applying an edge-enhancing Sobel filter, which results in a 20% improvement in alignment error for plastic-embedded samples and 10% for frozen-hydrated samples. Robust fitting, in which outlying points are given less or no weight in computing the fitting error, is used to obtain an alignment solution, so that aberrant points from the automated tracking can have little effect on the alignment. When merging two dual-axis tomograms, the alignment between them is refined from correlations between local patches; a measure of structure was developed so that patches with insufficient structure to give accurate correlations can now be excluded automatically. We have also developed a script for running all steps in the reconstruction process with a flexible mechanism for setting parameters, and we have added a user interface for batch processing of tilt series to the Etomo program in IMOD.

Here, we explore the ability of this differential conservation to evaluate fittings of atomic models in low-resolution cryo-EM maps and select models from the ensemble of solutions that are often proposed by different model fitting techniques. As a prelude, using a non-redundant and high-resolution structural dataset involving 125 permanent and 95 transient complexes, we confirm that core interface residues are conserved significantly better than nearby non-interface residues and this result is used in the cryo-EM map analysis. From the analysis of inter-component interfaces in a set of fitted models associated with low-resolution cryo-EM maps of ribosomes, chaperones and proteasomes we note that a few poorly conserved residues occur at interfaces. Interestingly a few conserved residues are not in the interface, though they are close to the interface. These observations raise the potential requirement of refitting the models in the cryo-EM maps. We show that sampling an ensemble of models and selection of models with high residue conservation at the interface and in good agreement with the density helps in improving the accuracy of the fit.

Here we report a deep learning framework, called DeepPicker, to address this problem and fill the current gaps toward a fully automated cryo-EM pipeline. DeepPicker employs a novel cross-molecule training strategy to capture common features of particles from previously-analyzed micrographs, and thus does not require any human intervention during particle picking. Tests on the recently-published cryo-EM data of three complexes have demonstrated that our deep learning based scheme can successfully accomplish the human-level particle picking process and identify a sufficient number of particles that are comparable to those picked manually by human experts. These results indicate that DeepPicker can provide a practically useful tool to significantly reduce the time and manual effort spent in single-particle analysis and thus greatly facilitate high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination.

They are widely distributed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, and exhibit diverse substrate specificity, post-translational modifications and cellular localization. While LAAOs isolated from snake venom have been extensively characterized, the structures and functions of LAAOs from other species are largely unknown. Here, we reported crystal structure of a bacterial membrane-bound LAAD from Proteus vulgaris (pvLAAD) in complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). We found that the overall fold of pvLAAD does not resemble typical LAAOs. Instead it, is similar to d-amino acid oxidases (DAAOs) with an additional hydrophobic insertion module on protein surface. Structural analysis and liposome-binding assays suggested that the hydrophobic module serves as an extra membrane-binding site for LAADs. Bacteria from genera Proteus and Providencia were found to encode two classes of membrane-bound LAADs. Based on our structure, the key roles of residues Q278 and L317 in substrate selectivity were proposed and biochemically analyzed. While LAADs on the membrane were proposed to transfer electrons to respiratory chain for FAD re-oxidization, we observed that the purified pvLAAD could generate a significant amount of hydrogen peroxide in vitro, suggesting it could use dioxygen to directly re-oxidize FADH2 as what typical LAAOs usually do. These findings provide a novel insights for a better understanding this class of enzymes and will help developing biocatalysts for industrial applications.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

TREX-2 can be subdivided into two modules: one, in which Thp1 and Sem1 bind to the Sac3M region (residues ∼100–551), and the other in which Cdc31 and two Sus1 chains bind to the Sac3CID region (residues ∼710–805). Complementary structural analyses using X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TREX-2 complex, expressed using Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, have indicated that the TPR-like repeats of the Sac3M region extend considerably further towards the N-terminus than previously thought, and also indicate that this region and Sac3CID:Sus1:Cdc31 region of the S. cerevisiae complex are structurally independent.

However, nano- and molecular features require more detailed characterization, such as use of e.g., vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray scattering. Nano- and molecular features also affect the mechanical competence of bone tissue. The aim of the present study was to reveal the effects of mineralization and its alterations on the mineral crystal scale, by investigating the spatial variation of molecular composition and mineral crystal structure across the cross-section of femur diaphyses in young rats, and healthy and osteoporotic mature rats (N=5). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) techniques with high spatial resolution were used at identical locations over the whole cross-section. This allowed quantification of point-by-point information about the spatial distribution of mineral crystal volume. All measured parameters (crystal dimensions, degree of orientation and predominant orientation) varied across the cortex. Specifically, the crystal dimensions were lower in the central cortex than in the endosteal and periosteal regions. Mineral crystal orientation followed the cortical circumference in the periosteal and endosteal regions, but was less well-oriented in the central regions. Central cortex is formed rapidly during development through endochondral ossification. Since rats possess no osteonal remodeling, this bone remains (until old age). Significant linear correlations were observed between the dimensional and organizational parameters, e.g., between crystal length and degree of orientation (R(2)=0.83, p<0.001).

TTR is potentially amyloidogenic due to homotetramer dissociation into monomeric intermediates that self-assemble as amyloid deposits and insoluble fibrils. Most crystallographic structures, including those of amyloidogenic variants show the same tetramer without major variations in the monomer-monomer interface nor in the volume of the interdimeric cavity. Soaking TTR crystals in a solution containing rhenium tris-carbonyl derivatives yields a TTR conformer never observed before. Only one of the two monomers of the crystallographic dimer is significantly altered, and the inner part of the T4 binding cavity is expanded at one end and shrunk at the other. The result redefines the mechanism of allosteric communication between the two sites, suggesting that negative cooperativity is a function of dimer asymmetry, which can be induced through internal or external binding. An aspect that remains unexplained is why the conformational changes are ubiquitous throughout the crystal although the heavy metal content of the derivatized crystals is relatively low. The conformational changes observed, which include Leu(82), may represent a form of TTR better at scavenging β-Amyloid. At a resolution of 1.69Å, with excellent refinement statistics and well defined electron density for all parts of the structure, it is possible to envisage answering important questions that range from protein cooperative behavior to heavy atom induced protein conformational modifications that can result in crystallographic non-isomorphism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

One such antiretroviral protein is the restriction factor Trim5α, that blocks HIV-1 infection in rhesus macaques at an early post-entry stage in the retroviral lifecycle. Trim5α self-assembles into a large hexagonal array, complimentary to the retroviral capsid. Assembly is mediated by the conserved N-terminal architecture comprising a RING domain, a Bbox domain, and a coiled coil. Recently we have shown that the Bbox domain and elements of the coiled coil form a trimer in solution, and that the Bbox domain drives assembly. During crystallisation experiments using the trimer forming construct, we determined the structure of a dimeric Bbox domain to a resolution of 1.8Å. Interface analysis reveals that residues previously shown to be required for assembly and restriction, Glu120 and Arg121, are central to the interface.

Imaging tau filaments and oligomers in human brain at high resolution would help contribute insight into the mechanism and progression of tauopathic diseases. STED microscopy is a nano-scale imaging technique and we aimed to test the abilities of this method for resolving tau structures within human brain. Using autopsied 50μm AD brain sections, we demonstrate that STED microscopy can resolve immunolabelled tau filaments at 77nm resolution. Ribbon-like tau filaments imaged by STED appeared smooth along their axis with limited axial undulations. STED also resolved 70-80nm wide tau puncta. Of the fluorophores tested, STAR635p was optimal for STED imaging in this tissue. This was in part due to brain tissue autofluorescence within the lower wavelength ranges (488-590nm). Further, the stability and minimal photobleaching of STAR635p allowed STED z-stacks of neurons packed with tau filaments (neurofibrillary tangles) to be collated. There was no loss of x-y image resolution of individual tau filaments through the 20μm z-stack. This demonstrates that STED can contribute to nano-scale analysis and characterisation of pathologies within banked human autopsied brain tissue. Resolving tau structures at this level of resolution provides promising avenues for understanding mechanisms of pathology propagation in the different tauopathies as well as illuminating what contributes to disease heterogeneity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This ability is due to their magnetosome chain, each magnetosome consisting on a magnetic crystal enveloped by a lipid bilayer membrane to which very unique proteins are associated. Magnetotactic bacteria exquisitely control magnetosome formation, making the magnetosomes the ideal magnetic nanoparticle of potential use in many technological applications.

Herein, we propose the synthesis of composite materials through the mineralization of a recombinant collagen type I derived protein (RCP) enriched with RGD sequences in the presence of magnesium ions (Mg) to closer mimic bone composition. The role of both RCP and Mg ions in controlling the precipitation of the mineral phase is in depth evaluated. TEM and X-ray powder diffraction reveal the crystallization of nanocrystalline apatite (Ap) in all the evaluated conditions. However, Raman spectra point out also the precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP). This amorphous phase is more evident when RCP and Mg are at work, indicating the synergistic role of both in stabilizing the amorphous precursor. In addition, hybrid matrices are prepared to tentatively address their effectiveness as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. SEM and AFM imaging show an homogeneous mineral distribution on the RCP matrix mineralized in presence of Mg, which provides a surface roughness similar to that found in bone. Preliminary in vitro tests with pre-osteoblast cell line show good cell-material interaction on the matrices prepared in the presence of Mg.

Aberrant HDAC activity is associated with cancer, making these enzymes important targets for drug design. In general, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) block the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and/or apoptosis, and comprise some of the leading therapies in cancer treatments. To date, four HDACi have been FDA approved for the treatment of cancers: suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat, Zolinza®), romidepsin (FK228, Istodax®), belinostat (Beleodaq®), and panobinostat (Farydak®).

Base-pairs formed at the interface between micelles bring them into proximity with each other; and when the conjugated micelles contain a membrane protein, crystal nucleation centers can be stabilized, thereby promoting crystal growth. Accordingly, two hydrophobic nucleoside derivatives - deoxyguanosine (G) and deoxycytidine (C), each covalently bonded to a 10 carbon chain were synthesized and added to an aqueous solution containing octyl β-d-thioglucopyranoside micelles. These hydrophobic nucleosides induced the formation of oil-rich globules after 2days incubation at 19°C or after a few hours in the presence of ammonium sulfate; however, phase separation was inhibited by 100mM GMP. The presence of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin in the conjugated - micellar dispersion resulted in the growth within the colorless globules of a variety of purple crystals, the color indicating a functional protein.

Here we provide further insight into the changes occurring in retroviral Env during its initial interaction with the cell, employing murine leukemia virus (MLV) as model system. We first determined the structure of both natively membrane anchored MLV Env and MLV Env tagged with YFP in the proline rich region (PRR) by electron cryo tomography (cET) and sub-volume averaging. At a resolution of ∼20 Å, native MLV Env presents as a hollow trimer (height ∼85 Å, diameter ∼120 Å) composed of step-shaped protomers. The major difference to the YFP-tagged protein was in regions outside of the central trimer. Next, we focused on elucidating the changes in MLV Env upon interaction with a host cell. Virus interaction with the plasma membrane occurred over a large surface and Env clustering on the binding site was observed. Sub-volume averaging did yield a low-resolution structure of Env interacting with the cell, which had lost its threefold symmetry and was elongated by ∼35 Å in comparison to the unbound protein. This indicates a major rearrangement of Env upon host cell binding.

Thereby, the CTF is first estimated and subsequently the electron micrograph is corrected, so that the negative oscillations of the CTF are equalized. Typically, the CTF correction is performed in 2D and the tilt-induced focus gradient is taken into account. Most often, the sample-thickness-induced focus gradient is ignored. Theoretical considerations, as well as implementation suggestions, for a 3D CTF correction that considers both gradients have been proposed before, although an implementation achieving a resolution improvement has been lacking, primarily due to computational reasons. Here, we present a comprehensive solution for a 3D CTF correction based on the Jensen-Kornberg scheme, which performs a slice-by-slice correction of the CTF within the tomographic reconstruction. We show that the computational requirements are comparable to those of 2D CTF correction. Using the examples of mitochondrial ribosomes and tobacco mosaic virus we demonstrate the improvement of the reconstruction quality with the 3D CTF correction, and the resolution gain on sub-tomogram averaging. More interestingly, for tomographic applications, the quality of the individual sub-tomograms before averaging increases significantly. We find that 3D CTF correction always produces equal or better results than 2D CTF correction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we report six crystal structures of the wild-type and a non-glycosylated mutant of the bifunctional inhibitor E3Ad obtained at different pH values and space groups. The crystal structures show that E3Ad adopts the typical β-trefoil fold of the STI family exhibiting some conformational changes due to pH variations and crystal packing. Despite the high sequence identity with a recently reported potato cathepsin D inhibitor (PDI), three-dimensional structures obtained in this work show a significant conformational change in the protease-binding loop proposed for aspartic protease inhibition. The E3Ad binding loop for serine protease inhibition is also proposed, based on structural similarity with a novel non-canonical conformation described for the double-headed inhibitor API-A from the Kunitz-type STI family. In addition, structural and sequence analyses suggest that bifunctional inhibitors of serine and aspartic proteases from the Kunitz-type STI family are more similar to double-headed inhibitor API-A than other inhibitors with a canonical protease-binding loop.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Structural and crystallographic analyses of the skeletons have been done by petrographic microscopy, electron scanning microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), computer-integrated polarization microscopy (CIP) and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA). Calceola skeletons have many similarities with other cnidarians, mainly with other Palaeozoic corals as Syringoporicae: The microcrystals are composed of co-oriented nanocrystals that remind to mesocrystals, suggesting a biocrystallization process by particle attachment (CPA). The relationship between the nanocrystals and microcrystals suggest a growth mode similar to mineral bridges. A similar model was described for Syringoporicae corals (Tabulata) and it is similar to the coordinated-growth mode described in scleractinians and molluscs. Calceola skeletons show also a convergent structure with scleractinian forming Rapid Accretion Deposits (RAD), which share some structural and chemical properties.

We analyzed the microscopic architecture of dactylus claws in the woodlice Porcellio scaber and correlated these observations with analyses of the claws' mineral composition with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Extraordinarily, amorphous calcium phosphate is the predominant mineral in the claw endocuticle. Unlike the strongly calcified exocuticle of the dactylus base, the claw exocuticle is devoid of mineral and is highly brominated. The architecture of the dactylus claw cuticle is drastically different from that of other parts of the exoskeleton. In contrast to the quasi-isotropic structure with chitin-protein fibers oriented in multiple directions, characteristic of the arthropod exoskeleton, the chitin-protein fibers and mineral components in the endocuticle of P. scaber claws are exclusively axially oriented. Taken together, these characteristics suggest that the claw cuticle is highly structurally anisotropic and fracture resistant and can be explained as adaptations to predominant axial loading of the thin, elongated claws.

Despite significant advances in the field, the resolution of the resulting three-dimensional images is still typically insufficient for de novo model building. To bridge the resolution gap and give an atomic interpretation to the data, high-resolution models are typically placed into the density as rigid bodies. Unfortunately, this is often done manually using graphics software, a subjective method that can lead to over-interpretation of the data. A more objective approach is to perform an exhaustive cross-correlation-based search to fit subunits into the density. Here we show, using five experimental ribosome maps ranging in resolution from 5.5 to 6.9Å, that cross-correlation-based fitting is capable of successfully fitting subunits correctly in the density for over 90% of the cases. Importantly, we provide indicators for the reliability and ambiguity of a fit, using the Fisher z-transformation and its associated confidence intervals, giving a formal approach to identify over-interpreted regions in the density. In addition, we quantify the resolution requirement for a successful fit as a function of the subunit size. For larger subunits the resolution of the data can be down-filtered to 20Å while still retaining an unambiguous fit. We leverage this information through the use of multi-scale image pyramids to accelerate the search up to 30-fold on CPUs and 40-fold on GPUs at a negligible loss in success rate.

CryoET data is collected as a series of images of the sample from different tilt angles; this is performed by physically rotating the sample in the microscope between each image. The angles at which the images are collected, and the order in which they are collected, together are called the tilt-scheme. Here we describe a “dose-symmetric tilt-scheme” that begins at low tilt and then alternates between increasingly positive and negative tilts. This tilt-scheme maximizes the amount of high-resolution information maintained in the tomogram for subsequent subtomogram averaging, and may also be advantageous for other applications.

These flaps are known to be essential for the catalytic activity of the HIV-PR, but their exact conformations at the different stages of the enzymatic pathway remain subject to debate. Understanding the correct functional dynamics of the flaps might aid the development of new HIV-PR inhibitors. It is known that, the HIV-PR catalytic efficiency is pH-dependent, likely due to the influence of processes such as charge transfer and protonation/deprotonation of ionizable residues. Several Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have reported information about the HIV-PR flaps. However, in MD simulations the protonation of a residue is fixed and thus it is not possible to study the correlation between conformation and protonation state. To address this shortcoming, this work attempts to capture, through Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD), the conformations of the apo, substrate-bound and inhibitor-bound HIV-PR, which differ drastically in their flap arrangements. The results show that the HIV-PR flaps conformations are defined by the protonation of the catalytic residues Asp25/Asp25' and that these residues are sensitive to pH changes.

Elliptic distortions of ∼1-3% have been reported for multiple microscopes under low magnification settings (e.g., 18,000×), which significantly limited the achievable resolution of single particle 3-D reconstruction, especially for large particles. Here we report a generic algorithm that formulates the distortion correction problem as a generalized 2-D alignment task and estimates the distortion parameters directly from the particle images. Unlike the present pre-calibration methods, our computational method is applicable to all datasets collected at a broad range of magnifications using any microscope without need of additional experimental measurements. Moreover, the per-micrograph and/or per-particle level elliptic distortion estimation in our method could resolve potential distortion variations within a cryo-EM dataset, and further improve the 3-D reconstructions relative to constant-value correction by the pre-calibration methods. With successful applications to multiple datasets and cross-validation with the pre-calibration method, we have demonstrated the validity and robustness of our algorithm in estimating the distortion; correction of the elliptic distortion significantly improved the achievable resolutions by ∼1-3 folds and enabled 3-D reconstructions of multiple viral structures at 2.4-2.6Å resolutions.

In the case of membrane proteins, formation of tubular crystals with helical symmetry represents an attractive alternative, especially when their small size precludes the use of single-particle analysis. An essential first step for helical reconstruction is to characterize the helical symmetry. This process is often daunting, due to the complexity of helical diffraction and to the low signal-to-noise ratio in images of individual assemblies. Furthermore, the large diameters of the tubular crystals produced by membrane proteins exacerbates the innate ambiguities that, if not resolved, will produce incorrect structures. In this report, we describe a set of tools that can be used to eliminate ambiguities and to validate the choice of symmetry. The first approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio along layer lines by incoherently summing data from multiple helical assemblies, thus producing several candidate indexing schemes. The second approach compares the layer lines from images with those from synthetic models built with the various candidate schemes. The third approach uses unit cell dimensions measured from collapsed tubes to distinguish between these candidate schemes.

Curli amyloid fibers are a major component of mature biofilms, which are produced by many Enterobacteriaceae species and are responsible, among other functions, for the initial adhesion of bacteria to surfaces or cells. The main axis of curli fibers is formed by a major structural subunit, known as CsgA. CsgA self-assembly is promoted by oligomeric nuclei formed by a minor curli subunit, known as the CsgB nucleator protein. Here, by implementing AMYLPRED2, a consensus prediction method for the identification of 'aggregation-prone' regions in protein sequences, developed in our laboratory, we have successfully identified potent amyloidogenic regions of the CsgB subunit. Peptide-analogues corresponding to the predicted 'aggregation-prone' segments of CsgB were chemically synthesized and studied, utilizing several biophysical techniques. Our experimental data indicate that these peptides self-assemble in solution, forming fibrils with characteristic amyloidogenic properties. Using comparative modeling techniques, we have developed three-dimensional models of both CsgA and CsgB subunits. Structural analysis revealed that the identified 'aggregation-prone' segments may promote gradual polymerization of CsgB. Briefly, our results indicate that the intrinsic self-aggregation propensity of the CsgB subunit, most probably has a pivotal role in initiating the formation of curli amyloid fibers by promoting the self-assembly process of the CsgB nucleator protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we assess the performance of the VPP compared to CTEM in subtomogram analysis, using the mammalian 80S ribosome as a test case. Accurate focusing is the major factor for achieving high resolution with the VPP, as highlighted by a comparison of slightly different focusing strategies. From only 1400 subtomograms, the VPP yields a subtomogram average of the mammalian 80S ribosome at 9.6Å resolution without laborious contrast transfer function (CTF) correction. The subtomogram averages obtained using CTEM approaches are comparable, but suffer from lower signal transfer in certain frequency bands due to the oscillations of the CTF.

Once the apical portion of the rostrum has been inserted into the preferred substrate for oviposition, the female begins rotating around the perimeter of the hole, elevating her head by extending the fore-legs, and rotating the head in place in a drilling motion. This action causes significant elastic deformation of the rostrum, which will bend until it becomes completely straight. To better understand the mechanical behavior of the cuticle as it undergoes deformation during the preparation of oviposition sites, we develop a comprehensive micro/macro model of the micromechanical structure and properties of the cuticle, spanning across all cuticular regions, and reliably mirroring the resultant macroscale properties of the cuticle. Our modeling approach relies on the use of multi-scale, hierarchical biomaterial representation, and employs various micromechanical schemata - e.g., Mori-Tanaka, effective field, and Maxwell - to calculate the homogenized properties of representative volume elements at each level in the hierarchy.

The first one, referred to as the 'lower dimer' (LD) was discovered many years ago by means of chemical crosslinking. Owing to its transient nature, a biological relevance had long been precluded when, using LD-specific antibodies, we detected LD-like contacts in actin assemblies that are associated with the endolysosomal compartment in a number of different cell lines. Moreover, immunofluorescence showed the presence of LD-related structures at the cell periphery of migrating fibroblasts, in the nucleus, and in association with the centrosome of interphase cells. Here, we explore contributions of the LD to the assembly of supramolecular actin structures in real time by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Our data shows that while LD on its own cannot polymerize under filament forming conditions, it is able to incorporate into growing F-actin filaments. This incorporation of LD triggers the formation of X-shaped filament assemblies with barbed ends that are pointing in the same direction in the majority of cases. Similarly, an increased frequency of junction sites was observed when filaments were assembled in the presence of oxidized actin. This data suggests that a disulfide bridge between Cys374 residues might stabilize LD-contacts. Based on our findings, we propose two possible models for the molecular mechanism underlying the supramolecular actin patterning in LD-related structures.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The active state requires interaction between the last two Ubls (USP7(45)) and the catalytic domain (USP7(CD)), and this can be promoted by allosteric interaction from the first 3 Ubl domains of USP7 (USP7(123)) interacting with GMPS. Here we study the transition between USP7 states. We provide a crystal structure of USP7(CD123) and show that CD and Ubl123 are connected via an extended charged alpha helix. Mutational analysis is used to determine whether the charge and rigidity of this 'connector helix' are important for full USP7 activity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Exploiting the promising biophysical features of the artificial protein Octarellin V, we improved this protein by directed evolution, thus creating a more stable and soluble protein: Octarellin V.1. Next, we obtained crystals of Octarellin V.1 in complex with crystallization chaperons and determined the tertiary structure. The experimental structure of Octarellin V.1 differs from its in silico design: the (αβα) sandwich architecture bears some resemblance to a Rossman-like fold instead of the intended TIM-barrel fold. This surprising result gave us a unique and attractive opportunity to test the state of the art in protein structure prediction, using this artificial protein free of any natural selection. We tested 13 automated webservers for protein structure prediction and found none of them to predict the actual structure. More than 50% of them predicted a TIM-barrel fold, i.e. the structure we set out to design more than 10years ago. In addition, local software runs that are human operated can sample a structure similar to the experimental one but fail in selecting it, suggesting that the scoring and ranking functions should be improved. We propose that artificial proteins could be used as tools to test the accuracy of protein structure prediction algorithms, because their lack of evolutionary pressure and unique sequences features.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Recent studies suggest inter-organelle membrane contact sites (MCSs) are hubs for this cellular cross-talk. MCSs also govern membrane remodeling, thus controlling aspects of organelle shape, identity, and function. Here, we summarize three emerging phenomena that MCSs appear to govern: 1) organelle identity via the non-vesicular exchange of lipids, 2) mitochondrial shape and division, and 3) endosomal migration in response to sterol trafficking. We also discuss the role for ER-endolysosomal contact sites in cholesterol metabolism, and the potential biomedical importance this holds.

Alignment of the Pf-Sp8/9 sequence with the amino acid sequences of related proteins showed that Pf-Sp8/9 had conserved domains, including three DNA-binding motifs. The tissue distribution showed that while Pf-Sp8/9 mRNA expression was detected in all tested tissues, it was particularly high in the mantle. The luciferase reporter assay results showed that Pf-Sp8/9 had the ability to activate the transcription of a number of matrix proteins.

Vaccinia virus, a member of the Poxviridae family, presents one of the most complex viral structures. The classical view of vaccinia virus structure consists of an envelope surrounding a biconcave core, with a lateral body in each concavity of the core. This classical view was challenged by Peters and Muller (1963), who demonstrated the presence of a folded tubular structure inside the virus core and stated the difficulty in visualizing this structure, possibly because it is labile and cannot be preserved by conventional sample preparation. Therefore, this tubular structure, now called the nucleocapsid, has been mostly neglected over the years. Earlier studies were able to preserve the nucleocapsid, but with low efficiency. In this study, we report the protocol (and troubleshooting) that resulted in preservation of the highest numbers of nucleocapsids in several independent preparations. Using this protocol, we were able to demonstrate an interdependence between the formation of the virus core wall and the nucleocapsid, leading to the hypothesis that an interaction exists between the major protein constituents of these compartments, A3 (core wall) and L4 (nucleocapsid). Our results show that high pressure freezing and freeze substitution can be used in more in-depth studies concerning the nucleocapsid structure and function.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

A hallmark feature of this response is the formation of large multinucleated cells: foreign body giant cells (FBGCs). Biomaterials like cross-linked and non-cross-linked collagen often induce the formation of FBGCs. It is unknown whether different biomaterials result in the formation of different FBGCs. To investigate this, we implanted cross-linked and non-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen subcutaneously in mice. After 21 days the implanted material was collected and prepared for ultrastructural analysis. More FBGCs formed on and between implants of cross-linked collagen compared to non-cross-linked material. The ultrastructural aspects of the FBGCs present on the two types of implants proved to be similar. On both materials, they formed long slender protrusions on the basolateral membrane, they were very rich in mitochondria, contained numerous nuclei, and showed signs of the presence of a clear zone facing the implanted material. Similar clear zones, that resemble osteoclastic features, were also seen in FBGCs generated in vitro on bone slices, but these cells did not form a ruffled border. However, similarities in ultrastructure such as the occurrence of slender protrusions and high mitochondrion content were also found in the FBGCs generated in vitro. These data indicate that FBGCs formed on different substrates share many morphological characteristics. The formation of long finger-like protrusions seemed typical for the FBGCs, in vivo as well as in vitro, however the function of these structures needs further analysis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Using both simulated and experimental data, in comparison to ART and weight back projection method, we proved that FIRT could generate a better reconstruction with reduced ray artifacts and significant improved correlation with the ground truth and partially restore the information at the non-sampled angular region, which was proved by investigating the 90° re-projection and by the cross-validation method.

In CWF, the covariance matrix of the projection images is used within the classical Wiener filtering framework for solving the image restoration deconvolution problem. Our estimation procedure for the covariance matrix is new and successfully corrects for the CTF.

In particular, proteins that adopt multiple conformations often evade crystallization in all biologically relevant states. Although computational de novo protein folding approaches often sample biologically relevant conformations, the selection of the most accurate model for different functional states remains a formidable challenge, in particular, for proteins with more than about 150 residues. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can obtain limited structural information for proteins in well-defined biological states and thereby assist in selecting biologically relevant conformations. The present study demonstrates that de novo folding methods are able to accurately sample the folds of 192-residue long soluble monomeric Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). The tertiary structures of the monomeric and homodimeric forms of BAX were predicted using the primary structure as well as 25 and 11 EPR distance restraints, respectively. The predicted models were subsequently compared to respective NMR/X-ray structures of BAX. EPR restraints improve the protein-size normalized root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD100) of the most accurate models with respect to the NMR/crystal structure from 5.9Å to 3.9Å and from 5.7Å to 3.3Å, respectively.

Among other functions, VWF is responsible for platelet adhesion at sites of injury via its A1 domain. Its adjacent VWF domain A2 exposes a cleavage site under shear to degrade long VWF fibers in order to prevent thrombosis. Recently, it has been shown that VWF A1/A2 interactions inhibit the binding of platelets to VWF domain A1 in a force-dependent manner prior to A2 cleavage. However, whether and how this interaction also takes place in longer VWF fragments as well as the strength of this interaction in the light of typical elongation forces imposed by the shear flow of blood remained elusive. Here, we addressed these questions by using single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), Brownian dynamics (BD), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our SMFS measurements demonstrate that the A2 domain has the ability to bind not only to single A1 domains but also to VWF A1A2 fragments. SMFS experiments of a mutant [A2] domain, containing a disulfide bond which stabilizes the domain against unfolding, enhanced A1 binding. This observation suggests that the mutant adopts a more stable conformation for binding to A1. We found intermolecular A1/A2 interactions to be preferred over intramolecular A1/A2 interactions. Our data are also consistent with the existence of two cooperatively acting binding sites for A2 in the A1 domain. Our SMFS measurements revealed a slip-bond behavior for the A1/A2 interaction and their lifetimes were estimated for forces acting on VWF multimers at physiological shear rates using BD simulations. Complementary fitting of AFM rupture forces in the MD simulation range adequately reproduced the force response of the A1/A2 complex spanning a wide range of loading rates. In conclusion, we here characterized the auto-inhibitory mechanism of the intramolecular A1/A2 bond as a shear dependent safeguard of VWF, which prevents the interaction of VWF with platelets.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we study different aspects of the biomineralization pathways in one system, the rapidly forming long bones of the chicken embryo. We mainly used cryo-fixation and cryo-electron imaging to preserve the often unstable mineral phases in the tissues. We show the presence of surprisingly large amounts of mineral particles located inside membrane-delineated vesicles in the bone forming tissue between the blood vessels and the forming bone surface. Some of these particles are also located inside mitochondrial networks. The surfaces of the forming bones in the extracellular space contain abundant aggregates of amorphous calcium phosphate particles, but these are not enveloped by vesicle membranes. In the bone resorbing region, osteoclasts also contain many particles in both mitochondrial networks and within vesicles. Some of these particles are present also between cells. These observations, together with the previously reported observation that CaP mineral particles inside membranes are present in blood vessels, leads us to the conclusion that important components of the bone mineralization pathways in rapidly forming chicken bone are dense phase mineral particles bound within membranes. It remains to be determined whether these mineral particles are transported to the site of bone formation in the solid state, fluid state or dissolve and re-precipitate.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Polished spicules had specific concentric patterns that varied depending on the plane in which the spicules were sectioned. A 3D model of the concentric layers was created to interpret these patterns and the biomineralization process of the triactine spicules. The morphology of the spicules was compared with the crystallographic orientation of the calcite crystals by analyzing the Kikuchi diffraction patterns using a scanning electron microscope. Triactine spicules from the subclass Calcinea had actines (rays) elongated in the 〈210〉 direction, which is perpendicular to the c-axis. The scale spicules of the hypercalcified species Murrayona phanolepis presented the c-axis perpendicular to the plane of the scale, which is in accordance with the crystallography of all other Calcinea. The triactine spicules of the calcaronean species had approximately the same crystallographic orientation with the unpaired actine elongated in the ∼[211] direction. Only one Calcaronea species, whose triactine was regular, had a different orientation. Three different crystallographic orientations were found in diactines.

The crystal structure of deoxygenated Hb S (DeoxyHb S) and other studies suggest that the polymer is initiated by a primary interaction between the mutation βVal6 from one Hb S molecule, and a hydrophobic acceptor pocket formed by the residues βAla70, βPhe85 and βLeu88 of an adjacent located Hb S molecule. On the contrary, oxygenated or liganded Hb S does not polymerize or incorporate in the polymer. In this paper we present the crystal structure of carbonmonoxy-ligated sickle Hb (COHb S) in the quaternary classical R-state at 1.76Å.

This element called the β-interface loop contributes 20-30% of the total buried surface area at intersubunit interfaces of the functional hexameric state. To test whether this loop is an enabling region for the structure and function of the oligomeric assembly, we designed a truncation variant of the thermostable CE7 acetyl esterase from Thermotoga maritima (TmAcE). Although deletion of 26 out of 40 residues in the loop had little impact on the hexamer formation, the variant exhibited altered dynamics of the oligomeric assembly and a loss of thermal stability. Furthermore, the mutant lacked catalytic activity. Crystal structures of the variant and a new crystal form of the wild type protein determined at 2.75Å and 1.76Å, respectively, provide a rationale for the properties of the variant. The hexameric assembly in the variant is identical to that of the wild type and differed only in the lack of buried surface area interactions at the original intersubunit interfaces. This is accompanied by disorder in an extended region of the truncated loop that consequently induces disorder in the neighboring oxyanion hole loop. Overall, the results suggest that the β-interface loop in CE7 enzymes is dispensable for the oligomeric assembly.

One such mechanism involves the degradation of excessive or abnormal nucleotides by nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzymes. YpgQ contains the histidine-aspartate (HD) domain that is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotides or nucleic acids, but the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of YpgQ have never been characterized. Here, we unravel the catalytic activity and structural features of YpgQ to report the first Mn(2+)-dependent pyrophosphohydrolase that hydrolyzes (deoxy)ribonucleoside triphosphate [(d)NTP] to (deoxy)ribonucleoside monophosphate and pyrophosphate using the HD domain. YpgQ from Bacillus subtilis (bsYpgQ) displays a helical structure and assembles into a unique dimeric architecture that has not been observed in other HD domain-containing proteins. Each bsYpgQ monomer accommodates a metal ion and a nucleotide substrate in a cavity located between the N- and C-terminal lobes. The metal cofactor is coordinated by the canonical residues of the HD domain, namely, two histidine residues and two aspartate residues, and is positioned in close proximity to the β-phosphate group of the nucleotide, allowing us to propose a nucleophilic attack mechanism for the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction. YpgQ enzymes from other bacterial species also catalyze pyrophosphohydrolysis but exhibit different substrate specificity. Comparative structural and mutational studies demonstrated that residues outside the major substrate-binding site of bsYpgQ are responsible for the species-specific substrate preference.

However, a plethora of biological systems exhibit the counter-intuitive phenomenon of catch bonding, where non-covalent bonds become stronger under externally applied forces. The quest to understand the origin of catch-bond behavior has led to the development of phenomenological and microscopic theories that can quantitatively recapitulate experimental data. Here, we assess the successes and limitations of such theories in explaining experimental data. The most widely applied approach is a phenomenological two-state model, which fits all of the available data on a variety of complexes: actomyosin, kinetochore-microtubule, selectin-ligand, and cadherin-catenin binding to filamentous actin. With a primary focus on the selectin family of cell-adhesion complexes, we discuss the positives and negatives of phenomenological models and the importance of evaluating the physical relevance of fitting parameters. We describe a microscopic theory for selectins, which provides a structural basis for catch bonds and predicts a crucial allosteric role for residues Asn82-Glu88.

Using EM tomography of high pressure frozen keratinocytes, we investigated the course of several filaments in a branching of a filament bundle. Moreover we found several putative bifurcations in individual filaments. To verify our observation we also visualized the keratin network in detergent extracted keratinocytes with scanning EM. Here bifurcations of individual filaments could unambiguously be identified additionally to bundle branchings. Interestingly, identical filament bifurcations were also found in purified keratin 8/18 filaments expressed in Escherichia coli which were reassembled in vitro. This excludes that an accessory protein contributes to the branch formation. Measurements of the filament cross sectional areas showed various ratios between the three bifurcation arms. This demonstrates that intermediate filament furcation is very different from actin furcation where an entire new filament is attached to an existing filament. Instead, the architecture of intermediate filament bifurcations is less predetermined and hence consistent with the general concept of IF formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Programmed in the interactions of organic molecules with different precursor species and the fine modulation of the niche environments, a formative elegance is reflected in the biological means for crystal formation in comparison to the synthetic counterparts. In order to spotlight the role of prevalent biophysical environments in the emergence of fascinating materials, we revisit biologically modulated mineralization to describe nucleation and crystallization under physicochemical highly non-ideal conditions on account of macromolecular crowding and the gel-like nature of cellular matrices.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It plays an essential role in pathogen survival during host infection such that the enzymes involved in this cycle have been suggested as potential drug targets against human pathogens. Isocitrate lyase (ICL) catalyzes the first-step reaction of the glyoxylate cycle, using isocitrate from the TCA cycle as the substrate to produce succinate and glyoxylate. In this study we report the crystal structure of Magnaporthe oryzae ICL in both the ligand-free form and as a complex with Mg(2+), glyoxylate, and glycerol, as well as the structure of the Fusarium graminearum ICL complexed with Mn(2+) and malonate. We also describe the ligand-induced conformational changes in the catalytic loop and C-terminal region, both of which are essential for catalysis. Using various mutant ICLs in an activity assay, we gained insight into the function of residues within the active site.

Robust methods to correct for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the electron microscope are necessary for cryoSPT to reach its resolution potential. Many factors can make CTF correction for cryoSPT challenging, such as lack of eucentricity of the specimen stage, inherent low dose per image, specimen charging, beam-induced specimen motions, and defocus gradients resulting both from specimen tilting and from unpredictable ice thickness variations. Current CTF correction methods for cryoET make at least one of the following assumptions: that the defocus at the center of the image is the same across the images of a tiltseries, that the particles all lie at the same Z-height in the embedding ice, and/or that the specimen, the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) grid and/or the carbon support are flat. These experimental conditions are not always met. We have developed a CTF correction algorithm for cryoSPT without making any of the aforementioned assumptions. We also introduce speed and accuracy improvements and a higher degree of automation to the subtomogram averaging algorithms available in EMAN2. Using motion-corrected images of isolated virus particles as a benchmark specimen, recorded with a DE20 direct detection camera, we show that our CTF correction and subtomogram alignment routines can yield subtomogram averages close to 4/5 Nyquist frequency of the detector under our experimental conditions.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Using quantitative estimates of a number of monomers which form the nuclei of amyloid fibrils the sizes of folding nuclei of amyloid fibrils for Aβ40 and 42 have been determined for the first time. We have shown that the size of the primary nucleus of Aβ42 peptide fibrils corresponds to 3 monomers, the size of the secondary nucleus for this peptide is 2 monomers. Applying the same analysis to Aβ40 we conclude that the size of the primary nucleus is 2 monomers, and the size of the secondary nucleus is one monomer. Summation of our theoretical and experimental results has allowed us to propose a new model of the structural organization of amyloid fibrils. Our model suggests that the generation of fibrils takes place along the following simplified pathway: a monomer→a ring oligomer→a mature fibril consisting of ring oligomers. These data shed more light upon our understanding of what sizes of the oligomers could represent main targets for future therapies (tetramers for Aβ42 and trimers for Aβ40), and aid in the development of inhibitors of Aβ40 and 42 oligomer formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While, the osteoinductive compounds are not yet identified. ESM (Ethanol Soluble Matrix), a nacre extract from powder of Pinctada margaritifera pearl oyster shell, has been firstly proven having the capacity to induce mineralization and to restore mineralization defect in vitro. It is suitable to treat ESM as a source of osteoinductive compounds. Herein, we develop a new method for separating and purifying nacre extracts by an ionic approach. At first, cationic ESM (ESMc) and anionic ESM (ESMa) were achieved with ion-exchange resin. Then, ESM was separated and collected on cation exchange HPLC. Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS) was used to reveal the concentrated elements in ESM fractions. A coupled cell models were used to test the ESM fractions. Alizarin Red staining was performed and quantified to evaluate the mineralization level. ESMc and 2 HPLC fractions stimulated the mineralization in both cells. EDS demonstrated the abundant presence of calcium and chloride in the osteogenic fractions. To validate, pure CaCl2 was tested and proven having an osteogenic effect in both cells, but less stable than ESM. The mineralization nodules induced by ESM fractions and CaCl2 differed in both cells. In conclusion, a new method was developed for separating and purifying nacre extracts by an ionic approach.

Reductase domains (R-domains) of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family offer an alternative offloading mechanism by reducing 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PPant) arm-tethered peptidyl chain, a thioester, to an aldehyde or an alcohol. Recent studies have highlighted their functional importance, for instance in the glycopeptidolipid (GPL) biosynthesis of Mycobacterium smegmatis, where the resulting alcoholic group is the site for subsequent modifications such as glycosylations. The mechanistic understanding of how these R-domains function in the context of multi-modular NRPS and PKS is poorly understood. In this study, conformational differences in functionally important loops, not reported previously, were identified in a new crystal form of R-domain which may be relevant to functioning in the context of assembly-line NRPS and PKS enzymology. Here, we propose a concerted loop movement model that allows gating of cofactor binding to these enzymes, enabling the release of the final product only after the substrate has reached the active site during biosynthesis, and therefore distinct from a canonical single domain SDR family of enzymes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Synthetic sequences of n16N, OC-17 and perlucin with signal peptides are produced in a novel Gateway expression system for Dictyostelium under the control of the [ecmB] promoter. A fast and easy scanning electron microscopic screening method was used to differentiate on the colony level between interplay effects of the proteins expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Transformed Dictyostelium, which migrated as multicellular colonies on calcite crystals and left their ECM remnants on the surface were investigated also by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Calcium minerals with and without phosphorous accumulated very frequently within the matrix of the Dictyostelium colonies when grown on calcite. Magnesium containing phosphorous granules were observed when colonies were exposed on silica. The absence of calcium EDX signals in these cases suggests that the external calcite crystals but not living cells represent the major source of calcium in the ECM. Several features of the system provide first evidence that each protein influences the properties of the matrix in a characteristic mode. Colonies transformed with perlucin produced a matrix with cracks on the length scale of a few microns throughout the matrix patch. For colonies with OC-17, almost no cracks were observed, regardless of the length scale. The non-transformed Dictyostelium (Ax3-Orf+) produced larger cracks. The strategy presented here develops the first step toward an efficient eukaryotic screening system for the combinatorial functionalization of materials by bioengineering in close analogy to natural biomineralization concepts.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The function of DNA methylation depends on cell context and is correlated with histone modification patterns. In particular, trimethylation of Lys36 on histone H3 tail (H3K36me3) is associated with DNA methylation and elongation phase of transcription. PWWP domains of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B read this epigenetic mark to guide DNA methylation. Here we report the first crystal structure of the DNMT3B PWWP domain-H3K36me3 complex. Based on this structure, we propose a model of the DNMT3A PWWP domain-H3K36me3 complex and build a model of DNMT3A (PWWP-ADD-CD) in a nucleosomal context. The trimethylated side chain of Lys36 (H3K36me3) is inserted into an aromatic cage similar to the ""Royal"" superfamily domains known to bind methylated histones. A key interaction between trimethylated Lys36 and a conserved water molecule stabilized by Ser270 explains the lack of affinity of mutated DNMT3B (S270P) for the H3K36me3 epigenetic mark in the ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial abnormalities) syndrome.

It has been confirmed in experiment that residue Glu44 will greatly affect the catalytic activity but the mechanism is still unknown. In this study, conventional molecular dynamics, steered molecular dynamics and free energy calculation were integrated to simulate the hydrolysis and product release process to gain insights into the factors that influence catalytic activity. Analysis of simulation results indicated that Glu44 could maintain the proper conformation of its substrate to ensure successful cleavage reaction or serve as a base required in the inverting mechanism in hydrolysis. After hydrolysis is completed, residues Glu44, Asp494, Trp611 and Glu55 participate in hydrogen bond rearrangement during product releasing process. This rearrangement can reduce the sliding barrier and stimulate the product to move toward the exit in the initial release stage. Dependent on the rearrangement, the product moves toward the exit and is exposed to an increasing amount of solvent molecules, which makes solvent effect more and more notable. With the assistance of solvent interaction, product can get rid of the enzyme more easily. However, the subsequent release process remains uncertain because of the disordered motion of solvent molecules.

In this study, we explore the strategies to identify plausible 3D structural models by combining the 2D analysis of such diffraction patterns with computational modeling (normal mode analysis or molecular dynamics simulations). As the first step toward such hybrid modeling, we established a protocol to assess the agreement between the model structure and the target XFEL diffraction pattern and showed that XFEL data can be used to study the conformational transitions of biological molecules. We tested the proposed algorithms using data of three biomolecular complexes of different sizes (elongation factor 2, CCM virus, and ribosome) and examined the experimental conditions that are required to perform such studies, in particular the XFEL beam intensity requirements. The results indicate that the current beam intensity is close to a strength that enables us to study conformational transitions of macromolecules, such as ribosomes.

We analyzed here the interface in NMR ensembles of protein-protein heterodimeric complexes and found it to span a wide range of different conservations. The different exhibited conservations do not simply correlate with the size of the systems/interfaces, and are most probably the result of an interplay between different factors, including the quality of experimental data and the intrinsic complex flexibility. In any case, this information is not to be missed when NMR structures of protein-protein complexes are analyzed; especially considering that, as we also show here, the first NMR conformer is usually not the one which best reflects the overall interface. To quantify the interface conservation and to analyze it, we used an approach originally conceived for the analysis and ranking of ensembles of docking models, which has now been extended to directly deal with NMR ensembles. We propose this approach, based on the conservation of the inter-residue contacts at the interface, both for the analysis of the interface in whole ensembles of NMR complexes and for the possible selection of a single conformer as the best representative of the overall interface.

The modeling of the conserved 34 amino acid residues long central beta-sheet region of Corneous beta-proteins using an ab initio protein folding and structure prediction algorithm indicates that this region is formed by four antiparallel beta-sheets. Molecular dynamic simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) analysis showed that the disposition of polar and apolar amino acids within the beta-region gives rise to an amphipathic core whose stability is further increased, especially in an aqueous environment, by the association into a dimer due to apolar interactions and specific amino-acid interactions. The dimers in turn polymerize into a 3nm thick linear beta-filament due to van der Waals and hydrogen-bond interactions. It is suggested that once this nuclear core of anti-parallel sheets evolved in the genome of a reptilian ancestor of the extant reptiles and birds about 300 millions years ago, new properties emerged in the corneous material forming scales, claws, beaks and feathers in these amniotes based on the tendency of these unique corneous proteins to form stable filaments different from keratin intermediate filaments or sterical structures formed by other corneous proteins so far known.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Chitinase activity was observed in the acetic acid-soluble fraction of the shell and in the buffer extract from the mantle.

Treatment with commercially available chitinase obtained from Trichoderma viride altered the shell microstructure of L. stagnalis.

Though the formation of a coiled coil requires only the presence of suitably spaced hydrophobic residues, sequence specificities have also been associated with specific oligomeric states. RhXXhE is one such sequence motif, associated with parallel trimers, found in coronins and other proteins. Coronin, present in all eukaryotes, is an actin-associated protein involved in regulating actin turnover. Most eukaryotic coronins possess the RhXXhE trimerization motif. However, a unique feature of parasitic kinetoplastid coronin is that the positions of R and E are swapped within their coiled coil domain, but were still expected to form trimers. To understand the role of swapped motif in oligomeric specificity, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of Leishmania donovani coronin coiled coil domain (LdCoroCC) at 2.2Å, which surprisingly, reveals an anti-parallel tetramer assembly. Small angle X-ray scattering studies and chemical crosslinking confirm the tetramer in solution and is consistent with the oligomerization observed in the full length protein. Structural analyses reveal that LdCoroCC possesses an inherent asymmetry, in that one of the helices of the bundle is axially shifted with respect to the other three. The analysis also identifies steric reasons that cause this asymmetry. The bundle adapts an extended a-d-e core packing, the e residue being polar (with an exception) which results in a thermostable bundle with polar and apolar interfaces, unlike the existing a-d-e core antiparallel homotetramers with apolar core. Functional implications of the anti-parallel association in kinetoplastids are discussed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Chemotactic recognition of extracellular signals is mediated by the periplasmic sensing domain of methyl-accepting chemotactic proteins (membrane-embedded receptors). In this work, we report a high-resolution structure of the periplasmic sensing domain of transducer-like protein 1 (Tlp1), an aspartate receptor of C. jejuni. Crystallographic analysis revealed that it contains two Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) subdomains. An acetate and chloride ions (both from the crystallisation buffer) were observed bound to the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal PAS subdomains, respectively. Surprisingly, despite being crystallised in the presence of aspartate, the structure did not show any electron density corresponding to this amino acid. Furthermore, no binding between the sensing domain of Tlp1 and aspartate was detected by microcalorimetric experiments. These structural and biophysical data suggest that Tlp1 does not sense aspartate directly; instead, ligand recognition is likely to occur indirectly via an as yet unidentified periplasmic binding protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This mechanism is essential for parasite development and represents a physiological step used as target for many antimalarial drugs; nevertheless, the fine mechanisms underlying these processes in Plasmodium species are still under discussion. Here, we studied the events of hemoglobin uptake and hemozoin nucleation in the different stages of the intraerythrocytic cycle of the murine malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi using transmission electron tomography of cryofixed and freeze-substituted cells. The results showed that hemoglobin uptake in P. chabaudi starts at the early ring stage and is present in all developmental stages, including the schizont stage. Hemozoin nucleation occurs near the membrane of small food vacuoles. At the trophozoite stage, food vacuoles are found closely localized to cytostomal tubes and mitochondria, whereas in the schizont stage, we observed a large food vacuole located in the central portion of the parasite. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms of hemoglobin uptake and degradation in rodent malaria parasites.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A putative mechanism of Auranofin action proposes that monovalent gold, Au(I), released from the drug, can bind to the redox-active dithiol group of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Au(I) binding in the active site is expected to prevent electron transfer to the downstream substrate thioredoxin (Trx), thus interfering with redox homeostasis in the parasite. To clarify the molecular mechanism of Auranofin action in more detail, we determined a series of atomic resolution X-ray structures for E. histolytica thioredoxin (EhTrx) and thioredoxin reductase (EhTrxR), the latter with and without Auranofin. Only the disulfide-bonded form of the active site dithiol (Cys(140)-Cys(143)) was invariably observed in crystals of EhTrxR in spite of the addition of reductants in various crystallization trials, and no gold was found associated with these cysteines. Non-catalytic Cys(286) was identified as the only site of modification, but further mutagenesis studies using the C286Q mutant demonstrated that this site was not responsible for inhibition of EhTrxR by Auranofin. Interestingly, we obtained both of the catalytically-relevant conformations of this bacterial-like, low molecular weight TrxR in crystals without requiring an engineered disulfide linkage between Cys mutants of TrxR and Trx (as was originally done with Escherichia coli TrxR and Trx). We note that the -CXXC- catalytic motif, even if reduced, would likely not provide space sufficient to bind Au(I) by both cysteines of the dithiol group.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

CETP inhibition raises plasma levels of HDL cholesterol; a ternary tunnel complex with CETP bridging HDL and LDL was suggested as a mechanism. Here, we test whether the inhibition of CETP tunnel complex formation is a promising approach to suppress CE transfer from HDL to LDL, for potential treatment of cardio-vascular disease (CVD). Three monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of CETP are assayed for their potential to interfere with CE transfer between HDL and/or LDL. Surprisingly, antibodies that target the tips of the elongated CETP molecule, interaction sites sterically required to form the suggested transfer complexes, do not interfere with CETP activity, but an antibody binding to the central region does. We show that CETP interacts with HDL, but not with LDL. Our findings demonstrate that a ternary tunnel complex is not the mechanistic prerequisite to transfer CE among lipoproteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

FlgD guides and controls the polymerization of FlgE that builds the hook, a short curved and hollow cylinder that connects the flagellar basal body spanning the cell envelope to the protruding filament. Crystal structures of truncated forms of Helicobacter pylori FlgD from two different strains in two space groups, I422 and P2, are reported here, at 2.2Å and 2.8Å resolution, respectively.

The protein by itself appears to have little impact on the size of the nucleoids as determined by fluorescent microscopy. However, it has a significant impact on the nucleoidal collapse by PEG. This is quantitatively explained by assuming the H-NS protein enhances the effective diameter of the DNA helix leading to an increase in the depletion forces induced by the PEG. Ultimately, however, the free energy of the nucleoid itself turns out to be independent of the H-NS concentration. This is because the enhancement of the supercoil excluded volume is negligible.

Here, we present the crystal structures of IS in apo state and in complex with NADP(+)/8-oxogeranial, exhibiting an active center that lacks the classical Tyr/Lys/Ser triad spatially conserved in SDRs, with only the catalytically critical function of triad tyrosine remained in Tyr178. In consistent, mutation of Tyr178 to a phenylalanine residue significantly abolished the catalytic activity of IS. Within the substrate binding pocket, the linear-shaped 8-oxogeranial adopts an entirely extended conformation with its two aldehyde ends hydrogen-bonded to Tyr178-OH and Ser349-OH, respectively. In addition, the intermediate carbon chain of bound substrate is harbored by a well-ordered hydrophobic scaffold, involving residues Ile145, Phe149, Leu203, Met213, Phe342, Ile345 and Leu352. Mutagenesis studies showed that both Ser349 and the hydrophobic residues around are determinant to the substrate specificity and, consequently, the catalytic activity of IS. In contrast, the Gly150-Pro160 loop previously proposed as a factor involved in substrate binding might have very limited contribution, because the deletion of residues Ile151-His161 has only slight influence on the catalytic activity.

These receptors are expressed on the surface of immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. An inhibitory receptor, FcγRIIb, is expressed on macrophages and other myeloid leukocytes simultaneously with the activating receptor FcγRIIa, thereby setting a threshold for cell activation. The affinity of IgG Fc for binding activating Fc receptors depends on IgG subclass and the composition of N-linked glycans attached to a conserved asparagine in the Fc CH2 domain. For example, Fc regions with afucosylated glycans bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa than fucosylated Fc, and afucosylated Fcs exhibit enhanced ADCC activity in vivo and in vitro. Enhanced pro-inflammatory responses have also been seen for Fc regions with amino acid substitutions. GASDALIE Fc is an Fc mutant (G236A/S239D/A330L/I332E) that exhibits a higher affinity for FcγRIIIa and increased effector functions in vivo compared to wild-type Fc.

The final result of the study is the numerical value of a set of parameters: molecular mass, volume and radius of gyration, average electron density and second moment of the electron density fluctuations inside the particles. It is also shown that in the complex the centres of gravity of CFTR and of the detergent are displaced relative to each other.

The distance distribution function, P(r) confirms that the WT-CFTR is elongated and with an inhomogeneous electronic density. The F508del-CFTR molecule is also elongated (maximum diameter ∼13.2nm), but the associated detergent micelle hides a larger surface, plausibly related to an increased exposure of hydrophobic portions of the mutated protein. The corresponding P(r) is consistent with the presence of well defined domains, probably linked by flexible regions.

Understanding biomineralization pathways in foraminifera is particularly important because their calcitic shells are major components of global calcium carbonate production. We introduce here a novel correlative approach combining cryo-SEM, cryo-fluorescence imaging and cryo-EDS. This approach is applied to the study of ion transport processes in the benthic foraminifer genus Amphistegina. We confirm the presence of large sea water vacuoles previously identified in intact and partially decalcified Amphistegina lobifera specimens. We observed relatively small vesicles that were labelled strongly with calcein, and also identified magnesium (Mg)-rich mineral particles in the cytoplasm, as well as in the large sea water vacuoles. The combination of cryo-microscopy with elemental microanalysis and fluorescence imaging reveals new aspects of the biomineralization pathway in foraminifera which are, to date, unique in the world of biomineralization. This approach is equally applicable to the study of biomineralization pathways in other organisms.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In particular, at higher concentrations they are responsible for sepsis and the septic shock syndrome associated with high lethality. Since most data are indicative that LPS aggregates are the bioactive units, their supramolecular structures are considered to be of outmost relevance for deciphering the molecular mechanisms of its bioactivity. So far, however, most of the data available addressing this issue, were published only for the lipid part (lipid A) and the core-oligosaccharide containing rough LPS, representing the bioactive unit. By contrast, it is well known that most of the LPS specimen identified in natural habitats contain the smooth-form (S-form) LPS, which carry additionally a high-molecular polysaccharide (O-chain). To fill this lacuna and going into a more natural system, here various wild-type (smooth form) LPS including also some LPS fractions were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron radiation to analyze their aggregate structure. Furthermore, the influence of a recently designed synthetic anti-LPS peptide (SALP) Pep19-2.5 on the aggregate structure, on the binding thermodynamics, and on the cytokine-inducing activity of LPS were characterized, showing defined aggregate changes, high affinity binding and inhibition of cytokine secretion. The data obtained are suitable to refine our view on the preferences of LPS for non-lamellar structures, representing the highest bioactive forms which can be significantly influenced by the binding with neutralizing peptides such as Pep19-2.5.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

There are two major species of Aβ in the brain: Aβ42 and Aβ40. Although Aβ40 is several-fold more abundant than Aβ42 in soluble form, Aβ42 is the major component of amyloid plaques. Structural knowledge of Aβ42 fibrils is important both for understanding the process of Aβ aggregation and for designing fibril-targeting drugs. Here we report site-specific structural information of Aβ42 fibrils at 22 residue positions based on electron paramagnetic resonance data. In combination with structure prediction program Rosetta, we modeled Aβ42 fibril structure at atomic resolution. Our Aβ42 fibril model consists of four parallel in-register β-sheets: βN (residues ∼7-13), β1 (residues ∼17-20), β2 (residues ∼32-36), and βC (residues 39-41). The region of β1-loop-β2 in Aβ42 fibrils adopts similar structure as that in Aβ40 fibrils. This is consistent with our cross seeding data that Aβ42 fibril seeds shortened the lag phase of Aβ40 fibrillization. On the other hand, Aβ42 fibrils contain a C-terminal β-arc-β motif with a special turn, termed ""arc"", at residues 37-38, which is absent in Aβ40 fibrils. Our results can explain both the higher aggregation propensity of Aβ42 and the importance of Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

It is widespread and particularly endemic in the developing world. Here we present a detailed structural study by 3-D negative staining and cryo-electron tomography of a unique Giardia organelle, the ventral disc. The disc is composed of a regular array of microtubules and associated sheets, called microribbons that form a large spiral, held together by a myriad of mostly unknown associated proteins. In a previous study we analyzed by cryo-electron tomography the central microtubule portion (here called disc body) of the ventral disc and found a large portion of microtubule associated inner (MIPs) and outer proteins (MAPs) that render these microtubules hyper-stable. With this follow-up study we expanded our 3-D analysis to different parts of the disc such as the ventral and dorsal areas of the overlap zone, as well as the outer disc margin. There are intrinsic location-specific characteristics in the composition of microtubule-associated proteins between these regions, as well as large differences between the overall architecture of microtubules and microribbons. The lateral packing of microtubule-microribbon complexes varies substantially, and closer packing often comes with contracted lateral tethers that seem to hold the disc together. It appears that the marginal microtubule-microribbon complexes function as outer, laterally contractible lids that may help the cell to clamp onto the intestinal microvilli. Furthermore, we analyzed length, quantity, curvature and distribution between different zones of the disc, which we found to differ from previous publications.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Mechanisms of spicule formation have been intensively studied due to the high ecological importance of sponges and their interest to materials science. Light and electron microscopy are not appropriate enough to display the process from silicon-enriched cells to mature spicules because of composite structure of the sponge tissues. In this article, spiculogenesis in the siliceous sponge has been studied for the first time with the use of fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescent vital dye NBD-N2 was applied to stain growing siliceous structures in the sponge and primmorph cell system. The main stages of spicule growth in the fresh-water sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis (Pallas, 1773) were visualized: silicon accumulation in sclerocytes; formation of an organic filament protruding from the cell; further elongation of the filament and growth of the spicule in a spindle-like form with enlargement in the center; merger with new sclerocytes and formation of the mature spicule. Fluorescent microscopy combined with SEM allows us to overcome the virtual differentiation between intra- and extracellular mechanisms of spicule growth. The growing spicule can capture silicic acid from the extracellular space and merge with new silicon-enriched cells. Visualization of the growing spicules with the fluorescent dye allows us to monitor sponge viability in ecological or toxicological experiments and to apply genomic, proteomic and biochemical techniques.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The tectorial membrane (TM) is a gelatinous acellular membrane located above the hearing sensory epithelium and is composed mostly of type II collagen, and α and β tectorins. TM molecules self-assemble in the endolymph fluid environment, interacting medially with the spiral limbus and distally with the outer hair cell stereocilia. Here, we used immunogold labeling in freeze-substituted mouse cochleae to assess the fine localization of both tectorins in distinct TM regions. We observed that the TM adheres to the spiral limbus through a dense thin matrix enriched in α- and β-tectorin, both likely bound to the membranes of interdental cells. Freeze-etching images revealed that type II collagen fibrils were crosslinked by short thin filaments (4±1.5nm, width), resembling another collagen type protein, or chains of globular elements (15±3.2nm, diameter). Gold-particles for both tectorins also localized adjacent to the type II collagen fibrils, suggesting that these globules might be composed essentially of α- and β-tectorins. Finally, the presence of gold-particles at the TM lower side suggests that the outer hair cell stereocilia membrane has a molecular partner to tectorins, probably stereocilin, allowing the physical connection between the TM and the organ of Corti.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Such SMFS studies and, more generally, the diverse applications of AFM across biophysics and nanotechnology are improved by enhancing data quality via improved force stability, force precision, and temporal resolution. For an advanced, small-format commercial AFM, we illustrate how these three metrics are limited by the cantilever itself rather than the larger microscope structure, and then describe three increasingly sophisticated cantilever modifications that yield enhanced data quality. First, sub-pN force precision and stability over a broad bandwidth (Δf=0.01-20Hz) is routinely achieved by removing a long (L=100μm) cantilever's gold coating. Next, this sub-pN bandwidth is extended by a factor of ∼50 to span five decades of bandwidth (Δf=0.01-1000Hz) by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to modify a shorter (L=40μm) cantilever. Finally, FIB-modifying an ultrashort (L=9μm) cantilever improves its force stability and precision while maintaining 1-μs temporal resolution. These modified ultrashort cantilevers have a reduced quality factor (Q≈0.5) and therefore do not apply a substantial (30-90pN), high-frequency force modulation to the molecule, a phenomenon that is unaccounted for in traditional SMFS analysis. Currently, there is no perfect cantilever for all applications.

LT2 belongs to the tetracycline repressor family, one of the largest groups of bacterial transcription factors. The crystal structure of dimeric AcrR was determined and refined to 1.56Å resolution. The tertiary and quaternary structures of AcrR are similar to those of its homologs. The multidrug binding site was identified based on structural alignment with homologous proteins and has a di(hydroxyethyl)ether molecule bound. Residues from helices α4 and α7 shape the entry into this binding site. The structure of AcrR reveals that the extended helical conformation of helix α4 is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between Glu67 (helix α4) and Gln130 (helix α7). Based on the structural comparison with the closest homolog structure, the Escherichia coli AcrR, we propose that this hydrogen bond is responsible for control of the loop-to-helix transition within helix α4. This local conformational switch of helix α4 may be a key step in accessing the multidrug binding site and securing ligands at the binding site.

Unfortunately, the ligand is often found in ambiguous electron density that is difficult to interpret. The ligand validation statistics suggest over-interpretation, even for the most active compounds like diflunisal. The primary technical reason is its position on a crystallographic 2-fold axis in the most common crystal form. Further investigations with the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to crystallize TTR complexes have resulted in a new trigonal polymorph with two tetramers in the asymmetric unit. The ligand used to obtain this new polymorph, 4-hydroxychalcone, is related to curcumin.

This largely stems from the fact that techniques used to investigate a given (bio)mineral should ideally be married with techniques that provide insight into the biological mechanisms that form that mineral (and vice versa). We observe two broad challenges that inhibit a fluent exchange of ideas and information between mineralogists/materials scientists and biologists. First, the smorgasbord of emerging and rapidly evolving techniques available to mineralogists and biologists alike make it difficult not only for an expert to remain contemporary, but can be bewildering to the non-expert. Second, to truly integrate and relate a specific biological insight into the genesis of a biomineral, with the effect that insight has on the properties of the mineral itself, is not trivial. We propose that an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) approach can not only address this challenge, it can also provide deep insight into how the rich diversity of metazoan mineralised structures evolved. While an evo-devo approach to biomineralogy has previously been employed by some groups, recent exciting methodological developments available to the molecular biologist now make this strategy even more attractive. In this short review we aim to outline our perception of the role that evo-devo can play within the field of biomineralogy, taking as a case study the past achievements, recent insights and some future research directions associated with gastropod shell formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The monomer structure of Rv2258c consists of two domains which are linked by a long α-helix. The N-terminal domain is essential for dimerization and the C-terminal domain has the Class I MTase fold.

Here, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to visualize the entire structures of P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and to examine their morphological and volumetric changes at different stages. During developmental stages, the parasite forms Maurer's clefts and vesicles in the iRBC cytoplasm and knobs on the iRBC surface, and extensively remodels the iRBC structure for proliferation of the parasite. In our observations, the Maurer's clefts and vesicles in the P. falciparum-iRBCs, resembling the so-called tubovesicular network (TVN), were not connected to each other, and continuous membrane networks were not observed between the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and the iRBC cytoplasmic membrane. In the volumetric analysis, the iRBC volume initially increased and then decreased to the end of the blood stage cycle. This suggests that it is necessary to absorb a substantial amount of nutrients from outside the iRBC during the initial stage, but to release waste materials from inside the iRBC at the multinucleate stage. Transportation of the materials may be through the iRBC membrane, rather than a special structure formed by the parasite, because there is no direct connection between the iRBC membrane and the parasite. These results provide new insights as to how the malaria parasite grows in the iRBC and remodels iRBC structure during developmental stages; these observation can serve as a baseline for further experiments on the effects of therapeutic agents on malaria.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite numerous studies of the cytolytic mechanism of PLY, little structural information on its interactions with a specific receptor of the cell membrane is available. We report here the first crystal structures of PLY in an apo-form and in a ternary complex with two mannoses at 2.8Å and 2.5Å resolutions, respectively. Both structures contained one monomer in an asymmetric unit and were comprised of four discontinuous domains, similar to CDC structures reported previously. The ternary complex structure showed that loop 3 and the undecapeptide region in domain 4 might contribute to cellular recognition by binding to mannose, as a component of a specific cell-surface receptor. Moreover, mutational studies and docking simulations for four residues (Leu431, Trp433, Thr459, and Leu460) in domain 4 indicated that Leu431 and Trp433 in the undecapeptide might be involved in the binding of cholesterol, together with the Thr459-Leu460 pair in loop 1. Our results provide structure-based molecular insights into the interaction of PLY with the target cell membrane, including the binding of mannose and cholesterol.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The physical properties of this exoskeleton envelope are adapted to the function and the eco-physiological requirements of the species. This paper aimed to study, using the TEM, the structure of the tubercle and the tergite cuticle of the arid species Hemilepistus reaumurii in a comparison with a subhumid isopod in order to relate some peculiar features to an adaptive process to environmental constraints. Results showed that wild H. reaumurii cuticles were twice as thick in comparison with Porcellio variabilis which is a subhumid zone isopod. It is suggested therefore that the thick cuticle of wild H. reaumurii can be an adaptation to terrestrial life and a protection against osmotic stress and water loss in an arid environment. In addition the inside of the tubercle showed a high number of lipid droplets stacked into an adipose tissue which suggest that tubercles were used for storage for nutritive material in wild H. reaumurii.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Each GEF acts on a small subset of the G-proteins only, thus providing signalling selectivity. Rlf is a GEF with selectivity for the G-proteins RalA and RalB. Here the crystal structure of Rlf in complex with Ral is determined. The Rlf·Ral complex crystallised into two different crystal forms, which represent different steps of the exchange reaction. Thereby general insight in the CDC25-HD catalysed nucleotide exchange is obtained. In addition, the basis for the selectivity of the interaction is investigated.

In mammals, the regulatory (R) subunit localises the catalytic (C) subunit to specific subcellular sites through the interaction of its N-terminal homodimeric docking and dimerization (D/D) domain with specific scaffold proteins. The structure of the D/D domain has been extensively studied in mammals, but there is little information from non-mammalian species. In this work, we present the structural analysis of the D/D domain of Bcy1, the R subunit of PKA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using chemical crosslinking experiments and static light scattering measurements we found that this R subunit forms a tetramer in solution, unlike its dimeric mammalian counterparts. We determined that the D/D domain is responsible for this unusual oligomeric state. Using biophysical techniques including size-exclusion chromatography, sucrose gradient sedimentation, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and circular dichroism, we performed a detailed structural characterization of the tetrameric D/D domain of Bcy1. We used homology modelling in combination with computer-aided docking methods and ab initio SAXS modelling methods to develop structural models for the D/D domain tetramer. The models consist of two homodimers with a canonical D/D domain fold that generate a dimer of dimers with novel putative interaction surfaces. These findings indicate that the oligomerization states of PKA R subunits is more diverse than previously thought, and suggest that this might allow some forms of PKA to interact with a wide range of intracellular partners.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Measurements were carried out on pristine chitin crystals stabilized by proteins and water, as well as after their deproteinization and dehydration. We found substantial shifts (up to Δq/q=9% in the wave vector in q-space) in the (020) diffraction peak position between intact and purified chitin samples. However, chitin lattice parameters extracted from the set of reflections (hkl), which did not contain the (020)-reflection, showed no systematic variation between the pristine and the processed samples. The observed shifts in the (020) peak position are discussed in terms of the ordering-induced modulation of the protein and water electron density near the surface of the ultra-thin chitin fibrils due to strong protein/chitin and water/chitin interactions. The extracted modulation periods can be used as a quantitative parameter characterizing the interaction length.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We present optical measurements of the elastic properties of Tethya aurantia and Euplectella aspergillum marine sponge spicules using non-invasive Brillouin and Raman laser light scattering, thus probing the hierarchical structure on two very different scales. On the scale of single bonds, as probed by Raman scattering, the spicules resemble a combination of pure silica and mixed organic content. On the mesoscopic scale probed by Brillouin scattering, we show that while some properties (Young's moduli, shear moduli, one of the anisotropic Poisson ratios and refractive index) are nearly the same as those of artificial optical fiber, other properties (uniaxial moduli, bulk modulus and a distinctive anisotropic Poisson ratio) are significantly smaller. Thus this natural composite of largely isotropic materials yields anisotropic elastic properties on the mesoscale. We show that the spicules' optical waveguide properties lead to pronounced spontaneous Brillouin backscattering, a process related to the stimulated Brillouin backscattering process well known in artificial glass fibers. These measurements provide a clearer picture of the interplay of flexibility, strength, and material microstructure for future functional biomimicry.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Its main virulence factor is an extracellular polysaccharide capsule whose structure, assembly and dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we apply improved protocols for sample preparation and recently-developed scanning microscopy techniques to visualize the ultrastructure of the C. neoformans capsule at high-resolution (up to 1 nm) and improved structural preservation. Although most capsule structures in nature consist of linear polymers, we show here that the C. neoformans capsule is a 'microgel-like' structure composed of branched polysaccharides. Moreover, we imaged the capsule-to-cell wall link, which is formed by thin fibers that branch out of thicker capsule filaments, and have one end firmly embedded in the cell wall structure. Together, our findings provide compelling ultrastructural evidence for a branched and complex capsule conformation, which may have important implications for the biological activity of the capsule as a virulence factor.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The key structural feature suggesting PR-10 functionality is a huge hydrophobic cavity created in the protein interior by a scaffold composed of an extended β-sheet wrapped around a long and flexible C-terminal α-helix. Several crystallographic and NMR studies have shown that the cavity can accommodate a variety of small molecule ligands, including phytohormones. The article describes ∼1.3 Å resolution crystal structures of a Lupinus luteus PR-10 isoform LlPR-10.1A, in its free form and in complex with trans-zeatin, a naturally occurring plant hormone belonging to the cytokinin group. Moreover we present the structure of the same protein where the saturation with zeatin is not complete. This set of three crystal structures allows us to track the structural adaptation of the protein upon trans-zeatin docking, as well as the sequence of the ligand-binding events, step-by-step. In addition, titration of LlPR-10.1A with trans-zeatin monitored in solution by CD spectra, confirmed the pattern of structural adaptations deduced from the crystallographic studies. The ligand-biding mode shows no similarity to other zeatin complexes of PR-10 proteins. The present work, which describes the first atomic models of the same PR-10 protein with and without a physiological ligand, reveals that the conformation of LlPR-10.1A undergoes a significant structural rearrangement upon trans-zeatin binding.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The main target of Gctf is to maximize the cross-correlation of a simulated CTF with the logarithmic amplitude spectra (LAS) of observed micrographs after background subtraction. Novel approaches in Gctf improve both speed and accuracy. In addition to GPU acceleration (e.g. 10–50×), a fast ‘1-dimensional search plus 2-dimensional refinement (1S2R)’ procedure further speeds up Gctf. Based on the global CTF determination, the local defocus for each particle and for single frames of movies is accurately refined, which improves CTF parameters of all particles for subsequent image processing. Novel diagnosis method using equiphase averaging (EPA) and self-consistency verification procedures have also been implemented in the program for practical use, especially for aims of near-atomic reconstruction.

Near-atomic resolution has been obtained for several well-ordered filaments. However, it is still a challenge to achieve high resolution for filaments with flexible subunits and a large axial rise per subunit relative to pixel size. Here, we describe an approach that improves the resolution in such cases. In filaments with a large axial rise, many segments must be shifted a long distance along the filament axis to match with a reference projection, potentially causing loss of alignment accuracy and hence resolution. In our study of myosin filaments, we overcame this problem by pre-determining the axial positions of myosin head crowns within segments to decrease the alignment error. In addition, homogeneous, well-ordered segments were selected from the raw data set by checking the assigned azimuthal rotation angle of segments in each filament against those expected for perfect helical symmetry. These procedures improved the resolution of the filament reconstruction from 30 Å to 13 Å. This approach could be useful in other helical filaments with a large axial rise and/or flexible subunits.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The Alkyl hydroperoxide Reductase (AhpR) system, composed of the AhpC and AhpF proteins, is one of the dominant antioxidant defense systems required for scavenging hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxide. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the mechanism of the AhpR ensemble formation. In previous studies, we were able to elucidate conformational flexibility of Escherichia coli AhpF during the catalytic cycle and its binding site, the N-terminal domain (NTD), to AhpC. We proposed the novel binding and release mechanism of EcAhpC-AhpF, which is mediated by the well defined redox-state linked conformational changes associated with the C-terminal tail and active site regions of EcAhpC. Here, we have proceeded further to elucidate the solution structure of E. coli AhpC and the stable ensemble formation with EcAhpF using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The EcAhpC-AhpF complex structure with a stoichiometry of AhpC10:AhpF2 reveals that dimeric EcAhpF in its extended conformation enables the NTD disulphide centers to come in close proximity to the redox-active disulphide centers of EcAhpC, and provides an efficient electron transfer. Furthermore, the significance of the C-terminal tail of EcAhpC in ensemble formation is elucidated.

To investigate the proteolytic core of the ClpXP1/P2 protease from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus we have used a non-denaturing mass spectrometry approach. We show that the proteolytic core is a double ring tetradecamer consisting of an equal number of ClpP1 and ClpP2 subunits with masses of 21.70 and 23.44 kDa, respectively. Two stoichiometries are revealed for the heptameric rings: 4ClpP1 + 3ClpP2 and 3ClpP1 + 4ClpP2. When combined in the double ring the stoichiometries are (4ClpP1 + 3ClpP2) + (3ClpP1 + 4ClpP2) and 2 × (3ClpP1 + 4ClpP2) with a low population of a 2 × (4ClpP1 + 3ClpP2) tetradecamer. The assignment of the stoichiometries is confirmed by collision-induced dissociation of selected charge states of the intact heptamer and tetradecamer. Presence of the heterodimers, heterotetramers and heterohexamers, and absence of the mono-oligomers, in the mass spectra of the partially denatured protease indicates that the ring complex consists of a chain of ClpP1/ClpP2 heterodimers with the ring completed by an additional ClpP1 or ClpP2 subunit.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A set of helix interactions exclusive to either inactive or active/intermediate states were identified. The analysis of these interactions distinguished some local conformational changes involved in receptor activation, in particular, a packing between the intracellular domains of transmembrane helices H3 and H7 and a separation between those of H2 and H6. Also, differential movements of the extracellular and intracellular domains of these helices are apparent. Moreover, a segment of residues in helix H3, including residues L/I3.40 to L3.43, is identified as a key component of the activation mechanism, acting as a conformational hinge between extracellular and intracellular regions. Remarkably, the influence on the activation process of some glutamic and aspartic acidic residues and, as a consequence, the influence of variations on local pH is highlighted.

Sufficient numbers of equatorial and meridional reflections were collected to define the axial projection of the base of the unit cell in fibers drawn from the contents of the silk glands, and to suggest that the axial period is different from that suggested by Rudall and coworkers.

The results showed that erythrocyte shrinkage, annexin-V binding to externalized PS on the membrane of early-stage apoptotic cells, the increased membrane roughness and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, as well as the change of distributions of band 3 protein in RBCs. Compared with the control RBCs, as the concentration of t-BHP up to 0.1mM, the membrane roughness of G6PD deficient RBCs showed significant difference (p<0.05) and as the concentration of t-BHP up to 0.3mM, externalized PS showed significant difference (p<0.05). Furthermore, the population types of RBCs showed dramatic difference between control groups and G6PD deficient groups. Oxidative stress induced more serious erythrocyte apoptosis and resulted in increased roughness of erythrocyte membrane and abnormal distributed band 3 protein in G6PD deficient RBCs.

For this goal, molecules were extracted from nacre (ESM, Ethanol Soluble Matrix) and tested on osteoblasts of the subchondral bone from OA patients undergoing total knee replacement and on MC3T3 cells for comparison. We chose to investigate the mineralization with Alizarin Red staining and with the study of extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and composition. In a complementary way the structure of the ECM secreted during the mineralization phase was investigated using second harmonic generation (SHG). Nacre extract was able to induce the early presence (after 7 days) of precipitated calcium in cells. Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy showed the presence of nanograins of an early crystalline form of calcium phosphate in OA osteoblasts ECM and hydroxyapatite in MC3T3 ECM. SHG collagen fibers signal was present in both cell types but lower for OA osteoblasts. In conclusion, nacre extract was able to rapidly restore the mineralization capacity of osteoarthritis osteoblasts, therefore confirming the potential of nacre as a source of osteogenic compounds.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we determined three crystal structures of mTDH: wild-type (WT) in the apo form; in complex with NAD(+) and a substrate analog, glycerol, or with only NAD(+); as well as the R180K variant with NAD(+). This is the first description of a structure for mammalian SDR-type TDH. Structural comparison revealed the structural basis for SDR-type TDH catalysis remains strictly conserved in bacteria and mammals. Kinetic enzyme assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements indicated the R180K mutation has little effect on NAD(+) binding affinity, whereas affects the substrate's affinity for the enzyme. The crystal structure of R180K with NAD(+), biochemical and spectroscopic studies suggested that the R180K mutant should bind NAD(+) in a similar way and have a similar folding to the WT. However, the R180K variant may have difficulty adopting the closed form due to reduced interaction of residue 180 with a loop which connects a key position for mTDH switching between the closed and open forms in mTDH catalysis, and thereby exhibited a significantly decreased kcat/Km value toward the substrate, L-Thr. In sum, our results suggest that activity of GalE-like TDH can be regulated by remote interaction, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction around the Arg180 of mTDH.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Recently, YmdB was reported to be capable of deacetylating O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) to yield ADPr and free acetate. To study the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism, the crystal structures of E. coli YmdB in complex with ADPr, double mutant N25AD35A complexed with 2'-OAADPr, and Y126A/ADPr complex were solved at 1.8Å, 2.8Å and 3.0Å resolution, respectively. Structural and biochemical studies reveal that YmdB has substrate specificity against 2'-OAADPr. The conserved residues Asn25 and Asp35 are crucial for catalytic activity, and an active water molecule is proposed as the nucleophile to attack the acetyl group of 2'-OAADPr. Our findings indicate that the conserved phenyl group of Tyr126 plays a crucial role in catalytic activity by stabilizing the right orientation of distal ribose and that Gly32 may be important for activity by interacting with the acetyl group of 2'-OAADPr. Based on these observations, a model of YmdB in complex with 2'-OAADPr was made to illustrate the proposed catalytic mechanism of YmdB.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This study analyzes the spatially varying shape of individual ganoid scales as a structural element in a biological system, the exoskeleton of the armored fish Polypterus senegalus (bichir). X-ray microcomputed tomography is used to generate digital 3D reconstructions of the mineralized scales. Landmark-based geometric morphometrics is used to measure the geometric variation among scales and to define a set of geometric parameters to describe shape variation. A formalism using continuum mechanical strain analysis is developed to quantify the spatial geometry change of the scales and illustrate the mechanisms of shape morphing between scales. Five scale geometry variants are defined (average, anterior, tail, ventral, and pectoral fin) and their functional implications are discussed in terms of the interscale mobility mechanisms that enable flexibility within the exoskeleton. The results suggest that shape variation in materials design, inspired by structural biological materials, can allow for tunable behavior in flexible composites made of segmented scale assemblies to achieve enhanced user mobility, custom fit, and flexibility around joints for a variety of protective applications.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The gold-standard and frequency-limited approaches to single-particle refinement were each independently used to determine orientation parameters for the final reconstruction. Both approaches showed similar resolution curves and nominal resolution values for the 60S dataset, estimated at 2.9 Å. The amount of over-fitting present during frequency-limited refinement was quantitatively analyzed using the high-resolution phase-randomization test, and the results showed no apparent over-fitting. The number of asymmetric subunits required to reach specific resolutions was subsequently analyzed by refining subsets of the data in an ab initio manner. With our data collection and processing strategies, sub-nanometer resolution was obtained with ∼200 asymmetric subunits (or, equivalently for the ribosomal subunit, particles). Resolutions of 5.6 Å, 4.5 Å, and 3.8 Å were reached with ∼1000, ∼1600, and ∼5000 asymmetric subunits, respectively. At these resolutions, one would expect to detect alpha-helical pitch, separation of beta-strands, and separation of Cα atoms, respectively.

We developed a robust solution to adapt cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) to a monolayer of adherent cells using a functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel growing substrate. We applied this method to reconstitute an endothelial cell monolayer to visualize the morphology of adherens junctions (AJs) which regulate permeability and integrity of the vascular barrier. The fine morphology and ultrastructure of AJs from cultured primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) were analyzed in their native state by using CEMOVIS. Doxycycline and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are known as efficient regulators of endothelial permeability. Doxycycline and S1P treatments both led to a drastic morphological switch from very uneven to standardized 14-17 nm wide AJs over several microns indicative of a better membrane tethering. Repetitive structures were occasionally noticed within the AJ cleft reflecting a local improved structural organization of VE-cadherin molecules. The ultrastructural stabilization of AJs observed upon treatment likely indicates a better adhesion and thus provides structural clues on the mechanism by which these treatments improve the endothelial barrier function. This method was also successfully extended to a thick epithelial barrier model.

There is an unusual conformation in the ANK4 repeat that is stabilized by Trp-404, and the structure reveals a solvent exposed ankyrin groove. Domain orientations of the three copies within the asymmetric unit suggest a stable interaction between KRIT1 ARD and FERM domains, indicating a globular ARD-FERM module.

The building blocks of keratin IFs are parallel coiled-coil dimers of two distinct sequence-related proteins distinguished as type I and type II keratins. To gain more insight into their structural dynamics, we resorted to hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry of keratins K8 and K18, which are characteristic for simple epithelial cells. Using this powerful technique not employed with IFs before, we mapped patterns of protected versus unprotected regions in keratin complexes at various assembly levels. In particular, we localized protein segments exhibiting different hydrogen exchange patterns in tetramers versus filaments. We observed a general pattern of precisely positioned regions of stability intertwining with flexible regions, mostly represented by the non-α-helical segments. Notably, some regions within the coiled-coil domains are significantly more dynamic than others, while the IF-consensus motifs at the end domains of the central α-helical ""rod"" segment, which mediate the ""head-to-tail"" dimer-dimer interaction in the filament elongation process, become distinctly more protected upon formation of filaments. Moreover, to gain more insight into the dynamics of the individual keratins, we investigated the properties of homomeric preparations of K8 and K18. The physiological importance of keratins without a partner is encountered in both pathological and experimental situations when one of the two species is present in robust excess or completely absent, such as in gene-targeted mice.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Simulations were performed by varying system size, temperature and starting configuration. Peptides dispersed randomly in the simulation box come together early on in the simulation and form aggregates. These aggregates are dynamic implying the absence of stabilizing interactions. This facilitates the exploration of alternate arrangements. The constituent peptides sample a variety of conformations, frequently re-orient and re-arrange with respect to each other and dissociate from/re-associate with the aggregate. The size and lifetime of aggregates vary depending upon the number of inter-peptide backbone H-bonds. Most of the aggregates formed are amorphous but crystalline aggregates of smaller size (mainly 2-mers) do appear and sustain for varying durations of time. The peptides in crystalline 2-mers are mostly anti-parallel. The largest crystalline aggregate that appears is a 4-mer in a single sheet and a 4-, 5-, or 6-mer in double layered arrangement.

Using a combination of 2D and 3D microscopy techniques coupled with amino acid analysis and X-ray scattering, we reveal the working components of M. crenulata’s radula. It is characterized by numerous marginal teeth surrounding a pair of major hook-like lateral teeth, two pairs of minor lateral teeth and a large central tooth. The mature major lateral teeth show pronounced signs of wear, which gradually increase towards the very front end of the radula and are evidence for scraping. An abrupt change in the amino acid composition in the major lateral teeth and the concurrent formation of a chitinous fiber-network mark the onset of tooth maturation.

Specifically, the emergence of subtomogram averaging has increased the demand for batch processing during tomographic reconstruction; fully automatic fiducial marker-based alignment is the main technique in this process. However, the lack of an accurate method for detecting and tracking fiducial markers precludes fully automatic alignment. In this paper, we present a novel, fully automatic alignment scheme for ET. Our scheme has two main contributions: First, we present a series of algorithms to ensure a high recognition rate and precise localization during the detection of fiducial markers. Our proposed solution reduces fiducial marker detection to a sampling and classification problem and further introduces an algorithm to solve the parameter dependence of marker diameter and marker number. Second, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the tracking of fiducial markers by reducing the tracking problem to an incomplete point set registration problem. Because a global optimization of a point set registration occurs, the result of our tracking is independent of the initial image position in the tilt series, allowing for the robust tracking of fiducial markers without pre-alignment. The experimental results indicate that our method can achieve an accurate tracking, almost identical to the current best one in IMOD with half automatic scheme. Furthermore, our scheme is fully automatic, depends on fewer parameters (only requires a gross value of the marker diameter) and does not require any manual interaction, providing the possibility of automatic batch processing of electron tomographic reconstruction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Some important sample parameters, such as thickness and tilt, are needed for 3-D reconstruction. However, these parameters can currently only be determined using trial 3-D reconstructions. Accurate electron mean free path plays a significant role in modeling image formation process essential for simulation of electron microscopy images and model-based iterative 3-D reconstruction methods; however, their values are voltage and sample dependent and have only been experimentally measured for a limited number of sample conditions. Here, we report a computational method, tomoThickness, based on the Beer-Lambert law, to simultaneously determine the sample thickness, tilt and electron inelastic mean free path by solving an overdetermined nonlinear least square optimization problem utilizing the strong constraints of tilt relationships. The method has been extensively tested with both stained and cryo datasets. The fitted electron mean free paths are consistent with reported experimental measurements. The accurate thickness estimation eliminates the need for a generous assignment of Z-dimension size of the tomogram. Interestingly, we have also found that nearly all samples are a few degrees tilted relative to the electron beam. Compensation of the intrinsic sample tilt can result in horizontal structure and reduced Z-dimension of tomograms.

Here we use in vivo calcein labeling and confocal Raman spectroscopy, as well as cryo-FIB-SEM 3D structural reconstructions, to investigate the processes occurring in the internal cavity of the embryo, the blastocoel. We demonstrate that calcein stained granules are also present in the filopodial network within the blastocoel. Simultaneous fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy show that these granules do contain a calcium mineral. By tracking the movements of these granules, we show that the granules in the epithelium and primary mesenchymal cells barely move, but those in the filopodial network move long distances. We could however not detect any unidirectional movement of the filopodial granules. We also show the presence of mineral containing multivesicular vesicles that also move in the filopodial network. We conclude that the filopodial network is an integral part of the mineral transport process, and possibly also for sequestering calcium and other ions. Although much of the sequestered calcium is deposited in the mineralized skeleton, a significant amount is used for other purposes, and this may be temporarily stored in these membrane-delineated intracellular deposits.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

However, the achievable resolution may limit the ability to do so, especially when small or flexible complexes are under study. In such cases, protein labeling has emerged as an important complementary tool to characterize domain architecture and elucidate functional mechanistic details.

We investigated the tubular system of intact, living mouse skeletal muscle fibers using 2PFM and the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4 dissolved in the external solution or the membrane dye di-8-ANEPPS. We simultaneously measured the SHG signal from the myosin filaments of the skeletal muscle fibers. We found that at least a subset of the YMs observed in SHG images are closely juxtaposed with Y-shaped structures of the transverse tubules (YTs). The distances of corresponding YMs and YTs yield values between 1.3 μm and 4.1 μm including pixel uncertainty with a mean distance of 2.52±0.10 μm (S.E.M., n=41). Additionally, we observed that some of the linear-shaped areas in the tubular system are colocalized with linear-shaped areas in the SHG images.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The structural similarity between α- and β-tubulin makes it difficult to computationally distinguish them in the noisy cryo-EM images, unless a marker protein for the tubulin dimer, such as kinesin motor domain, is present. We have developed a new data processing protocol that can accurately determine αβ-tubulin register and seam location for MT segments. Our strategy can deal with difficult situations, where the marker protein is relatively small or the decoration of marker protein is sparse. Using this new seam-search protocol, combined with movie processing for data from a direct electron detection camera, we were able to determine the cryo-EM structures of MT at 3.5 Å resolution in different functional states. The successful distinction of α- and β-tubulin allowed us to visualize the nucleotide state at the E-site and the configuration of lateral contacts at the seam.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The pyoluteorin biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 encodes the halogenase PltA, which has been previously demonstrated to perform both chlorinations in vitro. PltA selectively accepts as a substrate a pyrrole moiety covalently tethered to a nonribosomal peptide thiolation domain PltL (pyrrolyl-S-PltL) for FAD-dependent di-chlorination, yielding 4,5-dichloropyrrolyl-S-PltL. We report a 2.75 Å-resolution crystal structure of PltA in complex with FAD and chloride. PltA is a dimeric enzyme, containing a flavin-binding fold conserved in flavin-dependent halogenases and monooxygenases, and an additional unique helical region at the C-terminus. This C-terminal region blocks a putative substrate-binding cleft, suggesting that a conformational change involving repositioning of this region is necessary to allow binding of the pyrrolyl-S-PltL substrate for its dichlorination by PltA.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Multiscale numerical geometry strategies in the Situs package and in secondary structure detection software are currently evolving due to the recent increases in cryo-EM resolution. Criteria that aim to predict the accuracy of fitted atomic models at low (worse than 8Å) and medium (4-8 Å) resolutions remain challenging. However, a high level of confidence in atomic models can be achieved by combining such criteria. The observed errors are due to map-model discrepancies and due to the effect of imperfect global docking strategies. Extending the earlier motion capture approach developed for flexible fitting, we use simulated fiducials (pseudoatoms) at varying levels of coarse-graining to track the local drift of structural features. We compare three tracking approaches: naïve vector quantization, a smoothly deformable model, and a tessellation of the structure into rigid Voronoi cells, which are fitted using a multi-fragment refinement approach. The lowest error is an upper bound for the (small) discrepancy between the crystal structure and the EM map due to different conditions in their structure determination. When internal features such as secondary structures are visible in medium-resolution EM maps, it is possible to extend the idea of point-based fiducials to more complex geometric representations such as helical axes, strands, and skeletons. We propose quantitative strategies to assess map-model pairs when such secondary structure patterns are prominent.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Although LRH-1 is able to bind phospholipids, it is still considered an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) with an unknown regulatory hormone. Our prior cellular and structural studies demonstrated that the signaling phosphatidylinositols PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2) and PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) bind and regulate SF-1 (Steroidogenic Factor-1, NR5A1), a close homolog of LRH-1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of human LRH-1 ligand binding domain (LBD) bound by PIP3 - the first phospholipid with a head group endogenous to mammals. We show that the phospholipid hormone binds LRH-1 with high affinity, stabilizing the receptor LBD. While the hydrophobic PIP3 tails (C16/C16) are buried inside the LRH-1 ligand binding pocket, the negatively charged PIP3 head group is presented on the receptor surface, similar to the phosphatidylinositol binding mode observed in the PIP3-SF-1 structure. Thus, data presented in this work reinforce our earlier findings demonstrating that signaling phosphatidylinositols regulate the NR5A receptors LRH-1 and SF-1.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Moreover, it is secreted by the intracellular parasite Leishmania to modulate the host response. These functions make NDK an attractive target for drug design and for studies aiming at a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating host-pathogen interactions.

Although P95S and Δ5Ct variants conserve the hexameric structure of the wild-type protein, the double mutant becomes a dimer as shown by in solution studies. Free energy calculation of dimer-dimer interfaces and enzymatic assays indicate that P95S, Δ5Ct and P100S/Δ5Ct mutations progressively decrease the hexamer stability and enzyme activity.

Despite this knowledge, the exact molecular mechanisms triggering the contractile dysfunction remain unknown. Here, we aimed to unravel these. Hence, we used a transgenic mouse model expressing a well-described D286G mutant skeletal muscle α-actin protein and recapitulating the human condition of contractile deregulation and severe skeletal muscle weakness. We then recorded and analyzed the small-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of isolated membrane-permeabilized myofibers. Results showed that upon addition of Ca(2+), the intensity changes of the second (1/19 nm(-1)) and sixth (1/5.9 nm(-1)) actin layer lines and of the first myosin meridional reflection (1/14.3 nm(-1)) were disrupted when the thin-thick filament overlap was optimal (sarcomere length of 2.5-2.6 μm). However these reflections were normal when the thin and thick filaments were not interacting (sarcomere length>3.6 μm). These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the replacement of just one amino acid in the skeletal muscle α-actin protein partly prevents actin conformational changes during activation, disrupting the strong binding of myosin molecules. This leads to a limited myosin-related tropomyosin movement over the thin filaments, further affecting the amount of cross-bridges, explaining the contractile dysfunction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Though the exact function of the isolated CAP domain remains ambiguous, several functions, including the binding of cholesterol, lipids and heparan sulfate, have been recently attributed to different CAP domain proteins. In this study, the bacterial CAP domain structure was analyzed and compared with the previously solved crystal structures of representative CAPs, and the function of BB0689 was examined.

In this study, we presented the crystal structure of hCBR1 in complex with GSH, in the absence of its substrates or inhibitors. Interestingly, we found that the GSH molecule presents in a configuration quite different from that was previously reported when substrate is binding to hCBR1. Our structure indicates that GSH contributes to the substrate selectivity of hCBR1 and protects the catalytic center of hCBR1 through a switch-like mechanism. The isothermal titration calorimetry and enzymology data shows that GSH directly binding with hCBR1 when there's no substrate exist.

FleQ belongs to the NtrC subfamily of response regulators, but lacks the corresponding aspartic acid for phosphorylation in the REC domain (FleQ(R), also named FleQ domain). Here, we show that the atypical REC domain of FleQ is essential for the function of FleQ. Crystal structure of FleQ(R) at 2.3Å reveals that the structure of FleQ(R) is significantly different from the REC domain of NtrC1 which regulates gene expression in a phosphorylation dependent manner. FleQ(R) forms a novel active dimer (transverse dimer), and mediates the dimerization of full-length FleQ in an unusual manner.

The spore coat consists of more than seventy different proteins, arranged into at least four distinct structural layers: the undercoat, inner coat, outer coat and crust. However, how these proteins, especially the morphogenetic proteins, interact to establish the organized, functional coat layers remains poorly understood. CotY and CotZ as the components of the crust, play a morphogenetic role in the crust assembly around the spore. In this study, the single molecule force spectroscopy was used to investigate the interaction and dynamics between CotY and CotZ at the single-molecule level. The results show that homotypic interactions of CotY and CotZ and the heterotypic interaction between CotY and CotZ exist. Furthermore, the dissociation kinetics of the complexes were studied by monitoring the relationship between the unbinding forces and the loading rates at different pulling velocities.

Toward identification of the capsid determinants for these properties, the structure of AAVrh.8 was determined by X-ray crystallography to 3.5 Å resolution and compared to those of other AAV isolates. The capsid viral protein (VP) structure consists of an αA helix and an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel core conserved in parvoviruses, and large insertion loop regions between the β-strands form the capsid surface topology. The AAVrh.8 capsid exhibits the surface topology conserved in all AAVs: depressions at the icosahedral twofold axis and surrounding the cylindrical channel at the fivefold axis, and three protrusions around the threefold axis. A structural comparison to serotypes AAV2, AAV8, and AAV9, to which AAVrh.8 shares ∼ 84%, ∼ 91%, and ∼ 87% VP sequence identity, respectively, revealed differences in the surface loops known to affect receptor binding, transduction efficiency, and antigenicity. Consistent with this observation, biochemical assays showed that AAVrh.8 is unable to bind heparin and does not cross-react with conformational monoclonal antibodies and human donor serum directed against the other AAVs compared. This structure of AAVrh.8 thus identified capsid surface differences which can serve as template regions for rational design of vectors with enhanced transduction for specific tissues and escape pre-existing antibody recognition.

In the original formulation the mask typically used in these applications had to be separated into a working and a testing area. Here we present a variant of the calculation of the M-free score, which under certain conditions does not require adapting the mask used during the processing. This is made possible by a modified algorithm that allows for arbitrary variances in the testing and in the working area. Consequently, the reference bias can be estimated with knowledge of only the starting reference, the final average and the mask used for processing. We show that the new formulation of the M-free score gives a reliable measure of the reference bias for any sub-tomogram average that has ancillary data, such as when the averaged structure contains density in the periphery, when a complex is attached to a membrane (membrane-associated complexes) or when one subunit is attached to others (e.g. in viruses). Further, we show that in contrast to correlation-based measurements, the M-free score is sensitive to wrong-alignments and contaminations present in the data set. The scope of this new calculation of the M-free score is to reduce the constraints of the previous approach and in certain cases to avoid an adaptation of the mask.

The Hk1/Rrp1 two-component system (TCS) in Borrelia burgdorferi consists of a hybrid histidine kinase and a response regulator with diguanylate cyclase activity, respectively. Phosphorylated Rrp1 catalyzes the synthesis of c-di-GMP, a second messenger associated with bacterial life-style control networks. Spirochetes lacking either Hk1 or Rrp1 are virulent in mice but destroyed within feeding ticks. Activation of Hk1 by exogenous stimuli represents the seminal event for c-di-GMP signaling. We reasoned that structural characterization of Hk1's sensor would provide insights into the mechanism underlying signal transduction and aid in the identification of activating ligands. The Hk1 sensor is composed of three ligand-binding domains (D1-3), each with homology to periplasmic solute-binding proteins (PBPs) typically associated with ABC transporters. Herein, we determined the structure for D1, the most N-terminal PBP domain. As expected, D1 displays a bilobed Venus Fly Trap-fold. Similar to the prototypical sensor PBPs HK29S from Geobacter sulfurreducens and VFT2 from Bordetella pertussis, apo-D1 adopts a closed conformation. Using complementary approaches, including SAXS, we established that D1 forms a dimer in solution. The D1 structure enabled us to model the D2 and D3 domains. Differences in the ligand-binding pockets suggest that each PBP recognizes a different ligand. The ability of Hk1 to recognize multiple stimuli provides spirochetes with a means of distinguishing between the acquisition and transmission blood meals and generate a graded output response that is reflective of the perceived environmental threats.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In order to contribute to the understanding of strain differentiation, we have determined the crystal structures of the globular, folded domains of four prion proteins (cow, deer, elk and Syrian hamster) bound to the POM1 antibody fragment Fab. Although the overall structural folds of the mammalian prion proteins remains extremely similar, there are several local structural variations observed in the misfolding-initiator motifs.

Circumferential collagen molecules feature orientational disorder and are oriented up and down in random manner showing acceptor or donor groups at the surface of cementum. Considering that the cementum continues to grow in thickness throughout life, we can conclude that the cementum is growing circumferentially in two opposite directions and radially in one direction. A Markov chain type model for polarity formation in the direction of growth predicts D-groups preferably appearing at the fiber front.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The detailed catalytic mechanism of these enzymes, including the identity of the general base, is not fully understood. We determined a series of crystal structures of the PPiase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb PPiase) bound to catalytic metals, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi; the reaction substrate) and to one or two inorganic phosphate ions (Pi; the reaction product), ranging in resolution from 1.85 to 3.30Å. These structures represent a set of major kinetic intermediates in the catalytic turnover pathway for this enzyme and suggest an order of association and dissociation of the divalent metals, the substrate and the two products during the catalytic turnover. The active site of Mtb PPiase exhibits significant structural differences from the well characterized Escherichia coli PPiase in the vicinity of the bound PPi substrate. Prompted by these differences, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) analysis yielded an atomic description of the hydrolysis step for Mtb PPiase and, unexpectedly, indicated that Asp89, rather than Asp54 that was proposed for E. coli PPiase, can abstract a proton from a water molecule to activate it for a nucleophilic attack on the PPi substrate. Mutagenesis studies of the key Asp residues of Mtb PPiase supported this mechanism. This combination of structural and computational analyses clarifies our understanding of the mechanism of family I PPiases and has potential utility for rational development of drugs targeting this enzyme.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition to an improved camera detective quantum efficiency, acquisition of DDD movies allows for correction of movement of the specimen, due to both instabilities in the microscope specimen stage and electron beam-induced movement. Unlike specimen stage drift, beam-induced movement is not always homogeneous within an image. Local correlation in the trajectories of nearby particles suggests that beam-induced motion is due to deformation of the ice layer. Algorithms have already been described that can correct movement for large regions of frames and for >1 MDa protein particles. Another algorithm allows individual <1 MDa protein particle trajectories to be estimated, but requires rolling averages to be calculated from frames and fits linear trajectories for particles. Here we describe an algorithm that allows for individual <1 MDa particle images to be aligned without frame averaging or linear trajectories. The algorithm maximizes the overall correlation of the shifted frames with the sum of the shifted frames. The optimum in this single objective function is found efficiently by making use of analytically calculated derivatives of the function. To smooth estimates of particle trajectories, rapid changes in particle positions between frames are penalized in the objective function and weighted averaging of nearby trajectories ensures local correlation in trajectories. This individual particle motion correction, in combination with weighting of Fourier components to account for increasing radiation damage in later frames, can be used to improve 3-D maps from single particle cryo-EM.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We present high resolution crystal structures of polyhedra for seven previously uncharacterised types of cypoviruses, four using ab initio selenomethionine phasing (two of these required over 100 selenomethionine crystals each). Approximately 80% of residues are structurally equivalent between all polyhedrins (pairwise rmsd ⩽1.5 Å), whilst pairwise sequence identities, based on structural alignment, are as little as 12%. These structures illustrate the effect of 400 million years of evolution on a system where the crystal lattice is the functionally conserved feature in the face of massive sequence variability. The conservation of crystal contacts is maintained across most of the molecular surface, except for a dispensable virus recognition domain. By spreading the contacts over so much of the protein surface the lattice remains robust in the face of many individual changes. Overall these unusual structural constraints seem to have skewed the molecule’s evolution so that surface residues are almost as conserved as the internal residues.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Whether this sclereid formation is force-triggered remains open so far. In fruit peduncles of several Malus species as modified plant stems, for example, the persistent fibre ring is displaced to the centre by formation of cortex parenchyma during growth. Parenchyma cells subsequently differentiate into an additional layer of brachysclereids, previously interpreted as an adaptation to continuously rising fruit loads. The present study pursues a multi-scale numerical modelling approach, to verify the important effect for different cellular architectures in both sclerenchyma categories on the stiffness of these tissues and the entire peduncle. First, different material properties are simulated analogue to plant tissues on the basis of three cell types. A regular three-dimensional and a random Voronoi microstructure combined with various mechanical cell wall parameters are applied. Using homogenisation simulations based on HILL's principle, numerical calculations predict a lower effective homogenised tissue stiffness of isodiametric brachysclereids compared to those of fibres, confirming experimentally obtained data from Malus fruit peduncles. Furthermore, a curved peduncle model with a complex arrangement of different material layers is generated. Diverse material sets are tested under three representative loadings, using an adaptive diffuse domain approach (AMDiS). The model explains the function of sclereids as considerable contributors to the stiffness against bending and tensile deformations, as well as torsion, especially in consequence of superimposed load conditions in the case of a curved plant stem.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we describe the biochemical, kinetic and structural characterization of GCHII from Helicobacter pylori (hGCHII). The crystal structure of hGCHII, unlike other GCHII structures, revealed that cysteines at the active site existed in oxidized state forming two disulfide bonds and lacked Zn(2+) that was shown to be indispensable for catalytic activity in other species. However, incubation of hGCHII with hydrogen peroxide, an oxidizing agent, followed by PAR-assay showed that Zn(2+) was intrinsically present, indicating that all cysteines at the catalytic site remained in reduced state. Moreover, site directed mutagenesis of catalytic site cysteines revealed that only three, out of four cysteines were essential for hGCHII activity. These results, though, indicated that hGCHII crystallized in oxidized form, the expulsion of Zn(2+) upon oxidation of catalytic cysteines revealed its ability to act in response to the redox environment. Exploring further, incubation of hGCHII with reversible thiol modifying agent S-methyl-methane-thiosulfonate resulted in loss of GCHII activity due to oxidation of its cysteine residues as revealed by mass spectrometry studies. However, addition of reducing agent DTT partially restored the hGCHII catalytic activity.

Normally, the hCC monomer, a low molecular type 2 Cystatin, consists of 120 amino acid residues and functions as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases. The oligomerization of hCC is involved in the pathophysiology of a rare form of amyloidosis namely Icelandic hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy, in which an L68Q mutant is deposited as amyloid in brain arteries of young adults.

Predictions by AMYLPRED, an amyloidogenic determinant prediction algorithm developed in our lab, led us to synthesize and experimentally study two additional predicted peptides derived from hCC. Along with our previous findings, in this work, we reveal that these peptides self-assemble, in a similar way, into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro, as electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy and Congo red staining studies have shown.

Recently it has been shown that cryo-focused ion beam milling of plunge-frozen eukaryotic cells can produce homogeneously thin, distortion free lamellas for cryo-electron tomography. Multicellular organisms and tissue cannot be properly vitrified and thinned using this technique because they are considerably thicker. High pressure freezing is therefore necessary to provide optimal preservation.

A computational de-fringing method has been proposed, but it has not been widely employed, perhaps because the importance of de-fringing has not been clearly demonstrated. For testing purposes, we employed Zernike phase-plate imaging in a cryo-electron tomographic study of radial-spoke complexes attached to microtubule doublets. We found that the contrast enhancement by ZPP imaging made nonlinear denoising insensitive to the filtering parameters, such that simple low-frequency band-pass filtering made the same improvement in map quality. We employed sub-tomogram averaging, which compensates for the effect of the ""missing wedge"" and considerably improves map quality. We found that fringes (caused by the abrupt cut-on of the central hole in the phase plate) can lead to incorrect representation of a structure that is well-known from the literature.

In these proteins, in addition to the α-helices involved in dimerization, inter-subunit contacts are strengthened by additional C-terminal β-strands. Using sequence and structure analysis we show that these β-strands constitute a novel segment-swapped zinc ribbon domain. We detect the presence of the zinc ribbon domain in MarR proteins from many bacterial homologs. While the metal-chelating residues of the zinc ribbons are absent in most members of this family, we could however identify several species of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes that possess intact zinc-chelating sites. Conservation pattern of metal-chelating residues together with the extensive structural resemblance to zinc ribbons, in particular to the bridge-region of the dsDNA break repair protein Ku, suggests that the C-terminal β-rich region of these proteins is a zinc ribbon. Sequence analysis also supports a distant evolutionary connection between the zinc ribbons of the MarR and Ku families.

Individual wool follicles were dissected into four portions designated as the bulb, elongation, keratogenous and keratinisation portions. Gel-free proteomic analysis of dissected portions from 30 follicles showed that the first keratins to appear were K31, K35 and K85, in the bulb portion. The first epithelial KAP, trichohyalin, was detected in the bulb portion and the first cortical KAP, KAP11.1 was found in the elongation portion. Other major trichocyte keratins and cortical KAPs began to appear further up the follicle in the keratogenous and keratinisation zones. These results were consistent with what has been observed from gene expression studies and correlated well with the morphological changes observed in the follicle. Other proteins detected by this approach included the keratin anchor protein desmoplakin, as well as vimentin and epithelial keratins, histones, ribosomal proteins and collagens. Two-dimensional electrophoretic (2DE) analysis of dissected portions of 50 follicles revealed substantial changes in the position, number and intensity of the spots of the trichocyte keratins as they progressed through the follicle zones, suggesting that they are subject to modification as a result of the keratinisation process.

Selecting 2D class averages of particle images generally improves the accuracy and efficiency of the reference-free 3D angle estimation, but causes an insufficient angular sampling to fill the information of the target object in the 3D frequency space. Similarly, the initial 3D structure by the random-conical tilt reconstruction has the well-known ""missing cone"" artifact. Here, we attempted to solve the limited angular sampling problem by sequentially applying maximum a posteriori estimate with expectation maximization algorithm (sMAP-EM). Using both simulated and experimental cryo-electron microscope images, the sMAP-EM was compared to the direct Fourier method on the basis of reconstruction error and resolution. To establish selection criteria of the final regularization weight for the sMAP-EM, the effects of noise level and sampling sparseness on the reconstructions were examined with evenly distributed sampling simulations. The frequency information filled in the missing cone of the conical tilt sampling simulations was assessed by developing new quantitative measurements. All the results of visual and numerical evaluations showed the sMAP-EM performed better than the direct Fourier method, regardless of the sampling method, noise level, and sampling sparseness. Furthermore, the frequency domain analysis demonstrated that the sMAP-EM can fill the meaningful information in the unmeasured angular space without detailed a priori knowledge of the objects.

In addition, the DNA binding cleft of DrEndoIII3 seems to be less accessible for DNA interactions, while in DrEndoIII1 it seems to be more open. Analysis of the enzyme activities shows that DrEndoIII2 is most similar to the previously studied enzymes, while DrEndoIII1 seems to be more distant with a weaker activity towards substrate DNA containing either thymine glycol or an abasic site. DrEndoIII3 is the most distantly related enzyme and displays no detectable activity towards these substrates even though the suggested catalytic residues are conserved.

Mechanistic insight into MuB function is limited to its AAA+ ATPase module, which upon ATP binding assembles into helical filaments around the DNA. However, the structure and function of the flexible N-terminal domain (NTD) appended to the AAA+ module remains uncharacterized. Here we report the solution structure of MuB NTD determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals a compact domain formed by four α-helices connected by short loops, and confirms the presence of a helix-turn-helix motif. High structural similarity and sequence homology with λ repressor-like DNA-binding domains suggest a possible role of MuB NTD in DNA binding. We also demonstrate that the NTD directly mediates the ability of MuB to establish filament-filament interactions. These findings lead us to a model in which the NTD interacts with the AAA+ spirals and perhaps also with the DNA bound within the filament, favoring MuB polymerization and filament clustering. We propose that the MuB NTD-dependent filament interactions might be an effective mechanism to bridge distant DNA regions during Mu transposition.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Using this approach, a set of 15-mer aptamers for cytochrome P450 51A1 was designed using docking and molecular dynamics simulation.

A rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by beta-glucosidase (BG) enzymes, which convert cellulobiose into two glucose molecules. The activity of these enzymes has been shown to vary with solution pH. However, it is not well understood how pH influences the enzyme conformation required for catalytic action on the substrate. A structural understanding of this pH effect is important for predicting shifts in BG activity in bioreactors and environmental matrices, in addition to informing targeted protein engineering. Here we applied molecular dynamics simulations to explore conformational and substrate binding dynamics in two well-characterized BGs of bacterial (Clostridium cellulovorans) and fungal (Trichoderma reesei) origins as a function of pH. The enzymes were simulated in an explicit solvated environment, with NaCl as electrolytes, at their prominent ionization states obtained at pH 5, 6, 7, and 7.5. Our findings indicated that pH-dependent changes in the ionization states of non-catalytic residues localized outside of the immediate active site led to pH-dependent disruption of the active site conformation. This disruption interferes with favorable H-bonding interactions with catalytic residues required to initiate catalysis on the substrate. We also identified specific non-catalytic residues that are involved in stabilizing the substrate at the optimal pH for enzyme activity. The simulations further revealed the dynamics of water-bridging interactions both outside and inside the substrate binding cleft during structural changes in the enzyme-substrate complex. These findings provide new structural insights into the pH-dependent substrate binding specificity in BGs.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Among them, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch are notable for their pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and certain types of cancer. The hydrolysis process occurring inside the hydrophobic lipid bilayer remains unclear. With the aim to understand the mechanism of intramembrane proteolysis by γ-secretase, we constructed a homology model of human PS1 and performed molecular dynamics simulation in explicit membrane phospholipids with different components. During the simulation, TM9 was found to exhibit a high level of flexibility that involved in ""gate-open"" movement of TM2 and TM6, and thus partially exposed the catalytic residues. The highly conserved PALP motif acts as an anchor to mediate the conformation changes of TM6 induced by TM9. Moreover, direct interactions were observed between 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and the active site of γ-secretase, indicating that the lipid molecules have the potential to modulate γ-secretase by contacting with the catalytic residues, i.e., ASP 257 and ASP 385 of PS1. The intermediate states indicate a potential substrate penetration pathway through the interface of TM2 and TM6, which may be induced by changes of TM9. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular simulation study that reveals dynamic behavior of the human PS1 structure in the lipid bilayer and provides insight into the substrate entry path for subsequent intramembrane hydrolysis, which is critical information required for new strategy development of γ-secretase modulators to alleviate devastating AD.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their dimeric configuration is a quaternary substructure of the classical tetrameric avidins which lacks the requirement of the critical Trp that defines the tetramer and dictates the tenacious interaction with biotin. Hoefavidin, derived from the bacterium Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43(T), is the third characterized member of the dimeric avidin subfamily. Like the other members of this group, hoefavidin is a thermostable protein that contains a disulfide bridge between Cys57 and Cys88, thereby connecting and stabilizing the L3,4 and L5,6 loops. This represents a distinctive characteristic of dimeric avidins that compensates for the lack of Trp and enables their dimeric configuration. The X-ray structure of the intact hoefavidin revealed unique crystal packing generated by an octameric cylindrical structure wherein the C-termini segments of each monomer is introduced into the entrance of the biotin-binding site of an adjacent non-canonical monomer. This anomaly in the protein structure served as a lead toward the design of specific binding peptides. We screened for specific hoefavidin binding peptides derived from the C-terminal region and two peptides were obtained that bind a truncated form of hoefavidin (lacking the last 10 amino acids) with dissociation constants of 10(-5)M. The crystal structure of short hoefavidin complexed with a C-terminal derived peptide revealed the mode of binding.

Rspo proteins act by cross-linking members of two cell surface receptor families, complexing the stem cell markers LGR4-6 with the Frizzled-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3/RNF43. The consequent internalisation of the ternary LGR–Rspo–E3 complex removes the E3 ligase activity, which otherwise targets the Wnt receptor Frizzled for degradation, and thus enhances Wnt signalling. Multiple combinations of LGR4-6, Rspo1-4 and ZNRF3/RNF43 are possible, implying the existence of generic interaction determinants, but also of specific differences in complex architecture and activity. We present here a high resolution crystal structure of an ectodomain variant of human LGR5 (hLGR5ecto) complexed with a signalling competent fragment of mouse Rspo2 (mRspo2Fu1-Fu2). The structure shows that the particularly potent Rspo2 ligand engages LGR5 in a fashion almost identical to that reported for hRSPO1. Comparison of our hLGR5ecto structure with previously published structures highlights a surprising plasticity of the LGR ectodomains, characterised by a nearly 9° or larger rotation of the N-terminal half of the horseshoe-like fold relative to the C-terminal half. We also report a low resolution hLGR5–mRspo2Fu1-Fu2–mZNRF3ecto ternary complex structure.

Here, it is shown that structurally converted low molecular weight oligomers can act as nuclei. Further, it could be determined that specifically potassium and phosphate ions strongly influence both nucleus formation as well as fibril growth. Nucleation of fibril assembly could be surpassed by seeding soluble protein with pre-assembled fibrils but also, unexpectedly, with eADF4(C16) sub-micrometer particles.

While the resistance of spores is very well documented, underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we show, by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections and particular resin thin section electron microscopy, that dormant Bacillus spores possess highly ordered crystalline core structures, which contain the DNA, but only if small acid soluble proteins (SASPs) are present. We found those core structures in spores of all Bacillus species investigated, including spores of anthrax. Similar core structures were detected in Geobacillus and Clostridium species which suggest that highly ordered, at least partially crystalline core regions represent a general feature of bacterial endospores. The crystalline core structures disintegrate in a period during spore germination, when resistance against most stresses is lost. Our results suggest that the DNA is tightly packed into a crystalline nucleoid by binding SASPs, which stabilizes DNA fibrils and protects them against modification. Thus, the crystalline nucleoid seems to be the structural and functional correlate for the remarkable stability of the DNA in bacterial endospores.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The new findings concern the following morphology features: (i) at the tip we could identify thin silica layers, which overgrow as a tongue-like feature the front face of the AC and completely fuse during the subsequent growth state. This basically differs from the radial growth of the surrounding lamellar zone of the spicules made of alternating silica lamellae and organic interlayers. (ii) A newly detected disturbed cylindrical zone in the central region of the AC (diameter about 30 μm) contains vertical and horizontal cavities, channels and agglomerates, which can be interpreted as permanent leftover of a formerly open axial channel, later filled by silica. (iii) The AF consists of a three-dimensional crystal-like arrangement of organic molecules and amorphous silica surrounding these molecules.

However, to approach bone growth variations is not an easy task, and many aspects related with histological transformations during ontogeny remain unresolved. In the present study, we conduct a holistic approach using different techniques (polarized microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction) to examine the histomorphological and histochemical variations in the cortical bone of sheep specimens from intrauterine to adult stages, using environmentally controlled specimens from the same species. Our results suggest that during sheep bone development, the most important morphological (shape and size) and chemical transformations in the cortical bone occur during the first weeks of life; synchronized but dissimilar variations are established in the forelimb and hind limb cortical bone; and the patterns of bone tissue maturation in both extremities are differentiated in the adult stage.

Cryo-EM data analysis requires electron microscope images of randomly oriented ice-embedded protein particles to be rotated and translated to allow for coherent averaging when calculating three-dimensional (3D) structures. Rotation of 2D images is usually done with the assumption that the magnification of the electron microscope is the same in all directions. However, due to electron optical aberrations, this condition is not met with some electron microscopes when used with the settings necessary for cryo-EM with a direct detector device (DDD) camera. Correction of images by linear interpolation in real space has allowed high-resolution structures to be calculated from cryo-EM images for symmetric particles. Here we describe and compare a simple real space method, a simple Fourier space method, and a somewhat more sophisticated Fourier space method to correct images for a measured anisotropy in magnification. Further, anisotropic magnification causes contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters estimated from image power spectra to have an apparent systematic astigmatism. To address this problem we develop an approach to adjust CTF parameters measured from distorted images so that they can be used with corrected images. The effect of anisotropic magnification on CTF parameters provides a simple way of detecting magnification anisotropy in cryo-EM datasets.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The extracellular domain of CD44 comprises the hyaluronate-binding domain (HABD) and the membrane-proximal stem region; the short intracellular portion interacts with adaptor proteins and triggers signaling pathways. Binding of hyaluronate to CD44 HABD induces an allosteric conformational change, which results in CD44 shedding. A poorly characterized epitope in human CD44 HABD is recognized by the murine monoclonal antibody MEM-85, which cross-blocks hyaluronate binding to CD44 and also induces CD44 shedding. MEM-85 is of therapeutic interest, as it inhibits growth of lung cancer cells in murine models. In this work, we employed a combination of biophysical methods to determine the MEM-85 binding epitope in CD44 HABD and to provide detailed insight into the mechanism of MEM-85 action. In particular, we constructed a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of MEM-85 as a tool for detailed characterization of the CD44 HABD-antibody complex and identified residues within CD44 HABD involved in the interaction with scFv MEM-85 by NMR spectroscopy and mutational analysis. In addition, we built a rigid body model of the CD44 HABD-scFv MEM-85 complex using a low-resolution structure obtained by small-angle X-ray scattering. The MEM-85 epitope is situated in the C-terminal part of CD44 HABD, rather than the hyaluronate-binding groove, and the binding of MEM-85 induces a structural reorganization similar to that induced by hyaluronate. Therefore, the mechanism of MEM-85 cross-blocking of hyaluronate binding is likely of an allosteric, relay-like nature.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Since the external cuticle acts as an impermeable barrier for most dyes and molecular tools for labeling copepod proteins with fluorescent tags are not available, imaging cellular organelles in these organisms requires label free microscopy. Complementary nonlinear microscopy techniques have been used to investigate the structure and the response of their myofibrils to abrupt changes of temperature or/and salinity. In contrast with previous observations in vertebrates and invertebrates, the flavin autofluorescence which is a signature of mitochondria activity and the Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) pattern assigned to T-tubules overlapped along myofibrils with the second harmonic generation (SHG) striated pattern generated by myosin tails in sarcomeric A bands. Temperature jumps from 18 to 4 °C or salinity jumps from 30 to 15 psu mostly affected flavin autofluorescence. Severe salinity jumps from 30 to 0 psu dismantled myofibril organization with major changes both in the SHG and CARS patterns. After a double stress (from 18 °C/30 psu to 4° C/0 psu) condensed and distended regions appeared within single myofibrils, with flavin autofluorescence bands located between sarcomeric A bands. These results shed light on the interactions between the different functional compartments which provide fast acting excitation-contraction coupling and adequate power supply in copepods muscles.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The biochemical and morphological characteristics of apoptosis including cellular volume decrease, cell membrane blebbing, and phosphatidylserine translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane are considered important events for phagocyte detection. Despite its importance, the relationship between the biological and morphological changes in a living cell has remained controversial. Scanning ion conductance microscopy is a suitable technique for investigating a series of these changes, because it allows us to observe the morphology of living cells without any mechanical interactions between the probe and the sample surface with a high resolution. Here, we investigated the biochemical and morphological changes in single neurons during the early stages of apoptosis, including apoptotic volume decrease, membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine translocation, by using scanning ion conductance microscopy. Time-course imaging of apoptotic neurons showed there was a reduction in apoptotic volume after exposure to staurosporine and subsequent membrane bleb formation, which has a similar onset time to phosphatidylserine translocation. Our results show that a reduction in cellular volume is one of the earliest morphological changes in apoptosis, and membrane blebbing and phosphatidylserine translocation occur as subsequent biological and morphological changes. This is the first report to describe this series of morphological and biochemical changes ranging from an apoptotic volume decrease to membrane blebbing and PS translocation by scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). This new and direct imaging technique will provide new insight into the relationship between biochemical events inside a cell and cellular morphological changes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While compartment-specific trends in lysine acetylation have recently been investigated, its tissue-specific preferences remain unexplored. Here we present a comprehensive tissue-based analysis of sequence and structural features of lysine acetylation sites (LASs) based on the recent experimental data of Lundby et al. (2012). We show that acetylated substrates are characterized by tissue-specific motifs both in linear amino acid sequence and in spatial environments. We further demonstrate that the general tendency of LASs to reside in ordered regions and, specifically, in α-helices, is also subject to tissue specific variation. In line with previous findings we show that LASs are generally more evolutionarily conserved than non-LASs, especially in proteins with known function and in structurally regular regions. On the other hand, as revealed by metabolic pathway analysis, LASs have diverse cellular functions in different tissues and are frequently associated with tissue-specific protein domains. These findings may imply the existence of tissue-specific lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs).",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This paper addresses the question of whether, and with what algorithm, the three-dimensional principal components can be directly recovered from cryo-EM images. The first part of the paper extends the Fourier slice theorem to covariance functions showing that the three-dimensional covariance, and hence the principal components, of a heterogeneous particle can indeed be recovered from two-dimensional cryo-EM images. The second part of the paper proposes a practical algorithm for reconstructing the principal components directly from cryo-EM images without the intermediate step of calculating covariances.

Acoustic droplet ejection (ADE) was used to co-position 2.5nL of protein, precipitant, and chemicals on a MiTeGen in situ-1 crystallization plate™ for screening by co-crystallization or soaking. ADE-transferred droplets follow a precise trajectory which allows all components to be transferred through small apertures in the microplate lid. The apertures were large enough for 2.5nL droplets to pass through them, but small enough so that they did not disrupt the internal environment created by the mother liquor. Using this system, thermolysin and trypsin crystals were efficiently screened for binding to a heavy-metal mini-library. Fluorescence and X-ray diffraction were used to confirm that each chemical in the heavy-metal library was correctly paired with the intended protein crystal. A fragment mini-library was screened to observe two known lysozyme ligands using both co-crystallization and soaking.

Osteocytes reside in lacunae that are interconnected by canaliculi resulting in a vast cellular network within the mineralized bone matrix. As the structure of the lacuno-canalicular network is highly connected to osteocyte function, osteocyte lacunar properties such as volume, shape, orientation, and density are now frequently reported in studies investigating osteocyte activity. Despite this increasing interest in lacunar morphometrics, many studies show a large spread in such values, suggesting a large inter-species but also inter-site variation in lacunar properties. Here, osteocyte lacunae in rat cortical bone have been studied using synchrotron radiation micro computed tomography (SR μCT) and backscattered electron (BE) microscopy. Quantitative lacunar geometric characteristics are reported based on the synchrotron radiation data, differentiating between circumferential lamellar bone and a central, more disordered bone type. From these studies, no significant differences were found in lacunar volumes between lamellar and central bone, whereas significant differences in lacunar orientation, shape and density values were observed. The 3D nature of the SR μCT data sets furthermore revealed that lacunae in central bone, which appear to be poorly aligned in transverse 2D cross sections, are in fact highly aligned along the bone long axis. These results demonstrate the importance of using 3D methods to investigate anisotropic biological materials such as bone and that the appropriate choice of subregions for high resolution imaging is not trivial.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The multiple domains of the cellulosome complexes are often tethered to one another by intrinsically disordered regions. The properties and functions of these disordered linkers are unknown to a large extent. In this work, we study the conformational variability of one component of the cellulosome - the multi-domain xylanase Z (XynZ) of Clostridium thermocellum. We use a coarse-grained protein model to efficiently simulate conformations of the enzyme. Our simulation results are in excellent agreement with data from small angle X-ray scattering experiments, which validates the simulation outcome. Both in the presence and absence of the cohesin domain, the XynZ enzyme appears to be flexible in the sense that it takes various compact and extended conformations. The physical interactions between the individual domains are rather weak and transient, and the XynZ enzyme is held together mainly by the flexible linkers connecting the domains. The end-to-end distance distributions for the flexible linkers can be rationalized by the excluded volume effect. Taken together, our results provide a detailed picture of the conformational ensemble of the XynZ enzyme in solution.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Fusion of the tubules with the parasite membrane or the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) was also infrequent. Tiny adhesive links were observed for the first time connecting the IVN tubules.

The structures were resolved at 1.75Å (complex with squalene) and 1.6Å resolution (complex with 2,3-oxidosqualene), leading in both cases to clear images of the protein/substrate interactions. Ligand binding is facilitated by removal of the Golgi-dynamics (GOLD) C-terminal domain of SPF, which, as shown in previous structures of the apo-protein, blocked the opening of the binding pocket to the exterior. Both substrates bind into a large hydrophobic cavity, typical of such lipid-transporter family. Our structures report no specific recognition mode for the epoxide group. In fact, for both molecules, ligand affinity is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and independent investigations by computational models or differential scanning micro-calorimetry reveal similar binding affinities for both ligands. Our findings elucidate the molecular bases of the role of SPF in sterol endo-synthesis, supporting the original hypothesis that SPF is a facilitator of substrate flow within the sterol synthetic pathway. Moreover, our results suggest that the GOLD domain acts as a regulator, as its conformational displacement must occur to favor ligand binding and release during the different synthetic steps.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is unclear why there is such a large variation in the severity of the disease considering the repeating (Gly-X-Y)n sequence and the uniform rod-like structure of collagen. We systematically evaluate the effect of local (Gly-X-Y)n sequence around the mutation site on OI phenotype using integrated bio-statistical approaches, including odds ratio analysis and decision tree modeling. We show that different Gly → X mutations have different local sequence patterns that are correlated with lethal and nonlethal phenotypes providing a mechanism for understanding the sensitivity of local context in defining lethal and non-lethal OI. A number of important trends about which factors are related to OI phenotypes are revealed by the bio-statistical analyses; most striking is the complementary relationship between the placement of Pro residues and small residues and their correlation to OI phenotype. When Pro is present or small flexible residues are absent nearby a mutation site, the OI case tends to be lethal; when Pro is present or small flexible residues are absent further away from the mutation site, the OI case tends to be nonlethal. The analysis also reveals the dominant role of local sequence around mutation sites in the Major Ligand Binding Regions that are primarily responsible for collagen binding to its receptors and shows that non-lethal mutations are highly predicted by local sequence considerations alone whereas lethal mutations are not as easily predicted and may be a result of more complex interactions. Understanding the sequence determinants of OI mutations will enhance genetic counseling and help establish which steps in the collagen hierarchy to target for drug therapy.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The molluscan hemocyanin forms a decamer (cephalopods) or multidecamer (gastropods) of approximately 330-450kDa subunits, resulting in a molecular mass >3.3MDa.

The diffraction dataset at 3.0-Å resolution was collected by merging the datasets of two isomorphic crystals. Electron microscopy analysis of the dissolved crystals revealed cylindrical particles. Furthermore, self-rotation function analysis clearly showed the presence of a fivefold symmetry with several twofold symmetries perpendicular to the fivefold axis.

How this is achieved while producing a highly crystalline material composed of large calcite columnar single crystals remains largely unknown. Here we report that eggshell mineral originates from the accumulation of flat disk-shaped amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) particles on specific organic sites on the eggshell membrane, which are rich in proteins and sulfated proteoglycans. These structures known as mammillary cores promote the nucleation and stabilization of a amorphous calcium carbonate with calcitic short range order which predetermine the calcite composition of the mature eggshell. The amorphous nature of the precursor phase was confirmed by the diffuse scattering of X-rays and electrons. The nascent calcitic short-range order of this transient mineral phase was revealed by infrared spectroscopy and HRTEM. The ACC mineral deposited around the mammillary core sites progressively transforms directly into calcite crystals without the occurrence of any intermediate phase. Ionic speciation data suggest that the uterine fluid is equilibrated with amorphous calcium carbonate, throughout the duration of eggshell mineralization process, supporting that this mineral phase is constantly forming at the shell mineralization front. On the other hand, the transient amorphous calcium carbonate mineral deposits, as well as the calcite crystals into which they are converted, form by the ordered aggregation of nanoparticles that support the rapid mineralization of the eggshell. The results of this study alter our current understanding of avian eggshell calcification and provide new insights into the genesis and formation of calcium carbonate biominerals in vertebrates.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The photocycle consists of several spectroscopically distinct intermediates. The structural basis of the chloride transport mechanism remains elusive, presumably because packing contacts have so far precluded protein conformational changes in the available crystals. With the intention to structurally characterize late photocycle intermediates by X-ray crystallography we crystallized Halorhodopsin in a new crystal form using the vesicle fusion method. In the new crystal form lateral contacts are mediated by helices A and G. Helices E and F that were suggested to perform large movements during the photocycle are almost unrestrained by packing contacts. This feature might permit the displacement of these helices without disrupting the crystal lattice. Therefore, this new crystal form might be an excellent system for the structural characterization of late Halorhodopsin photocycle intermediates by trapping or by time resolved experiments, especially at XFELs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We report the crystal structure of Ma1120 in a monomeric form and its truncated construct as a dimer. Ma1120 exists as a monomer in solution and crystallized as a monomer in the absence of substrate or inhibitor. An additional α-helix present at the N-terminus of the monomeric structure blocks the active site by interacting with the substrate binding residues and occupying the dimer interface region. However, the enzyme has been found to be active in solution, indicating the movement of the helix away from the interface to facilitate the formation of active dimers in conditions favourable for catalysis. Thus, the N-terminal helix of Ma1120 keeps the enzyme in an autoinhibited state when it is not active. Deletion of this helix enabled us to crystallize the molecule as an active homodimer in the presence of a P-site inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxy-3'-ATP, or pyrophosphate along with metal ions. The substrate specifying lysine residue plays a dual role of interacting with the substrate and stabilizing the dimer. The dimerization loop region harbouring the second substrate specifying residue, an aspartate, shows significant differences in conformation and position between the monomeric and dimeric structures. Thus, this study has not only revealed that significant structural transitions are required for the interconversion of the inactive and the active forms of the enzyme, but also provided precise nature of these transitions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This catalytic triad is generally located in a very sharp turn of the protein backbone structure, called the nucleophilic elbow and identified by the consensus sequence GXSXG. An esterase from Sorangium cellulosum Soce56 that contains five nucleophilic elbows was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the function of each nucleophilic elbowed site was characterized. In order to elucidate the function of each nucleophilic elbow, site directed mutagenesis was used to generate variants with deactivated nucleophilic elbows and the functional promiscuity was analyzed. In silico analysis together with enzymological characterization interestingly showed that each nucleophilic elbow formed a local active site with varied substrate specificities and affinities. To our knowledge, this is the first report presenting the role of multiple nucleophilic elbows in the catalytic promiscuity of an esterase. Further structural analysis at protein unit level indicates the new evolutionary trajectories in emerging promiscuous esterases.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

With few exceptions, this biomineralized structure is composed of calcite, mixed together with a minor organic fraction, comprising secreted proteins that become occluded in the shell structure, once formed. This organic matrix is thought to display several functions, in particular, to control mineral deposition and to regulate crystallite shapes. Thus, identifying the primary structure of matrix proteins is a prerequisite for generating bioinspired materials with tailored properties. In this study, we employed a proteomic approach to identify numerous peptides that constitute the shell proteins, in three rhynchonellid brachiopods from different localities.

These models are usually validated by comparing the calculated atomic fluctuation for a single protein in a vacuum to experimental temperature factors in the crystal packing state. Without reflecting the crystal packing effect, in addition, their arbitrary assignment of spring constants leads to inaccurate simulation results, yielding a low correlation of the B-factor. To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust elastic network model (RENM) that not only considers the crystalline effect by using symmetric constraint information but also uses lumped masses and specific spring constants based on the type of amino acids and chemical interactions, respectively. Simulation results with more than 500 protein structures verify qualitatively and quantitatively that one can obtain the better correlation of the B-factor by RENM without additional computational burden. Moreover, an optimal spring constant in physical units (dyne/cm) is quantitatively determined as a function of the temperature at 100 and 290K, which enables us to predict the atomic fluctuations and vibrational density of states (VDOS) without a fitting process. The additional investigation of 80 high-resolution crystal structures with anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) indicates that RENM could give a full description of vibrational characteristics of individual residues in proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Upon binding viral double-stranded RNA, OAS enzymes produce 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates that stimulate RNase L and ultimately slow viral propagation. Truncations/mutations in the smallest human OAS isoform, OAS1, results in susceptibility to West Nile virus (WNV). We have previously demonstrated in vitro the interaction between OAS1 and the 5'-terminal region of the WNV RNA genome. Here we report that the 3'-terminal region is also able to mediate specific interaction with and activation of OAS1. Binding and kinetic experiments identified a specific stem loop within the 3'-terminal region that is sufficient for activation of the enzyme. The solution conformation of the 3'-terminal region was determined by small angle X-ray scattering, and computational models suggest a conformationally restrained structure comprised of a helix and short stem loop. Structural investigation of the 3'-terminal region in complex with OAS1 is also presented. Finally, we show that genome cyclization by base pairing between the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions, a required step for replication, is not sufficient to protect WNV from OAS1 recognition in vitro. These data provide a physical framework for understanding recognition of the highly structured terminal regions of a flaviviral genome by an innate immune enzyme.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Two major intra-molecular interactions, the polar core and the three-element region, maintain arrestins in the basal conformation by connecting the N- and C-domains. Mutations in these regions that disrupt the polar core (R169E or p44) or the three-element (3A) have been reported to interact with GPCRs in a phosphorylation-independent manner, and thus these mutants are referred to as pre-activated arrestins. On the other hand, deletion of 7 residues in the linker region between N- and C-domains (Δ7) freezes arrestins in the inactive state, which has a much lower binding affinity to GPCRs compared to the wild type form. Although these mutants are widely used for functional studies of arrestins, the conformations of these mutants have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed the conformational dynamics of β-arrestin1 with various mutants (R169E, p44, 3A, and Δ7) by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). HDX-MS data revealed that pre-activated mutants have more deuterium uptake than the basal state, and also that the regions and degree of increased deuterium uptake differ between pre-activated mutants. Unexpectedly, the inactive mutant also showed increased deuterium uptake in a few regions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Differential scanning calorimetry and molecular dynamics.,"Tissue specific isoforms of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, somatic (GAPD) and sperm-specific (GAPDS), have been reported to display different levels of both stability and catalytic activity. Here we apply MD simulations to investigate molecular basis of this phenomenon. The protein is a tetramer where each subunit consists of two domains - catalytic and NAD-binding one. We demonstrated key residues responsible for intersubunit and interdomain interactions. Effect of several residues was studied by point mutations. Overall we considered three mutations (Glu96Gln, Glu244Gln and Asp311Asn) disrupting GAPDS-specific salt bridges. Comparison of calculated interaction energies with calorimetric enthalpies confirmed that intersubunit interactions were responsible for enhanced thermostability of GAPDS whereas interdomain interactions had indirect influence on intersubunit contacts. Mutation Asp311Asn was around 10Å far from the active center and corresponded to the closest natural substitution in the isoenzymes. MD simulations revealed that this residue had slight interaction with catalytic residues but influenced the hydrogen bond net and dynamics in active site. These effects can be responsible for a strong influence of this residue on catalytic activity. Overall, our results provide new insight into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structure-function relationships and can be used for the engineering of mutant proteins with modified properties and for development of new inhibitors with indirect influence on the catalytic site.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Acquisition of dual axis tilt series can decrease these effects. However, in cryo-electron tomography, to limit the electron radiation damage that occurs during imaging, the total dose should not increase and must be fractionated over the two tilt series. Here we set out to determine whether it is beneficial fractionate electron dose for recording dual axis cryo electron tilt series or whether it is better to perform single axis acquisition. To assess the quality of tomographic reconstructions in different directions here we introduce conical Fourier shell correlation (cFSCe/o). Employing cFSCe/o, we compared the resolution isotropy of single-axis and dual-axis (cryo-)electron tomograms using even/odd split data sets. We show that the resolution of dual-axis simulated and cryo-electron tomograms in the plane orthogonal to the electron beam becomes more isotropic compared to single-axis tomograms and high resolution peaks along the tilt axis disappear. cFSCe/o also allowed us to compare different methods for the alignment of dual-axis tomograms. We show that different tomographic reconstruction programs produce different anisotropic resolution in dual axis tomograms. We anticipate that cFSCe/o can also be useful for comparisons of acquisition and reconstruction parameters, and different hardware implementations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a new mathematical framework for accelerating maximum-likelihood reconstructions. The speedup is by orders of magnitude and the proposed algorithm produces similar quality reconstructions compared to the standard maximum-likelihood formulation. Our approach uses subspace approximations of the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data and projection images, greatly reducing the number of image transformations and comparisons that are computed.

In this study we extend our work on the structure and material properties of the incisive cuticle employing electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and investigate calcite orientation patterns in the PI of two terrestrial isopod species from different habitats. We trace small-scale differences in texture sharpness and calcite microstructure, and compare calcite organization and orientation patterns in the PI with those in the tergites of the same isopod species. We observe that in the PI calcite orientation, the degree of crystal alignment, and mode of crystalline domain assemblage is highly varied within short length scales. This contrasts to calcite organization in the tergite cuticle, where calcite has only one specific texture pattern. Such a large range in the variation of calcite organization has not been observed in other carbonate biological hard tissues, such as shells and teeth, where one specific texture and microstructure prevails. Thus, the investigated isopod species are able to control crystallization of the amorphous carbonate precursor in a differential way, most probably related to the function of the individual skeletal element and the animals' behavior.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Available data suggested that the interaction of positively charged amino acids of AS-48 with the membrane would produce membrane destabilization and disruption. Alternatively, it has been proposed that AS-48 activity could rely on the effective insertion of the bacteriocin into the membrane. The biological and structural properties of the AS-48G13K/L40K double mutant were investigated to shed light on this subject. Compared with the wild type, the mutant protein suffered an important reduction in the antibacterial activity. Biochemical and structural studies of AS-48G13K/L40K mutant suggest the basis of its decreased antimicrobial activity. Lipid cosedimentation assays showed that the membrane affinity of AS-48G13K/L40K is 12-fold lower than that observed for the wild type. L40K mutation is responsible for this reduced membrane affinity and thus, hydrophobic interactions are involved in membrane association. Furthermore, the high-resolution crystal structure of AS-48G13K/L40K, together with the study of its dimeric character in solution showed that G13K stabilizes the inactive water-soluble dimer, which displays a reduced dipole moment. Our data suggest that the cumulative effect of these three affected properties reduces AS-48 activity, and point out that the bactericidal effect is achieved by the electrostatically driven approach of the inactive water-soluble dimer towards the membrane, followed by the dissociation and insertion of the protein into the lipid bilayer.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (tmSAHH) has great potentials in industrial applications because of its hyperthermophilic properties. Here, two crystal structures of tmSAHH in complex with NAD(+) show both open and closed conformations despite the absence of bound substrate. Each subunit of the tetrameric enzyme is composed of three domains, namely the catalytic domain, the NAD(+)-binding domain and the C-terminal domain. The NAD(+) binding mode is clearly observed and a substrate analogue can also be modeled into the active site, where two cysteine residues in mesophilic enzymes are replaced by serine and threonine in tmSAHH. Notably, the C-terminal domain of tmSAHH lacks the second loop region of mesophilic SAHH, which is important in NAD(+) binding, and thus exposes the bound cofactor to the solvent. The difference explains the higher NAD(+) requirement of tmSAHH because of the reduced affinity. Furthermore, the feature of missing loop is consistently observed in thermophilic bacterial and archaeal SAHHs, and may be related to their thermostability.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A limitation in the study of radiation sensitive biological samples is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the tomograms which may obscure fine details. To overcome this limitation, the recently developed Volta phase plate (VPP) was applied in electron cryotomographic studies of a wide range of cellular structures, from magnetotactic bacteria to primary cultured neurons. The results show that the VPP improves contrast significantly and consequently the signal-to-noise ratio of the tomograms, moreover it avoids disturbing fringing artifacts typical for Zernike phase plates. The contrast improvement provided by the VPP was also confirmed in projection images of relatively thick (∼400nm) samples. In order to investigate the respective contributions of the VPP and the energy filter, images acquired with different combinations of the two were compared. Zero-loss energy filtering reduced the background noise in thicker areas of the sample and improved the contrast of features such as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules in magnetotactic bacteria, whereas the VPP provided an overall contrast improvement for all sample areas. After 3D reconstruction, tomograms acquired with the combination of a VPP and an energy filter showed structural features in neuronal processes with outstanding clarity. We also show that the VPP can be combined with focused ion beam milling to examine structures embedded deeply inside cells.

Using this technique, we show that the canonical single frequency sarcomeric SHG intensity pattern (SHG-IP) of premetamorphic xenopus tadpole tail muscles is converted to double frequency (2f) sarcomeric SHG-IP in metamorphic climax stages due to massive physiological muscle proteolysis. This conversion was found to rise from 7% in premetamorphic muscles to about 97% in fragmented muscular apoptotic bodies. Moreover a 66% conversion was also found in non-fragmented metamorphic tail muscles. Also, a strong correlation between predominant 2f sarcomeric SHG-IPs and myofibrillar misalignment is established with electron microscopy. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the higher sensitivity and the supra resolution power of SHG microscopy over TPEF to reveal 3D myofibrillar misalignment. From this study, we suggest that 2f sarcomeric SHG-IP could be used as signature of triad defect and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. As the mechanism of muscle proteolysis is similar to that found in mdx mouse muscles, we further suggest that xenopus tadpole tail resorption at climax stages could be used as an alternative or complementary model of Duchene muscular dystrophy.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The folds of the dentine do not invade the whole pulp cavity of the tooth contrary to the plicated condition of most fossil sarcopterygian fishes (e.g., Eusthenopteron, Porolepis, Megalichthys) certain fossil marine reptiles (ichthyosaurs) and extant varanids; in Latimeria they are limited to the lower third to the half of the pulp cavity.

The crystal structure of RobpsCRA at 1.85Å resolution reveals unusual molecular determinants responsible for the lack of its ancestral chitinase activity. Unlike other chitinase-like proteins, which lack chitinase catalytic residues, RobpsCRA has conserved its catalytic machinery. However, concerted rearrangements of loop regions coupled to non-conservative substitutions of aromatic residues central to the chitin-binding groove explain the lack of hydrolytic activity against chitin and the switch toward recognition of high-mannose type N-glycans. Identification of close homologs in flowering plants with conservation of sequence motifs associated to the structural adaptations seen in RobpsCRA defines an emerging class of agglutinins, as emphasized by a phylogenetic analysis, that are likely to share a similar carbohydrate binding specificity for high-mannose type N-glycans. This study illustrates the recent evolution and molecular adaptation of a versatile TIM-barrel scaffold within the ancestral GH18 family.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

ID1 has been shown to play a role in tRNA aminoacylation, mediating interaction with the acceptor arm of tRNA and diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) synthesis. Mutations in α2GRS, including those in the ID1 region, have been implicated in distal hereditary motor neuropathy-V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Through sequence and structure based evolutionary analysis, we show that ID1 of α2GRS is a rubredoxin-like zinc ribbon domain. The zinc-chelating cysteines of ID1 are well conserved in all archaeal versions of the enzyme and also in several eukaryotes, which most likely have acquired them via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria; but in all other eukaryotes, the zinc-chelating residues are not preserved. ID1 from bacteria display a selective preservation of zinc-binding residues, ranging from complete conservation to complete loss. The ID1 from different organisms harbor variable-sized non-conserved insertions between the two zinc-binding half-sites of the zinc ribbon. Three of the previously identified CMT-associated mutations in α2GRS, viz., human D146N, mouse C157R and human S211F, are located in the zinc ribbon region of ID1. Interestingly, human Asp146 which is implicated in the synthesis of Ap4A, a molecule known to act during neuronal transmission, has also been reported to be mutated in dHMN-V, suggesting a possible link between hereditary motor neuropathy and Ap4A synthesis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Recent studies have identified two bacterial and one plant GH63 mannosylglycerate hydrolases that act on both glucosylglycerate and mannosylglycerate, which are compatible solutes found in many thermophilic prokaryotes and some plants. Here we report the 1.67-Å crystal structure of one of these GH63 mannosylglycerate hydrolases, Tt8MGH from Thermus thermophilus HB8, which is 99% homologous to mannosylglycerate hydrolase from T. thermophilus HB27. Tt8MGH consists of a single (α/α)6-barrel catalytic domain with two additional helices and two long loops which form a homotrimer. The structures of this protein in complexes with glucose or glycerate were also determined at 1.77- or 2.10-Å resolution, respectively. A comparison of these structures revealed that the conformations of three flexible loops were largely different from each other. The conformational changes may be induced by ligand binding and serve to form finger-like structures for holding substrates.

Oligodendrocytes form CNS myelin; the prevailing hypothesis being that they do it by extending a process that circumnavigates the axon. It is pertinent to ask how myelin is built because oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and myelin are compositionally different. To this end, we examined oligodendrocyte cultures and embryonic avian optic nerves by electron microscopy, immuno-electron microscopy and three-dimensional electron tomography. The results support three novel concepts. Myelin membranes are synthesized as tubules and packaged into ""myelinophore organelles"" in the oligodendrocyte perikaryon. Myelin membranes are matured in and transported by myelinophore organelles within an oligodendrocyte process. The myelin sheath is generated by myelin membrane fusion inside an oligodendrocyte process. These findings abrogate the dogma of myelin resulting from a wrapping motion of an oligodendrocyte process and open up new avenues in the quest for understanding myelination in health and disease.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) is a plant defense mechanism in which plant resistance proteins recognize the presence of effectors and initiate immune responses. Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) in Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a central node protein for basal immune resistance and ETI by interacting dynamically with other immune regulatory or resistance proteins. Recently, the effector HopA1 from Pseudomonas syringae was shown to affect these EDS1 complexes by binding EDS1 directly and activating the immune response signaling pathway. Here, we report the crystal structure of the effector HopA1 from P. syringae pv. syringae strain 61 and tomato strain DC3000. HopA1, a sequence-unrelated protein to EDS1, has an α+β fold in which the central antiparallel β-sheet is flanked by helices. A similar structural domain, an α/β fold, is one of the two domains in both EDS1 and the EDS1-interacting protein SAG101, and plays a crucial role in forming the EDS1 complex. Further analyses suggest structural similarity and differences between HopA1 and the α/β fold of SAG101, as well as between two HopA1s from different pathovars.

The overall fold of CLas-ZnuA2 is similar to the related cluster A-I family SBPs. The sequence and structure analysis revealed the unique features of CLas-ZnuA2. The comparison of CLas-ZnuA2 structure in three states showed that metal binding and release is facilitated by a large displacement along with a change in orientation of the side chain for one of the metal binding residue (His39) flipped away from metal binding site in metal-free form. The crystal structure captured in intermediate state of metal binding revealed the changes in conformation and interaction of the loop hosting His39 during the metal binding. A rigid body movement of C-domain along with partial unfolding of linker helix at its C-terminal during metal binding, as reported for PsaA, was not observed in CLas-ZnuA2.

Measurements by holographic microscopy showed significant differences in average cell number, confluence, volume and area when comparing etoposide-treated with untreated cells. The cell volume of the treated cell lines was initially increased at early time-points. By time, cells decreased in volume, especially when treated with high doses of etoposide. In conclusion, we have shown that holographic microscopy allows label-free and completely non-invasive morphological measurements of cell growth, viability and death.

It has been shown that colchicine entering the diatom cell inhibits polymerization of tubulin, the main protein of microtubules, thereby disrupting the normal processes of biogenic silica deposition and daughter valve morphogenesis. In this study, experiments with a synchronized culture of the pennate diatom Synedra acus have been performed to determine the timing and duration of the formation of various valve components and analyze the effect of colchicine at a subtoxic concentration on the structure of daughter valves at different stages of their morphogenesis. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed several types of micro- and nanoscale anomalies in daughter valve morphology, with their frequency varying depending on the time of colchicine treatment. Laser scanning microscopy of preparations vitally stained with Tubulin Tracker Green has shown that polymerized tubulin at early stages of valve morphogenesis is localized along the periphery of the developing valve. This is evidence for an important role of microtubules in the horizontal growth of the valve at the stage when its general structural pattern is established, including its shape and arrangement of basic micro- and nanostructures.

These stages of the viral life cycle require intricate coordination of viral components whose structures are being revealed by single molecule experiments and high resolution (cryo-electron microscopy) reconstructions. For example, during packaging, bacteriophages employ some of the strongest known molecular motors to package DNA against increasing pressure within the viral capsid shell. Located upstream of the motor is an elaborate portal system through which DNA is threaded. A high resolution reconstruction of the portal system for bacteriophage ϕ29 reveals that DNA buckles inside a small cavity under large compressive forces. In this study, we demonstrate that DNA can also buckle in other bacteriophages including T7 and P22. Using a computational rod model for DNA, we demonstrate that a DNA buckle can initiate and grow within the small confines of a cavity under biologically-attainable force levels. The forces of DNA-cavity contact and DNA-DNA electrostatic repulsion ultimately limit cavity filling. Despite conforming to very different cavity geometries, the buckled DNA within T7 and P22 exhibits near equal volumetric energy density (∼1kT/nm(3)) and energetic cost of packaging (∼22kT). We hypothesize that a DNA buckle creates large forces on the cavity interior to signal the conformational changes to end packaging. In addition, a DNA buckle may help retain the genome prior to tail assembly through significantly increased contact area with the portal.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we report the structures of two USPs, YnaF and YdaA from Salmonella typhimurium determined at 1.8Å and 2.4Å resolutions, respectively. YnaF consists of a single USP domain and forms a tetrameric organization stabilized by interactions mediated through chloride ions. YdaA is a larger protein consisting of two tandem USP domains. Two protomers of YdaA associate to form a structure similar to the YnaF tetramer. YdaA showed ATPase activity and an ATP binding motif G-2X-G-9X-G(S/T/N) was found in its C-terminal domain. The residues corresponding to this motif were not conserved in YnaF although YnaF could bind ATP. However, unlike YdaA, YnaF did not hydrolyse ATP in vitro. Disruption of interactions mediated through chloride ions by selected mutations converted YnaF into an ATPase. Residues that might be important for ATP hydrolysis could be identified by comparing the active sites of native and mutant structures. Only the C-terminal domain of YdaA appears to be involved in ATP hydrolysis. The structurally similar N-terminal domain was found to bind a zinc ion near the segment equivalent to the phosphate binding loop of the C-terminal domain. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that YdaA might bind a ligand of approximate molecular weight 800daltons. Structural comparisons suggest that the ligand, probably related to an intermediate in lipid A biosynthesis, might bind at a site close to the zinc ion. Therefore, the N-terminal domain of YdaA binds zinc and might play a role in lipid metabolism.

Nevertheless, ontogenetic changes associated with calcareous tube composition and structures have not yet been studied. Here, the ultrastructure and composition of the calcareous tubes built by H. elegans was examined in the three early calcifying juvenile stages and in the adult using XRD, FTIR, ICP-OES, SEM and Raman spectroscopy. Ontogenetic shifts in carbonate mineralogy were observed, for example, juvenile tubes contained more amorphous calcium carbonate and were predominantly aragonitic whereas adult tubes were bimineralic with considerably more calcite. The mineral composition gradually shifted during the tube development as shown by a decrease in Sr/Ca and an increase of Mg/Ca ratios with the tubeworm's age. The inner tube layer contained calcite, whereas the outer layer contained aragonite. Similarly, the tube complexity in terms of ultrastructure was associated with development. The sequential appearance of unoriented ultrastructures followed by oriented ultrastructures may reflect the evolutionary history of serpulid tube biominerals.

Similar to antibodies, pentraxins can also activate opsonisation and phagocytosis by interacting with Fc receptors (FcRs).

The structures reveal that the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) in the recognition face of Dare-PTX is deep and narrow. Homology modelling shows that LBPs from different Dare-PTX loci differ in shape, reflecting their specific recognition abilities. Furthermore, in comparison with the structure of hCPR, a new C1q binding mode was identified in Dare-PTX. In addition, the FcR-binding sites of hSAP are partially conserved in Dare-PTX.

PPiases are divided into two structurally distinct families: family I PPiases are Mg(2+)-dependent and present in most archaea, eukaryotes and prokaryotes, whereas the relatively less understood family II PPiases are Mn(2+)-dependent and present only in some archaea, bacteria and primitive eukaryotes. Staphylococcus aureus (SA), a dangerous pathogen and a frequent cause of hospital infections, contains a family II PPiase (PpaC), which is an attractive potential target for development of novel antibacterial agents. We determined a crystal structure of SA PpaC in complex with catalytic Mn(2+) at 2.1Å resolution. The active site contains two catalytic Mn(2+) binding sites, each half-occupied, reconciling the previously observed 1:1 Mn(2+):enzyme stoichiometry with the presence of two divalent metal ion sites in the apo-enzyme. Unexpectedly, despite the absence of the substrate or products in the active site, the two domains of SA PpaC form a closed active site, a conformation observed in structures of other family II PPiases only in complex with substrate or product mimics. A region spanning residues 295-298, which contains a conserved substrate binding RKK motif, is flipped out of the active site, an unprecedented conformation for a PPiase. Because the mutant of Arg295 to an alanine is devoid of activity, this loop likely undergoes an induced-fit conformational change upon substrate binding and product dissociation. This closed conformation of SA PPiase may serve as an attractive target for rational design of inhibitors of this enzyme.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition, instrument hardware and data collection protocols can be modified such that several of these measurements can be performed on irregularly shaped samples with complex surface geometries and without the need for extensive sample preparation. Using these approaches, in conjunction with whole animal micro-computed tomography studies, we have been able to spatially resolve micron and sub-micron structural features across macroscopic length scales on entire urchin tooth cross-sections and correlate these complex morphological features with local variability in elemental composition.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Heterologous sequences have been successfully inserted at both amino and carboxy termini as well as internally at the major immunodominant epitope. We used cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) and three-dimensional image reconstruction to investigate the structure of VLPs assembled from an N-terminal extended HBcAg that contained a polyhistidine tag. The insert was seen to form a trimeric spike on the capsid surface that was poorly resolved, most likely owing to it being flexible. We hypothesise that the capacity of N-terminal inserts to form trimers may have application in the development of multivalent vaccines to trimeric antigens.

We have explored this approach in attempts to overcome an order-disorder phenomenon that complicated the structural analysis of the enzyme Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (P5CDH, Mtb-PruA). Using the Silver Bullets Bio screen, we obtained new crystal packing using cobalamin as a co-crystallization agent. This crystal form did not display the order-disorder phenomenon previously encountered. Solution of the crystal structure showed that cobalamin molecules are present in the crystal contacts.

As the new detectors still require comparative characterization, we have used tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a test specimen to study the quality of 3D image reconstructions from data recorded on the two direct electron detector cameras, K2 Summit and Falcon II. Using DED movie frames, we explored related image-processing aspects and compared the performance of micrograph-based and segment-based motion correction approaches.

It is generally assumed that the overall properties of the native protein are retained in the chimera, and that functional differences reflect only the specific determinants contained in the swapped domains. Here we used this strategy to circumvent the difficulty in obtaining crystals of Rickettsia prowazekii RalF, a bacterial protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eukaryotic Arf GTPases. A RalF homolog is encoded by Legionella pneumophila, in which a C-terminal capping domain auto-inhibits the catalytic Sec7 domain and localizes the protein to the Legionella-containing vacuole. The crystal structures of domain-swapped chimeras were determined and used to construct a model of Legionella RalF with a RMSD of less than 1Å with the crystal structure, which validated the use of this approach to build a model of Rickettsia RalF. In the Rickettsia RalF model, sequence differences in the capping domain that target it to specific membranes are accommodated by a shift of the entire domain with respect to the Sec7 domain. However, local sequence changes also give rise to an artifactual salt bridge in one of the chimeras, which likely explains why this chimera is recalcitrant to activation. These findings highlight the structural plasticity whereby chimeras can be engineered, but also underline that unpredictable differences can modify their biochemical responses.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Viral packaging motors are the strongest of all biological motors, but it is not known how they generate these forces. Several models for the process of mechanochemical force generation have been put forward, but there is no consensus on which, if any, of these is correct. All the existing models assume that protein-generated forces drive the DNA forward. The scrunchworm hypothesis proposes that the DNA molecule is the active force-generating core of the motor, not simply a substrate on which the motor operates. The protein components of the motor dehydrate a section of the DNA, converting it from the B form to the A form and shortening it by about 23%. The proteins then rehydrate the DNA, which converts back to the B form. Other regions of the motor grip and release the DNA to capture the shortening-lengthening motions of the B→A→B cycle (""scrunching""), so that DNA is pulled into the motor and pushed forward into the capsid. This DNA-centric mechanism provides a quantitative physical explanation for the magnitude of the forces generated by viral packaging motors. It also provides a simple explanation for the fact that each of the steps in the burst cycle advances the DNA by 2.5 base pairs. The scrunchworm hypothesis is consistent with a large body of published data, and it makes four experimentally testable predictions.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

This technique relies on electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, grown generally by reconstitution of purified membrane proteins into proteoliposomes under conditions favoring the formation of well-ordered lattices. Growing these crystals presents one of the major hurdles in the application of this technique. To identify conditions favoring crystallization a wide range of factors that can lead to a vast matrix of possible reagent combinations must be screened. However, in 2D crystallization these factors have traditionally been surveyed in a relatively limited fashion. To address this problem we carried out a detailed analysis of published 2D crystallization conditions for 12 β-barrel and 138 α-helical membrane proteins. From this analysis we identified the most successful conditions and applied them in the design of new sparse and incomplete factorial matrices to screen membrane protein 2D crystallization. Using these matrices we have run 19 crystallization screens for 16 different membrane proteins totaling over 1300 individual crystallization conditions. Six membrane proteins have yielded diffracting 2D crystals suitable for structure determination, indicating that these new matrices show promise to accelerate the success rate of membrane protein 2D crystallization.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The results demonstrate that the heterodimer can withstand limited oxidation through the incorporation of up to some 10 oxygen atoms per subunit protein without any appreciable change to its average collision cross section and thus conformation. These results are in accord with the oxidation levels and timescales applicable to radical probe mass spectrometry (RP-MS) based protein footprinting experiments. Following prolonged exposure, the heterodimer is increasingly degraded through cleavage of the backbone of the subunit crystallins rather than denaturation such that heterodimeric structures with altered conformations and ion mobilities were not detected. However, evidence from measurements of oxidation levels within peptide segments, suggest the presence of some aggregated structure involving C-terminal domain segments of βB3 crystallin across residues 115-126 and 152-166.

In our research, we focus on predicting the protein binding sites, which could be used to functionally annotate the protein structures. In this paper we consider a set of sixteen amino acid residues' features, and by applying various feature selection techniques we estimate their significance. Although the number of features in our case is not high, we perform feature selection in order to improve the prediction power and time complexity of the prediction models. The results show that by applying proper feature selection technique, the predictive performance of the classification algorithms is improved, i.e., by considering the most relevant features we induce more accurate models than if we consider the entire set of features. Furthermore, the model complexity, as well as the training and testing times are decreased by performing feature selection. We also compare our approach with several existing methods for protein binding sites prediction. The results demonstrate that the existing methods considered in this research are specific and applicable to the group of proteins for which the model was developed, while our approach is more generic and can be applied to a wider class of proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Unlike other Rex proteins that regulate aerobic respiration, RSP controls ethanol fermentation in the obligate anaerobe Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200(T). It is also found in other anaerobic microorganisms. Here we present the crystal structures of apo-RSP, RSP/NADH and RSP/NAD(+)/DNA, which are the first structures of Rex-family members from an obligate anaerobe. RSP functions as a homodimer. It assumes an open conformation when bound to the operator DNA and a closed conformation when not DNA-bound. The DNA binds to the N-terminal winged-helix domain and the dinucleotide, either reduced or oxidized, binds to the C-terminal Rossmann-fold domain. The two distinct orientations of nicotinamide ring, anti in NADH and syn in NAD(+), give rise to two sets of protein-ligand interactions. Consequently, NADH binding makes RSP into a closed conformation, which does not bind to DNA. Both the conserved residues and the DNA specificity of RSP show a number of variations from those of the aerobic Rex, reflecting different structural bases for redox-sensing by the anaerobic and aerobic Rex-family members.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Dendrophyllia cribrosa exhibits a sympodial dendroid form, characteristically large coralla, and occasional fusions of adjacent branches within the same colony. Adjacent corallites are bound and supported by coenosteum skeleton. This study examined the inner skeletal structures at the junctions of fused branches using a non-destructive microfocus X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging approach, and considered the reasons for the large colonial sizes and their adaptive significance. Three-dimensional reconstructions of two-dimensional X-ray CT images reveal that individual corallites are not directly connected in fused parts. Additionally, no completely buried individuals were found within fused skeleton. When adjacent branches approach one another, constituent corallites change their growth directions to avoid collisions between the branches. The adjacent branches fuse without a reduction in the number of constituent corallites, leading to the establishment of reticular and rigid colonial structures. In addition, a nearly even distribution of individuals on the colony surface facilitates efficient intake of nutrients. Thus, the growth of large D. cribrosa colonies involves avoidance of collision between constituent individuals, the reinforcement of colonial structure, and efficient uptake of nutrients. These observations provide insights on the dynamics of interrelationships between colony-making mechanisms and the adaptive strategies required under habitat conditions such as specific current activities.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Transcription levels of these genes are very high throughout interphase, and the cell needs a special strategy to avoid collision of the DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase machineries. To investigate this problem, we measured the correlation of various replication and transcription signals in the nucleoli of HeLa, HT-1080 and NIH 3T3 cells using a specially devised software for analysis of confocal images. Additionally, to follow the relationship between nucleolar replication and transcription in living cells, we produced a stable cell line expressing GFP-RPA43 (subunit of RNA polymerase I, pol I) and RFP-PCNA (the sliding clamp protein) based on human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells. We found that replication and transcription signals are more efficiently separated in nucleoli than in the nucleoplasm. In the course of S phase, separation of PCNA and pol I signals gradually increased. During the same period, separation of pol I and incorporated Cy5-dUTP signals decreased. Analysis of single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images indicated that transcriptionally active FC/DFC units (i.e. fibrillar centers with adjacent dense fibrillar components) did not incorporate DNA nucleotides.

VapCs form a family of ribonucleases that possess a PIN-domain assembly and are known as toxins. The activities of VapCs are impaired by VapB antitoxins.

The distribution of the catalytic-site residues of the VapC-15 toxin is similar to that of T4 RNase H and of Methanococcus jannaschii FEN-1, providing strong evidence that these three proteins share a similar mechanism of activity. The presence of both VapB2C2 and VapBC2 emphasizes the fact that the same antitoxin can bind the toxin in 1:1 and 1:2 ratios.

We found that the monomer is the dominant species of phosphorylated LRAP (LRAP(+P)) over a range of solution conditions (pH 2.7-4.1, pH 4.5-8, 50 mmol/L(mM) to 200 mM NaCl, 0.065-2 mg/mL). The monomer is also the dominant species for unphosphorylated LRAP (LRAP(-P)) at pH 7.4 and for LRAP(+P) in the presence of 2.5 mM calcium at pH 7.4. LRAP aggregates in a narrow pH range near the isoelectric point of pH 4.1. SV and SANS show that the LRAP monomer has a radius of ∼2.0 nm and an asymmetric structure, and solution NMR studies indicate that the monomer is largely unstructured. This work provides new insights into the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of LRAP in solution and provides evidence that the monomeric species may be an important functional form of some amelogenins.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The ligand-binding domain of cereblon is found, with a high degree of conservation, in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Using a bacterial model system, we reveal the structural determinants of cereblon substrate recognition, based on a series of high-resolution crystal structures. For the first time, we identify a cellular ligand that is universally present: we show that thalidomide and its derivatives mimic and compete for the binding of uridine, and validate these findings in vivo. The nature of the binding pocket, an aromatic cage of three tryptophan residues, further suggests a role in the recognition of cationic ligands. Our results allow for general evaluation of pharmaceuticals for potential cereblon-dependent teratogenicity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous studies have established that both components reside within the same single-chain molecule. In the present study the homology in a wide range of aligned sequences is used to gain insights into the structure and function of the molecular segments associated with the filament and with the matrix. The notion that all molecules contain a β-rich 34-residue segment associated with the framework of the filament is reinforced by the present study. In addition, the residues involved in the polymerization of the molecules to form filaments are identified. In the Archosaurs (birds, crocodiles and turtles), and the Squamates (snakes and lizards) segments rich in glycine and tyrosine can be identified in the C-terminal domain. In Rhynocephalians (tuataras) and Squamates a similar segment is inserted at a specific point in the N-terminal domain. In some Archosaurian appendages (both avian and reptilian) segments rich in charged residues and cysteine are found in the N-terminal domain. The likely effect of these segments will be to soften the tissue without compromising its insolubility. The structure and role of the various molecular segments identified in this study and the way in which they might manifest themselves in terms of the physical properties of the particular epidermal appendage in which they appear are also discussed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Therefore, the search for and investigation of amorphous biominerals in bivalve shells are of great importance and interest. Here, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), we investigate the microstructure and mineralogy of the periostracum in Perna viridis. We find that: (1) the periostracum has three layers, of which the inner and outer layer are of proteins, while the middle layer is mineralized with nanospheres of amorphous biominerals; (2) the nanospheres are of amorphous carbonated Ca-Mg phosphate (ACCP), where the CO3(2)(-)/PO4(3)(-) weight ratio is estimated to be ∼0.3, and the Ca/P and Ca/Mg atomic ratio is ∼1.4 and 1.6, respectively; (3) the nanospheres, with a diameter of 43-106nm, are found to assemble into spherules with a diameter of 160-500nm, which are further organized into parallel microlayers separated by the proteins; and (4) the nanospheres are assumed to function as the pH stabilizer to facilitate the shell's initial mineralization. Finally, we expect that these findings will advance our understanding of the shell's biomineralization process.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This tool is of major importance in neurobiology and allows the study of brain cells such as microglia, astrocytes, neurons and their inter/intracellular communications via ion channels or transporters. In combination with light/fluorescence microscopies, acute brain slices enable the ex vivo analysis of specific cells or groups of cells inside the slice, e.g. astrocytes. To bridge ex vivo knowledge of a cell with its ultrastructure, we developed a correlative microscopy approach for acute brain slices. The workflow begins with sampling of the tissue and precise trimming of a region of interest, which contains GFP-tagged astrocytes that can be visualised by fluorescence microscopy of ultrathin sections. The astrocytes and their surroundings are then analysed by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). An important aspect of this workflow is the modification of a commercial cryo-ultramicrotome to observe the fluorescent GFP signal during the trimming process. It ensured that sections contained at least one GFP astrocyte. After cryo-sectioning, a map of the GFP-expressing astrocytes is established and transferred to correlation software installed on a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope equipped with a STEM detector. Next, the areas displaying fluorescence are selected for high resolution STEM imaging. An overview area (e.g. a whole mesh of the grid) is imaged with an automated tiling and stitching process. In the final stitched image, the local organisation of the brain tissue can be surveyed or areas of interest can be magnified to observe fine details, e.g. vesicles or gold labels on specific proteins. The robustness of this workflow is contingent on the quality of sample preparation, based on Tokuyasu's protocol. This method results in a reasonable compromise between preservation of morphology and maintenance of antigenicity. Finally, an important feature of this approach is that the fluorescence of the GFP signal is preserved throughout the entire preparation process until the last step before electron microscopy.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

By analyzing entire mouse islets, we show that it is possible to determine (1) the distributions of alpha and beta cells, (2) the organization of blood vessels and pericapillary spaces, and (3) the ultrastructure of the individual secretory cells. Our results show that the average volume of a beta cell is nearly twice that of an alpha cell, and the total mitochondrial volume is about four times larger. In contrast, nuclear volumes in the two cell types are found to be approximately equal. Although the cores of alpha and beta secretory granules have similar diameters, the beta granules have prominent halos resulting in overall diameters that are twice those of alpha granules. Visualization of the blood vessels revealed that every secretory cell in the islet is in contact with the pericapillary space, with an average contact area of 9±5% of the cell surface area. Our data show that consistent results can be obtained by analyzing small numbers of islets. Due to the complicated architecture of pancreatic islets, such precision cannot easily be achieved by using TEM of thin sections.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We have crystallized the complex between the SH3 domain of the c-Src tyrosine kinase and the C-terminal proline rich motif of the NS5A protein (A349PPIPPPRRKR359). Crystals obtained at neutral pH belong to the space group I41, with a single molecule of the SH3/NS5A complex at the asymmetric unit. The NS5A peptide is bound in a reverse orientation (class II) and the comparison of this structure with those of the high affinity synthetic peptides APP12 and VSL12 shows some important differences at the salt bridge that drives the peptide orientation. Further conformational changes in residues placed apart from the binding site also seem to play an important role in the binding orientation of this peptide. Our results show the interaction of the SH3 domain of the c-Src tyrosine kinase with a proline rich motif in the NS5A protein and point to their potential interaction in vivo.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To investigate the consequences of this layered growth on the local structure and composition of the gastrolith, we performed spatially-resolved Raman, X-ray and SEM-EDS analysis on complete pre-molt gastrolith cross-sections. Results show that especially the abundance of inorganic phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)/citrate and proteins is not uniform throughout the organ but changes from layer to layer. Based on these results we can conclude that ACC stabilization in the gastrolith takes place by more than one compound and not by only one of these additives.",False,Journal of structural biology,False
