Active control is reduced to the hip strategy, and passive mechanical stability depends on the curvature of the prosthetic foot under load. Mediolateral roll-over curvatures of prosthetic feet are largely unknown. In this study we determined the mediolateral roll-over characteristics of various prosthetic feet and foot-shoe combinations. Characteristics were determined by means of an inverted pendulum-like apparatus. The relationship between the centre of pressure (CoP) and the shank angle was measured and converted to roll-over shape and effective radius of curvature. Further, hysteresis (i.e., lagging in CoP displacement due to material compliance or slip) at vertical shank angle was determined from the hysteresis curve. Passive mechanical stability varied widely, though all measured foot-shoe combinations were relatively compliant. Mediolateral motion of the CoP ranged between 4 mm and 40 mm, thereby remaining well within each foot's physical width. Derived roll-over radii of curvature are also small, with an average of 102 mm. Hysteresis ranges between 20% and 115% of total CoP displacement and becomes more pronounced when adding a shoe. This may be due to slipping of the foot core in its cosmetic cover, or the foot in the shoe. Slip may be disadvantageous for balance control by limiting mediolateral travel of the CoP. It may therefore be clinically relevant to eliminate mediolateral slip in prosthetic foot design.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet, there is no direct evidence as to whether leaning the bicycle or conversely, attempting to minimize lean, affects maximal power output during sprint cycling. Here, we modified a cycling ergometer so that it can lean from side to side but can also be locked to prevent lean. This modified ergometer made it possible to compare maximal 1-s crank power during non-seated, sprint cycling under three different conditions: locked (no lean), ad libitum lean, and minimal lean. We found that leaning the ergometer ad libitum did not enhance maximal 1-s crank power compared to the locked condition. However, trying to minimize ergometer lean decreased maximal 1-s crank power by an average of 5% compared to leaning ad libitum. IMU-derived measures of ergometer lean provided evidence that subjects leaned the ergometer away from the downstroke pedal during the ad-lib condition, as in overground cycling. This finding suggests that our ergometer provides a suitable emulation of bicycle-lean dynamics. Overall, we find that leaning a cycle ergometer ad libitum does not enhance maximal power output, but conversely, trying to minimize lean impairs maximal power output.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the choice of STFT parameters may affect the estimation of myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue. Here, we determine the effect of window length and overlap selections on the frequency slope and the coefficient of variation from EMG spectrum features in fatiguing contractions. We also determine whether STFT parameters affect the relationship between frequency slopes and task failure. Eighty-eight healthy adult men performed one-leg heel-rise until exhaustion. A factorial design with a window length of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ms with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90% of overlap was used. The frequency slope was non-linearly fitted as a task failure function, followed by a dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. The STFT parameters elicited five patterns. A small window length produced a higher slope frequency for the peak frequency (p < 0.001). The contrary was found for the mean and median frequency (p < 0.001). A larger window length elicited a higher slope frequency for the mean and peak frequencies. The largest frequency slope and dispersion was found for a window length of 50 ms without overlap using peak frequency. A combination of 250 ms with 50% of overlap reduced the dispersion both for peak, median, and mean frequency, but decreased the slope frequency. Therefore, the selection of STFT parameters during dynamic contractions should be accompanied by a mechanical measure of the task failure, and its parameters should be adjusted according to the experiment's requirements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) rupture, especially when compounded by dorsal intercarpal ligament (DIC) and long radiolunate ligament (LRL) disruption, can cause carpal bone kinematic abnormalities. It is essential to delineate the role of these ligaments and their constraints on wrist range-of-motion (ROM) and center of rotation (COR). Wrist ROM and COR location were determined in 9 specimens using a six degree-of-freedom robotic musculoskeletal simulator in 24 directions of wrist motion for four experimental conditions: intact, and after sequential sectioning of the SLIL, DIC, and LRL. Sectioning the SLIL alone did not change wrist ROM in any direction (p > 0.10), while sectioning the SLIL and both the DIC and LRL caused significant increases in radial deviation, radial-extension, and ulnar-flexion ROM (p < 0.05). The COR of the intact wrist was located between the proximal third and middle third of the capitate, depending on the direction of wrist motion. While SLIL sectioning alone did not affect the COR, subsequent DIC sectioning led to a distal shift of COR in motions involving ulnar-extension relative to the intact condition. Additional sectioning of the LRL caused a proximal shift of COR in motions involving radial-flexion. A proximal shift implies a more dominant role of the radiocarpal joint, while a distal shift of the COR implies an increased role for the midcarpal joint. Understanding the role of ligaments on overall wrist mechanics is critical to devising new treatment strategies to restore wrist function.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the present study, we investigate how simulated advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and materials heterogeneity affect crack growth trajectory in human cortical bone. We used a phase field fracture framework on 2D models of cortical microstructure created from human tibias to analyze crack propagation. The increased AGEs level results in a higher rate of crack formation. The simulations also indicate that the mismatch between the fracture properties (e.g., critical energy release rate) of osteons and interstitial tissue can alter the post-yielding behavior. The results show that if the critical energy release rate of cement lines is lower than that of osteons and the surrounding interstitial matrix, cracks can be arrested by cement lines. Additionally, activation of toughening mechanisms such as crack merging and branching depends on bone microstructural morphology (i.e., osteons geometrical parameters, canals, and lacunae porosities). In conclusion, the present findings suggest that materials heterogeneity of microstructural features and the crack-microstructure interactions can play important roles in bone fragility.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Each specimen was tested on a biaxial testing device and the resulting stress-strain response was fitted to a four-parameter Fung constitutive model. We postulate that the inter-patient variability (differences between patients) blurs possible intra-patient variability (regional heterogeneity) and, thus, that both effects must be considered to shed light on the role of heterogeneity in aneurysm progression. We propose, demonstrate, and discuss two techniques to assess differences by, first, comparing conventional biomechanical properties and, second, the overall constitutive response. Results show that both inter- and intra-patient variability contribute to errors when using population averaged models to fit individual tissue behaviour. When inter-patient variability was accounted for and its effects excluded, intra-patient heterogeneity could be assessed, showing a wide degree of heterogeneity at the individual patient level. Furthermore, the right lateral region (from the patient's perspective) appeared different (stiffer) than the other regions. We posit that this heterogeneity could be a consequence of maladaptive remodelling due to altered loading conditions that hastens microstructural changes naturally occurring with age. Further validation of these results should be sought from a larger cohort study.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The prosthesis allows the passage of air from the trachea to the esophagus, thereby promoting the flow-induced vibration of the subject's pharyngoesophageal segment. In turn, the pharyngoesophageal segment modulates the air flow from the lungs into the subject's vocal tract, acting as an alternative source of acoustic energy to generate voice. The vibration of the pharyngoesophageal segment will likely depend on the aerodynamic forces acting on its wall, which will be defined by the flow characteristics downstream from the valve's outlet. Previous works have investigated the pressure drop across different prosthesis designs with both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Nevertheless, the aerodynamic aspects of the flow in the tracheoesophageal region have only been investigated experimentally in an idealized geometry. This work investigates the influence of the prosthesis position on the aerodynamic behavior of the pharyngoesophageal segment in terms of wall pressure distribution and characteristics of the velocity field. The investigations were carried out with a static model of the tracheoesophageal region based on the finite volume method and a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solver. The geometry of the system was based on computed tomography images obtained from laryngectomized subjects during phonation at different voice registers and included the geometry of a commercially available voice prosthesis. The results suggest that the position and angulation of the voice prosthesis have a minor influence on the pressure loss along the tracheoesophageal segment and on the pressure distribution on the pharyngoesophageal segment's wall.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, it is difficult to obtain strains that are suitable for cells without conducting multiple trials. This study develops a device that increases the strain gradient by changing the tensile section, in order to determine the effect of various cyclic strains on cultured human keratinocytes (HK) cells. This device is used to determine the effect of 3% and 5% cyclic strain and shear strain on cell proliferation and arrangement at 1 Hz. The results show that compared with static and 3% strain, a 5% cyclic strain better inhibits the proliferation of HK cells. Compared to the initial cell attachment when there is no specific directionality, the cells are aligned in the vertical stretching direction after cyclic stretching. This equipment increases the efficiency of the experiment and more intuitively maps the cell behavior and shape to the strain field and the response to the shear strain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To counteract the wind problem, the International Ski Federation has introduced a wind compensation system in 2009: time-averaged wind velocity components tangential to the landing slope are obtained from several sites along the landing slope, and these data are used in a linear statistical model for estimating the jump length effect of wind. This is considered in the total score of the ski jump. However, it has been shown that the jump length effect estimates can be inaccurate and misleading. The present article introduces an alternative mathematical wind compensation approach that is based on an accurate mechanistic model of the flight phase. This estimates the jump length effect as difference between the jump length of the real ski jump at the given wind condition and the computed jump length of the simulated ski jump at calm wind. Inputs for the computer simulation are the initial flight velocity and aerodynamic coefficients of the real ski jump that can be obtained from kinematic and wind velocity data collected during the flight. The initial flight velocity is readily available from the kinematic data and inverse dynamics can be used to compute the aerodynamic coefficients. The accuracy of the estimated jump length effect of the mechanistic model-based approach depends only on the measurement errors in the kinematic and wind velocity data, but not on inaccuracies of an approach that is based on a linear statistical model.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Coupling is typically assessed using the transfer coefficient (TC) or the vector coding (VC) approach. However, a thorough comparison of both methods regarding their interpretation, sensitivity to testing conditions and information regarding coupling strength as one overall coupling score is missing. This study aimed to compare both methods regarding a) their coupling patterns, b) their sensitivity to footwear conditions and c) to discuss both coupling approaches regarding an overall coupling score. 3D motion capture data was collected of 10 males running on a treadmill with and without shoes. Rearfoot frontal and tibia transverse plane motion was analyzed. Discrete kinematic variables and relative coupling variables were calculated via the TC and VC approach for the landing and push-off phase. A novel variable, the coupling score, was developed and calculated using both coupling methods. Coupling variables calculated with both methods showed differences in coupling patterns, especially for the landing phase (TC ≈ 0.5/in-phase towards rearfoot-phase, VC ≈ 300°/anti-phase). VC offers further details, such as coupling frequencies, compared to the TC. Moreover, both methods were unable to distinguish between footwear conditions regarding their coupling patterns or coupling scores. Strong correlations (r ≤ 0.7, p < 0.0125) between coupling scores assessed with either method suggest that both methods contain similar information regarding coupling strength. The coupling score represents a first attempt to quantify a weighted coupling pattern quantitatively. Future studies have to validate whether the coupling score might be linked to injury risks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, in addition to the fact that there is no consensus in the literature regarding age group division, such design critically influences the interpretation of the effects attributed to aging. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility to distinguish different age groups from the 3D kinematic variables of breathing motion (i.e., markers' coordinate as a function of time allowing the calculation of compartmental volume variations) and to analyze whether the aging could influence these variables. Seventy-three physically active women aged 19-80 years performed quiet breathing and vital capacity maneuvers. To record the thoracoabdominal breathing motion, the 3D coordinates of 32 retroreflective markers positioned on the trunk were used to estimate the volume variation of the superior thorax, inferior thorax, and abdomen. The percentage of contribution and the correlation coefficient were calculated to analyze the breathing motion pattern from the estimated volumes. The k-means cluster analysis was performed to analyze the age group classification. Linear regression was performed to investigate whether age can predict changes in the breathing motion pattern. The results showed that physically active women could not be classified into age groups from breathing motion. Despite significant p values of the linear regression, the high variability of the data suggested that age itself is not enough to predict the changes in breathing motion pattern when non-sedentary women are considered.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aims of this study were to (1) develop an automated tool for creating OpenSim models with subject-specific tibial torsion and femoral NSA and AVA, (2) evaluate the femoral component, and (3) release the tool open-source. The Torsion Tool (https://simtk.org/projects/torsiontool) is a MATLAB-based tool that requires an individual's tibial torsion, NSA and AVA estimates as input and rotates corresponding bones and associated muscle points of a generic musculoskeletal model. Performance of the Torsion Tool was evaluated comparing femur bones as personalised with the Torsion Tool and scaled generic femurs with manually segmented bones as golden standard for six typically developing children and thirteen children with cerebral palsy. The tool generated femur geometries closer to the segmentations, with lower maximum (-19%) and root mean square (-18%) errors and higher Jaccard indices (+9%) compared to generic femurs. Furthermore, the tool resulted in larger improvements for participants with higher NSA and AVA deviations. The Torsion Tool allows an automatic, fast, and user-friendly way of personalising femoral and tibial geometry in an OpenSim musculoskeletal model. Personalisation is expected to be particularly relevant in pathological populations, as will be further investigated by evaluating the effects on simulation outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, it is important to understand the limitations of using musculoskeletal models to study individuals. This paper describes a method of measuring in vivo gracilis muscle-tendon unit length and presents a comparison of experimental data versus predictions from four musculoskeletal models in OpenSim. The largest errors occurred when the knee was fully extended. At this position, the absolute average muscle-tendon unit length error was 7% and the absolute average fiber length error was between 15% and 32%. However, the variability of these errors was significant. Manual linear scaling based on an anthropometric database did not capture the variability observed in subjects.

This evokes the classic experiment of Reynolds on transition to turbulence in a straight pipe, which can be delayed, apparently indefinitely, if special care is taken to control for external influences. Such idealized experiments are, however, extremely difficult to perform and, in the context of cardiovascular modeling, belie the ""noise"" inherent in typical experimental and physiological systems. Previous high-fidelity CFD of a canonical eccentric (i.e., non-axisymmetric) stenosis model showed transition occurring for steady flow at Re ~ 700-800, with modest delay caused by the introduction of shear-thinning rheology. On the other hand, recent experimental measurements of steady flowing blood and blood-mimicking fluids in this same stenosis model report transition for Re ~ 400-500. Taking a cue from the FDA nozzle controversy, the present study demonstrates that the addition of small-magnitude random noise at the inlet brings the eccentric-stenosis CFD results more in-line with experiments, and reveals a more gradual transition towards turbulence. This highlights that, even in non-axisymmetric idealized geometries, unnaturally ""clean"" high-fidelity CFD may impede not only good agreement with experiments, but also understanding of the onset and character of blood flow instabilities as they may exist, naturally, in the vasculature.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This has led to the development of many multi-segment foot models for both kinematic and kinetic analyses. These models differ in the number of segments analyzed, bony landmarks identified, required marker set, defined anatomical axes and frames, the convention used to calculate joint rotations and the determination of neutral positions or other offsets from neutral. Many of these models lack validation. The terminology used is inconsistent and frequently confusing. Biomechanical and clinical studies using these models should use established references and describe how results are obtained and reported. The International Society of Biomechanics has previously published proposals for standards regarding kinematic and kinetic measurements in biomechanical research, and in this paper also addresses multi-segment foot kinematics modeling. The scope of this work is not to prescribe a particular set of standard definitions to be used in all applications, but rather to recommend a set of standards for collecting, calculating and reporting relevant data. The present paper includes recommendations for the overall modeling and grouping of the foot bones, for defining landmarks and other anatomical references, for addressing the many experimental issues in motion data collection, for analysing and reporting relevant results and finally for designing clinical and biomechanical studies in large populations by selecting the most suitable protocol for the specific application.

With this multicentre study we examined whether the assessment of stability recovery performance using two different forward lean-and-release test protocols is reliable in adults over a wide age range. Ninety-seven healthy adults (age from 21 to 80 years) were randomly assigned to one out of two lean angle protocols: gradual increase to maximal forward-lean angle (maximal lean angle; n = 43; seven participants were excluded due to marker artefacts) or predefined lean angle (single lean angle; n = 26; 21 participants needed to be excluded due to multiple stepping after release or marker artefacts). Both protocols were repeated after 0.5 h and 48 h to investigate intra- and inter-session reliability. Stability recovery performance was examined using the margin of stability at release (MoSRL) and touchdown (MoSTD) and increase in base of support (BoSTD). Intraclass correlation coefficients (confidence intervals at 95%) for the maximal lean angle and for the single lean angle were respectively 0.93 (0.89-0.96) and 0.94 (0.89-0.97) in MoSRL, 0.85 (0.77-0.91) and 0.67 (0.48-0.82) in MoSTD and 0.88 (0.81-0.93) and 0.80 (0.66-0.90) in BoSTD, with equivalence being revealed for each parameter between all three measurements (p < 0.01).

Recent advances in understanding pathogenesis, improving diagnostics and developing new treatment methods for these conditions result from an interdisciplinary approach to the problem - linking clinical sciences, basic medical sciences and hemodynamical analyses. Most common techniques used in such studies include computational fluid dynamics, which allows for development of 3D models of cerebral vasculature, basing on radiological studies. However, these methods remain flawed, mainly because of their spatial resolution, which is not high enough to visualize the smallest arterial branches (perforating branches) in the models. That leaves the perforators (<1.0 mm) out of most of the contemporary studies, whilst their clinical importance is widely recognized in clinical practice. Obstruction of these vessels by atherosclerotic plaques, thrombi or implantation of flow diverting stents may result in neurological complications such as paralysis or coma. Our research team has recently developed a new method of creating 3D models of the cerebral arterial system based on anatomical specimens and micro computed tomography (micro-CT). We have infused fresh brainstem vasculature specimens with contrast medium, subsequently scanned them using an industrial-grade micro-CT system and finally, created spatial models, which included branches of diameter less than 0.1 mm.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fixation efficacy of 3D printed vertebra clamps during routine application and to present and evaluate a novel clamp for sacrum fixation. Further, public access to the template files is provided. 98 human single-level cadaveric specimens were biomechanically tested in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), axial rotation (AR), anteroposterior shear (AS), lateral shear (LS) and axial compression-decompression (AC). Loading amplitudes were +/-7.5 Nm for FE, LB and AR, +/- 150 N for AS and LS and + 400/-100 N for AC. The novel sacrum clamp was used in 8 specimens. The median relative motion between clamps and specimens was 0.6° in FE, 0.7° in LB, 0.3° in AR, 0.5 mm in AS, 0.5 mm in LS and 0.1 mm in AC. With sacrum clamps, the median relative motion was 0.3° in FE, 0.1° in LB, 0.08° in AR, 0.8 mm in AS, 0.7 mm in LS and 0.2 mm in AC. The vertebra clamps used during routine testing provided better stability compared to the values in the literature in all six loading directions (p < 0.05).

We expected that after RTSA, participants would decrease scapulothoracic upward rotation angular displacement and increase the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) vs. before RTSA. 11 RTSA patients (12 shoulders) participated in this study before and after RTSA while optical motion capture measured kinematics of the humerus and scapula relative to the thorax. Angular kinematics were compared pre vs. post-RTSA within-participant using One Dimensional Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) t-tests (α = 0.05) and across-participants, using paired t-tests (α = 0.05) adjusted for multiple comparisons. As a group, during arm elevation with neutral rotation, the mean (SD) SHR pre-RTSA was 1.5 (0.5) and increased to 1.7 (0.3) post-RTSA, though, not significantly (p = 0.182). In contrast, during arm elevation with external rotation, the mean (SD) SHR pre-RTSA was 1.3 (0.4) and significantly increased (p = 0.018) post-RTSA to 1.7 (0.3). Likewise, during arm elevation with internal rotation, the mean (SD) SHR pre-RTSA was 1.2 (0.3) and significantly increased (p < 0.001) post-RTSA to 1.7 (0.2). In addition to these and other group trends, participant-specific patterns were uncovered through SPM analyses - with some participants significantly increasing and others significantly decreasing scapulothoracic angular displacements across humerothoracic elevation ranges. Both before and after RTSA, scapulohumeral rhythm ratios were within the range of those previously reported in post-RTSA patients and were smaller than those used by healthy populations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Mechanical stimulation through bioreactor culture may mimic these conditions to direct cartilage tissue engineering in vitro. Mechanical cues can promote chondrocyte homeostasis or hypertrophy and mineralization, depending potentially on the timing of load application. Here, we tested the effects of chondrogenic priming duration on the response of engineered human cartilage constructs to dynamic mechanical compression. We cultured human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) in fibrin hydrogels under chondrogenic priming conditions for periods of 0, 2, 4, or 6 weeks prior to two weeks of either static culture or dynamic compression. We measured construct mechanical properties, cartilage matrix composition, and gene expression. Dynamic compression increased the equilibrium and dynamic modulus of the engineered tissue, depending on the duration of chondrogenic priming. For priming times of 2 weeks or greater, dynamic compression enhanced COL2A1 and AGGRECAN mRNA expression at the end of the loading period, but did not alter total collagen or glycosaminoglycan matrix deposition. Load initiation at priming times of 4 weeks or less repressed transient osteogenic signaling (RUNX2, OPN) and expression of CYR61, a YAP/TAZ-TEAD-target gene. No suppression of osteogenic gene expression was observed if loading was initiated after 6 weeks of in vitro priming, when mechanical stimulation was observed to increase the expression of type X collagen. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the duration of in vitro chondrogenic priming regulates the cell response to dynamic mechanical compression and suggests that early loading may preserve chondrocyte homeostasis while delayed loading may support cartilage maturation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigates whether the stability threshold, reflecting the upper limits in trunk neuromuscular control, is sensitive to pain and disability and is safe to assess in low back pain (LBP) patients. Seventy-nine subjects with non-specific LBP balanced on a robotic seat while rotational stiffness was gradually reduced. The critical rotational stiffness, KCrit, that marked the transition between stable and unstable balance was used to quantify the individual's stability threshold. The effects of current pain, 7-day average pain, and disability on KCrit were assessed, while controlling for age, sex, height, and weight. Adverse events (AEs) recorded at the end of the testing session were used to assess safety. Current pain and 7-day average pain were strongly associated with KCrit (current pain p < 0.001, 7-day pain p = 0.023), reflecting that people experiencing more pain have poorer trunk neuromuscular control. There was no evidence that disability was associated with KCrit, although the limited range in disability scores in subjects may have impacted the analysis. AEs were reported in 13 out of 79 total sessions (AE Severity: 12 mild, 1 moderate; AE Relatedness: 1 possibly, 11 probably, 1 definitely-related to the study). Stability threshold is sensitive to pain and appears safe to assess in people with LBP, suggesting it could be useful for identifying trunk neuromuscular impairments and guiding rehabilitation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A split-belt treadmill (SBTM) can be used to provoke changes in step length symmetry (SLsym) and may produce a similar response in KJCF symmetry (KJCFsym) between limbs. The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of employing a SBTM walking paradigm to alter KJCF and KJCFsym and to determine if changes in SLsym coincided with changes in KJCFsym. Twenty healthy individuals performed a standardized SBTM protocol, where baseline and post-adaptation conditions had tied belt speeds of 0.5 m/s and the split-adaptation condition used a 3:1 belt speed ratio. OpenSim techniques were used to produce normalized, averaged stance phase peak KJCF during baseline walking, early- and late-adaptation, and post-adaptation. SLsym and KJCFsym values were determined. Comparisons were made for symmetry values between early- and late-adaptation and between baseline and post-adaptation. SLsym and KJCFsym did not respond in the same manner during the walking conditions. While step lengths (SL) were asymmetric during early adaptation but become more symmetric by late adaptation (p < 0.01), KJCF was symmetric throughout adaptation. Conversely, SL and KJCF exhibited similar responses during the baseline and post-adaptation conditions, with symmetry at baseline and asymmetry during post-adaptation (p < 0.01). In the post-adaptation condition, higher peak forces were demonstrated on the limb taking a shorter step. Results suggest a SBTM program may alter KJCF and KJCFsym between limbs. Furthermore, a comparison between baseline and post-adaptation may be more appropriate for evaluating the relationship between SL and KJCF.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Water has a crucial role in bone biomineralization. We developed a 3D random walk model to investigate the water diffusion process within the MCF for three different scenarios, namely low, intermediate and high mineral volume fraction. The MCF geometric model is obtained after applying 6·106 translational and rotational perturbations to an ordered arrangement of mineral. Subsequently, we compute 300 random trajectories of water molecules within the MCF for each mineral volume fraction. Every trajectory is constituted of up to 500 k positions of the water particle. We determined the diffusion coefficient from the linear fit of the mean squared displacement of water molecules as a function of time. We investigate changes in the diffusivity values in relation to variation of bone mineral content. The analysis performed on the random walk data, for all mineralization conditions, leads to diffusion coefficients in good agreement with the diffusivity outcomes achieved from previous experimental studies. Thus, the 3D geometrical configuration adopted in this numerical study appears suitable for modelling the MCF with different volume fractions, from hypo- to hyper-mineralized conditions. We observed that low mineral content is associated with an increase of the water diffusion, while lower values of diffusivity are determined in hypermineralized conditions. In agreement with experimental data, our results highlight the influence of the structural alterations on the mass transport properties.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the presence of the stent alters local blood flow and shear stresses on the surrounding arterial wall, which can cause adverse tissue responses and increase the risk of adverse outcomes. There is a need for optimization of stent designs for hemodynamic performance. We used multi-objective optimization to identify ideal combinations of design variables by assessing potential trade-offs based on common hemodynamic indices associated with clinical risk and mechanical performance of the stents. We studied seven design variables including strut cross-section, strut dimension, strut angle, cell alignment, cell height, connector type and connector arrangement. Optimization objectives were the percentage of vessel area exposed to adversely low time averaged WSS (TAWSS) and adversely high Wall Shear Stress (WSS) assessed using computational fluid dynamics modeling, as well as radial stiffness of the stent using FEA simulation. Two multi-objective optimization algorithms were used and compared to iteratively predict ideal designs.

Accordingly, time-dependent tangential ground reaction forces likely produce a diverse range of slipping foot mechanics when traction is lost, thus requiring flexible recovery strategies to prevent falls. However, previous research has focused on slip onset in early stance, often with experimental anteroposterior constraints on the slipping foot, despite the diversity of environmental slips and falls. This study aimed to determine the effects of slip onset time on slip direction, severity (distance and velocity), and compensatory stepping responses. Ten young adults received slipping perturbations at different times during the stance phase of walking via a wearable device that reduces available friction while allowing the slipping foot to slide freely within the horizontal plane. Slip direction, distance, and peak velocity, compensatory step direction and distance, and upper body angular momentum magnitude and plane of rotation were derived from kinematic data. All outcome measurements significantly correlated with the time of slip onset. Slip direction and the plane of rotation of angular momentum deviated widely from the sagittal plane, exhibiting laterally-directed components exceeding those in the anteroposterior direction. As slip onset occurred later in stance, slip severity decreased while compensatory steps became longer and progressed from a posterior to anterior placement. These results provide insight into critical times within stance when slips are most severe, and into the diversity of slipping mechanics caused by changes in slip onset time.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These systems consist of components including pedicle screws, rods, hooks, and various connectors that allow the surgeon to create constructs that can be affixed to a wide range of spinal anatomy. During the development and regulatory clearance process, TPSSs are subjected to mechanical testing such as static and dynamic compression bending per ASTM F1717, axial and torsional grip testing per ASTM F1798, and foam block pullout testing per ASTM F543. In this study, design and mechanical testing data were collected from 200 premarket notification (510(k)) submissions for TPSSs submitted to FDA between 2007 and 2018. Data were aggregated for the most commonly performed mechanical tests, and analyses were conducted to assess differences in performance based on factors such as component type, dimensions, and materials of construction. Rod material had a significant impact on construct stiffness in static compression bending testing with cobalt chromium rods being significantly stiffer than titanium rods of the same diameter. Pedicle screw type had an impact on compression bending yield strength with monoaxial screws having significantly higher yield strength as compared to polyaxial or uniplanar screws. Axial and torsional gripping capacities between components and the rods were significantly lower for cross-connectors than the other component types.

The purpose of this study was to apply a markerless motion capture approach to extract lower limb angles in the sagittal plane during the vertical jump and to evaluate agreement between the custom trained model and gold standard motion capture. We performed this study using a large open source data set (N = 84) that included synchronized commercial video and gold standard motion capture. We split these data into a training set for model development (n = 69) and test set to evaluate capture performance relative to gold standard motion capture using coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) (n = 15). We found very strong agreement between the custom trained markerless approach and marker-based motion capture within the test set across the entire movement (CMC > 0.991, RMSE < 3.22°), with at least strong CMC values across all trials for the hip (0.853 ± 0.23), knee (0.963 ± 0.471), and ankle (0.970 ± 0.055). The strong agreement between markerless and marker-based motion capture provides evidence that markerless motion capture is a viable tool to extend data collection to outside of the laboratory.

These use intermittent spinal distractions to maintain correction and allow for growth. It is unknown how much spinal distraction can be applied safely. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical and biomechanical literature to identify such safety limits for the pediatric spine. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Three systematic searches were performed including in-vivo, ex-vivo and in-silico literature. Study quality was assessed in all studies and data including patient- or specimen characteristics, distraction magnitude and spinal failure location and ultimate force at failure were collected. Twelve studies were included, 6 in-vivo, 4 ex-vivo and 2 in-silico studies.

In the ex-vivo studies (only cervical spines), segment C0-C2 was strongest, with decreasing strength in more distal segments. Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that ultimate force at birth is 300-350 N, which increases approximately 100 N each year until adulthood. Ex-vivo and in-silico studies showed that yielding occurs at 70-90% of ultimate force, failure starts at the junction between endplate and intervertebral disc, after which the posterior- and anterior long ligament rupture.

This damage is exhibited as a softening in the mechanical behavior of tissues. In this work, alteration of the collagen network is treated as the origin of damage and loss of stiffness. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of the collagen network, the mechanical properties of collagenous tissues are connected to model parameters. Softening of esophageal and arterial tissues under directional cyclic loading is investigated to determine evolution of the associated material parameters through damage progress. An evolution law is proposed which predicts the mechanical behavior of tissues after excessive deformations. Various deformation measures are examined as the damage parameter to determine the most appropriate one for general 3D loading. It is observed that, if the Green-Lagrange strain in the direction of the fibers is used as the damage parameter, the proposed law well describes the evolution of the collagen network's stiffness. The results not only facilitate prediction of the deformation-induced damage under supra-physiological deformations but also are useful for surgeons in better planning of surgical procedures and stents design.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Obstacle negotiation increases the risk of tripping and falling in PD. Being physically active can improve gait control and the ability to negotiate obstacles while walking under fatigue state. We thus determined the effects of Parkinson's disease, fatigue, and level of physical activity on gait during the approach to and crossing an obstacle during gait. Forty participants were stratified to people with Parkinson's disease active and inactive, and control individuals active and inactive. Participants walked on an 8 m walkway and stepped over an obstacle placed at the middle (4 m). They performed three trials before and after repeated sit-to-stand (rSTS)-induced fatigue state. Maximum voluntary force was assessed before and after rSTS. We measured the length, width, duration, and velocity of the approach (stride before obstacle) and crossing (step over the obstacle) phases and the leading and trailing placements and clearance during crossing phase. Fatigue trait was determined by multidimensional fatigue inventory. Before rSTS, people with Parkinson's disease inactive vs. other subgroups approached the obstacle using 18-28% shorter, wider and slower steps and crossed the obstacle slower (all p < 0.04). After rSTS, people with Parkinson's disease inactive increased (23-34%) stride length and velocity and decreased (-21%) the step width (p < 0.01).

Obesity is osteoprotective in adults, but we know very little about the effects of obesity on the growing skeleton, particularly its ability to adapt to load. The objective of this research is to assess bone mechanoadaptation in adolescent obese mice. Ten mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) from 4 to 16 weeks of age, while a control group of the same size received a normal diet (ND). At 14 weeks of age, right tibiae were cyclically loaded with a 12 N peak load for HFD mice and a 9 N peak load for ND mice three times a week for two weeks, resulting in equal peak strains of about 2500 microstrain. At 16 weeks of age, mice were sacrificed, and tibiae and gonadal fat pads were dissected. Fat pads were weighed as an obesity indicator, and tibiae were imaged with microCT to measure bone structure. The left tibiae (nonloaded) were subsequently decalcified, stained with osmium, and scanned to quantify marrow fat. Results showed that HFD mice had larger tibial cross-sectional areas compared to ND mice, as well as greater marrow adiposity.

The objectives were to evaluate the analytical model's ability to capture the behavior of the implant system and to assess its effectiveness in minimising the effects of the system's geometry on the ASC scores. The models were developed on ABAQUS®, they consisted of the implant, abutment, screw, base support and impact rod. The models relied on frictional contact definitions between the system's components. The simplified ""three-part"" model had the implant, abutment and screw merged as one part while the ""five-part"" model treated them as separate components. Different interface conditions were simulated (friction coefficient range: 0-0.9) for three abutment lengths (6, 9 and 12 mm). The simulation output was the average nodal acceleration response of the rod, which was imported to the custom ASIST program in Mathematica® to obtain the ASC scores.

In this work, we describe the public release of a software toolbox having the following design objectives: accomplish the pre-processing tasks of file input, image registration, denoising, and diffusion-tensor calculation; allow muscle-specific methods for defining seed points; make fiber-tract architectural measurements referenced to tendinous structures; visualize fiber tracts and other muscle structures of interest; analyze the goodness of outcomes; and provide a programming structure that allows the addition of new capabilities in future versions. The proper function of the code was verified using simulated datasets. The toolbox capabilities for characterizing human muscle structure in vivo were demonstrated in a case study. These capabilities included measurements of muscle morphology; contractile and non-contractile tissue volumes; fiber-tract length, pennation angle, curvature; and the physiological cross-sectional area,. The free public release of this software is a first step in creating of a community of users who use these tools in studies of muscle physiology and biomechanics. Users may further contribute to code development. Along with simulated and actual datasets for benchmarking, these tools will further create mechanisms for enhancing scientific rigor and developing and validating new code features. Planned future developments include additional options for image pre-processing, development of a graphical user interface, analysis of architectural patterns during muscle contraction, and integration of functional imaging data.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recent evidence suggests that gait assessment and response to levodopa medication may assist in the objective evaluation of clinical differences. In this paper, we propose a new approach for gait pattern differentiation that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on gait time series with and without the influence of levodopa medication. Wearable sensors positioned on both feet were used to acquire gait data from 14 VaP patients, 15 IPD patients, and 34 healthy subjects. An individual's gait features are affected by physical characteristics, including age, height, weight, sex, and walking speed or stride length. Therefore, to reduce bias due to intersubject variations, a multiple regression normalization approach was used to obtain gait data. Recursive feature elimination using the linear support vector machine, lasso, and random forest were applied to infer the optimal feature subset that led to the best results. CNNs were implemented by means of various hyperparameters and feature subsets. The best CNN classifiers achieved accuracies of 79.33%±6.46, 82.33%±10.62, and 86.00%±7.12 without (off state), with (on state), and with the simultaneous consideration of the effect of levodopa medication (off/on state), respectively. The response to levodopa medication improved classification performance. Based on gait time series and response to medication, the proposed approach differentiates between IPD and VaP gait patterns and reveals a high accuracy rate, which might prove useful when distinguishing other diseases related to movement disorders.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fracture movement interacts with callus and local stress and strain are influencing the reaction of the tissue cells. A linear gradient of strain was created inside a sheep tibia osteotomy using an active external fixator. The effect of different amounts of strain applied at 10 stimulation cycles/day on the occurrence of callus and on enabling osseous connection of the fragments was evaluated using micro-radiology to determine the amount of calcified new bone formation and its quality of gap bridging. A strong relation between level of strain and amount of callus was observed. Depending on the strain level different pattern of connections were seen. At the lowest investigated gap strain level of about 7% direct connection of the fragments within the gap occurred. Beyond 13% the callus only connected indirectly outside the gap. At over 36% callus did not connect the fragments anymore comparable to a situation in hypertrophic non-unions. The observed strong relation between interfragmentary strain and reduced osseous bridging may support the hypothesis that the elongation at rupture of connecting tissue plays an important role defining the upper limit for solid bridging. In planning fracture treatment, the amount of fracture mobility resulting in interfragmentary strain may play a crucial role to achieve solid healing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that a unit increase in positive but not negative net joint work requires greater muscle activation in older compared with younger adults. Healthy younger (age: 22.1 yrs, n = 19) and older adults (age: 69.8 yrs, n = 16) ascended and descended a 7° ramp at slow (~1.20 m/s) and moderate (~1.50 m/s) walking speeds while lower-extremity marker positions, electromyography, and ground reaction force data were collected. Compared to younger adults, older adults took 11% (incline) and 8% (decline) shorter strides, and performed 21% less positive ankle plantarflexor work (incline) and 19% less negative knee extensor work (decline) (all p < .05). However, age did not affect (all p > .05) the regression coefficients between the muscle activation integral and positive hip extensor or ankle plantarflexor work during ascent, nor between that and negative knee extensor or ankle dorsiflexor work during descent. With increased walking speed, muscle activation tended to increase in younger but changed little in older adults across ascent (10 ± 12% vs. -1.0 ± 10%) and descent (3.6 ± 10.2% vs. -2.6 ± 7.7%) (p = .006, r = 0.47).

Knee flexion, abduction and internal rotation angles are considered crucial biomechanical indicators of the ACL injury risk but currently are computed in a laboratory with an optical motion capture. This paper introduces an inertial measurement unit (IMU) based algorithm for knee flexion, abduction and internal rotation estimation during ACL injury risk assessment tests, including drop landing and cutting tasks. This algorithm includes a special two-step complementary-based orientation filter and a special single-pose sensor-to-segment calibration procedure. Fourteen healthy subjects performed double-leg, single-leg drop landing and cutting tasks. Each subject wore four IMUs and reflective marker clusters on their thighs and shanks. For the presented knee angles algorithm with an empirical initial segment orientation, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the estimated continuous knee flexion, abduction and internal rotation cross all the movement tasks were 1.07°, 2.87° and 2.64°, and RMSEs of the peak knee flexion and peak knee abduction errors were 1.22° and 3.82°. The knee angles algorithm was capable of estimating knee abduction and internal rotation angles during drop landing and cutting tasks, and knee flexion estimation was substantially more accurate than previously reported approaches. Additionally, we found that for the presented algorithm, the accuracy of initial segment orientation was a critical factor for knee abduction and internal rotation estimations.

They are not isolated innocuous injuries as 30-40% of people who sprain their ankles develop chronic ankle instability. Ankle instability is typically assessed under passive unloaded conditions, ignoring any potential contribution of joint loading or muscle activation to the maintenance of ankle stability. Thus, the relevance of unloaded ankle stability assessments to the evaluation of impairments in chronic ankle instability or the prediction of future ankle sprains is questionable. Ankle impedance, which quantifies the resistance to an imposed rotation, has often been used to quantify ankle stability. However, few studies have investigated impedance in the frontal plane where sprains occur, and none have systematically investigated the effect of weight-bearing on ankle impedance. The objective of this study was to determine whether weight-bearing affects frontal plane ankle impedance. We had subjects systematically alter the weight on the tested ankle, while imposed frontal plane rotations were applied to estimate the impedance. We found that ankle stiffness, the static component of impedance, increased proportionally with the weight on the ankle. This increase in stiffness was due to a combination of the increase loading on the joint and the increase in muscle activation that occurs during weight-bearing. Finally, we found that men had a greater stiffness than women over the majority of the weight-bearing range. These results highlight the importance of clinically assessing ankle stability during weight-bearing conditions to better determine the impairments in chronic ankle instability and identify those at risk for ankle sprains.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While kinematic analysis has been performed in large volume swimming pools using specific underwater motion capture systems, researchers may only have access to a land-based motion-capture system, which is not waterproof. Additionally, underwater motion capture systems may not fit within the confines of a smaller underwater treadmill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to design and analyze methodology to quantify lower limb kinematics during an aquatic treadmill session, using a land-based motion capture system. Kinematics of lower limb motion at different speeds was studied while walking on an underwater treadmill in comparison to walking on the same treadmill without water (empty tank). The effects of the presence of water on walking kinematics was analyzed and interpreted using parametric and non-parametric testing procedures. The results suggest significant influences of speed on knee and ankle angles (p < 0.05) in both dryland and aquatic scenarios. Knee and ankle angle measures revealed no significant differences between the dryland and water treadmill scenarios (p > 0.05). The increased time requirement in water for the full gait cycle found in this study indicates influence of resistive effects. This finding can be especially suited for muscle strengthening and stabilizing treatments for lower limbs. Also, a framework was developed to realize a potential methodology to use land-based motion capture cameras to successfully analyze the kinematics of gait in constrained aquatic volumes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

High speed video (150 Hz) was captured for eight sprinters in the men's 60 m final. Spatio-temporal and joint kinematic variables were calculated from the set position to the end of the first ground contact post-block exit (GC1). Normalised average horizontal external power (NAHEP) defined performance and was the dependent variable for a series of regression analyses. Clear relationships were found between GC1 NAHEP and 10-m time, 60-m time, change in velocity, acceleration and contact time in the first ground contact (r = -0.74, -0.64, 0.96, 0.91 and -0.56, respectively). Stepwise multiple linear regression of joint kinematic variables in the first ground contact revealed that trunk angle at take-off and thigh separation angle at take-off explained nearly 90% of variation in GC1 NAHEP (R2 = 0.89). The athletes' projection at take-off with a forward leaning trunk and large thigh separation is characteristic therefore of excellent initial acceleration performance and this will be a good visual guide for technical coaching instruction.

Powered prostheses aim to address these deficits by replicating the active function of the biological ankle. The purpose of this study was to determine if people with TTA alter muscle activity when walking with a powered prosthesis, and if this change relates to changes in metabolic costs. Ten individuals with TTA and 10 non-amputees walked on a treadmill while we measured metabolic cost and muscle activity from 16 lower limb muscles. Participants with TTA walked with their prescribed unpowered prosthesis and a commercial powered prosthesis (BiOM T2, Bedford, MA, USA), in random order. The integrated EMG across the gait cycle was greater with the powered prosthesis for the intact limb gluteus medius (p = 0.002) and residual limb vastus medialis (p = 0.013). There were several non-significant, moderate-to-strong correlations between changes in muscle activity and changes in metabolic cost between prostheses (p > 0.0504). Decreased muscle activity in the residual limb gluteus medius correlated with lower metabolic cost (r = 0.543). In contrast, lower metabolic cost was correlated with increased residual limb rectus femoris activity (r = -0.627) and increased co-contractions in the residual limb thigh muscles in terminal stance (r = -0.585) and late swing (r = -0.754). Overall, there were no consistent changes in muscle activity in response to the powered prosthesis.

SWE measurements on the GM muscle were performed in both paretic and contralateral legs during passive ankle dorsiflexion using a dynamometer in 11 children (mean age: 10 years 6 months) with UCP. Torque-angle and shear modulus-angle relationships were fitted using an exponential model to determine passive ankle joint and GM muscle stiffness respectively. Based on shear-modulus-angle relationship, slack angle and shear modulus of GM muscle were compared between legs. GM and Achilles tendon length were determined at rest using ultrasonography. No significant difference was found between legs for passive ankle joint (p = 0.26; 11.2%; 95 %CI: 31.9, -9.4) and GM muscle passive stiffness (p = 0.62; -4.4%; 95 %CI: 14.7, -23.4). GM shear modulus at a common angle was significantly higher on the paretic leg (p = 0.02; +56.5%; 95 %CI: 100.5, 12.6). GM slack angle on the paretic leg was significantly shifted to a more plantarflexed position (p = 0.04; +25.5%; 95 %CI: 49.7, 1.3) and this was associated with a non-significant lower muscle length compared to the contralateral leg (p = 0.05; -4.5%; 95 %CI: -0.4, -8.7).

To implement subject-specific, adaptive training to treadmill-based gait training, we developed a user-driven treadmill (UDTM) control algorithm that adjusts the user's speed in real-time. This study examines the response of individuals poststroke to the combination of UDTM control and electrical stimulation of the paretic ankle musculature to augment forward propulsion during walking. Sixteen individuals poststroke performed a randomized series of walking tasks on an instrumented split-belt treadmill at their self-selected speeds 1) with fixed speed treadmill (FSTM) control only, 2) FSTM control and paretic limb functional electrical stimulation (FES), 3) UDTM control only, and 4) UDTM control and FES. With UDTM control and FES, participants selected speeds that were 0.13 m/s faster than their speeds with fixed speed control only. This instantaneous increase is comparable to the gains in SS speed seen after 12 weeks of training with FES and fast walking with fixed speed treadmill control by Kesar and colleagues (Δ = 0.18 m/s). However, we saw no significant differences in the corresponding push-off forces or trailing limb position. Since individuals can use a variety of strategies to change their walking speeds, it is likely that the differences among individual responses obscured trends in the group average changes in mechanics. Ultimately, the combination of UDTM control and functional electrical stimulation (FES) allows individuals to increase speeds after a short exposure and may be a beneficial addition to poststroke gait training programs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The suckling process by the infant involves compression and intra-oral vacuum pressure, leading to milk expression from breast. The accumulated milk from the nipple varies depending on the milk properties and transient flow rate during the suckling cycle. Rheological studies on raw human milk indicate that milk has a non-Newtonian shear-thinning flow behavior. This study aims to investigate the effect of non-Newtonian milk on flow behavior through the breast ductal system using fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation. The results of the non-Newtonian effects on flow velocity and the volumetric flow rate of expressed milk are presented. The results show that non-Newtonian Carreau model is promising for the simulation of human milk flow through the breast ductal systems. Also, the results show that the non-Newtonian effects on the milk flow behavior appear for 30-35% of the suckling cycle.

Naturally, the loading of the liner of the acetabular component depends on the HJF acting on the artificial joint. In contrast to dynamic musculoskeletal models, static models for HJF prediction do not require motion analysis of the patient. However, patient-specific adaptability and validity of static models have to be scrutinized. In this study, a modular framework for HJF prediction using static models is introduced to compare the results of different cadaver templates that are the basis of most static and dynamic models, and different scaling laws for the patient-specific adaptation with in vivo HJF of ten patients for one-leg stance and level walking. The results revealed the significant effect of the underlying cadaver template used for the prediction of the HJF (p < 0.01). A higher degree of patient-specific scaling of the cadaver template often did not significantly reduce the prediction error. Three static models with the lowest prediction errors were compared to results of dynamic models from literature. The prediction error of the peak HJF of the static models (median absolute errors below 15% body weight in magnitude and below 5° in direction) was similar in magnitude and even smaller in direction compared to dynamic models.

Additionally, many NMs are developed from subject-specific imaging with limited soft tissue resolution in small structures such as the facet joints in the neck. Such details may be critical to enable NMs to predict tissue-level response. In the present study, the capsular joint cartilage (CJC) geometry in a contemporary NM was enhanced (M50-CJC) based on literature data. The M50-CJC was validated at the segment and full neck levels and assessed using relative facet joint kinematics (FJK), capsular ligament (CL) and intervertebral disc (IVD) strains, a relative vertebral rotation assessment (IV-NIC) and head kinematics in frontal and rear impact. The validation ratings at the segment level increased from 0.60 to 0.64, with improvements for modes of deformation associated with the facet joints, while no difference was noted at the head kinematic level. The improved CJC led to increased FJK rotation (188%) and IVD strain (152.2%,) attributed to the reduced facet joint gap. Further enhancements of the capsular joint representation or a link between the FJK and CL injury risk are recommended. Enhancements at the tissue level demonstrated a large effect on the IVD strain, but were not apparent in global metrics such as head kinematics. This study demonstrated that a biofidelic and detailed geometrical representation of the CJC contributes significantly to the predicted joint response, which is critical to investigate neck injury risk at the tissue level.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, little is known about the effects of this energy dissipation on the dynamics of running. This study utilizes a SLIP model with an additional spring-mass-damper system to study the effects of energy dissipation due to an additional wobbling mass on the self-stabilizing properties of human running. It was found that the additional spring-mass-damper system increased the self-stabilizing properties of the SLIP model and increased its robustness to perturbations.

Different material properties and geometry variations of a patient-specific airway model are analyzed in detail. The patient-specific airway geometry is obtained from MRI data. A completely rigid model is compared to two partly elastic variations with different elasticities. Furthermore, the influence of the nasal cavities and the treatment effect of a mandibular protrusion are studied. Rigid model parts are 3D-printed and elastic parts cast from silicone. The models are analyzed under the impact of a transient airflow which is realized through a computer controlled piston pump. The results suggest, that, for moderate deformations, the elasticity of the soft tissue replicate influences rather the level of the pressure drop inside the airway than the shape of the pressure curve. The same suggestion can be made for the influence of the nasal cavities. Often, the spatial location of the minimum pressure is taken as the collapse site of the airway geometry. This study demonstrates, that the spatial locations of the minimum pressure and the maximum deformation do not match. This reveals the importance of a coupled approach of soft tissue and airflow analysis in the search of the collapse site and therefore the best treatment option.

Hand models are useful for understanding the complexities of hand strength, precision movement, and the dexterity required during daily activities. Yet, generic models fail to accurately represent the entire scope of the population, while subject-specific models are labor-intensive to create. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of scaled generic models to represent the broad spectrum of strength profiles across the lifespan. We examined one hundred lateral pinch simulations using a generic model of the wrist and thumb anthropometrically scaled to represent the full range of heights reported for four ages across childhood, puberty, older adolescence, and adulthood. We evaluated maximum lateral pinch force produced, muscle control strategies, and the effect of linearly scaling the maximum isometric force. Our simulations demonstrated three main concepts. First, anthropometric scaling could capture age-dependent differences in pinch strength. Second, a generic muscle control strategy is not representative of all populations. Lastly, simulations do not employ optimal fiber length to complete a lateral pinch task. These results demonstrate the potential of anthropometrically-scaled models to study hand strength across the lifespan, while also highlighting that muscle control strategies may adapt as we age. The results also provide insight to the force-length relationship of thumb muscles during lateral pinch. We conclude that anthropometric scaling can accurately represent age characteristics of the population, but subject-specific models are still necessary to represent individuals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The moment arm of the knee-extensor mechanism was described by the moment arm of the patellar-tendon force, which acts to rotate the tibia about the instantaneous axis of rotation (screw axis) of the knee. A mobile biplane X-ray imaging system enabled simultaneous measurements of the three-dimensional movements of the femur, tibia and patella during each activity, from which the position and orientation of the screw axis and the patellar-tendon moment arm (PTMA) were determined. Mean PTMA across all activities and all participants remained nearly constant (~46 mm) from 0° to 70° of knee flexion and decreased by no more than 20% at higher flexion angles. The magnitude of the PTMA varied more substantially across individuals than across activities, indicating that the moment arm is more heavily influenced by differences in knee-joint geometry than muscle loading. Hence, PTMA measurements obtained for a given activity performed by one individual may be used with good confidence to describe the PTMA for any other activity performed by the same individual. Caution is advised when using PTMA measurements obtained from one individual to describe the moment arm in another individual even once the data are normalized by knee bone size, as the PTMA varied by as much as 13% from the mean across individuals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we found a continuous transition of mineralization architecture from the non-calcified cartilage towards the calcified cartilage. This refurbishes the classical picture of the so-called tidemark; a well-defined discontinuity at the osteochondral interface. Using focused-ion-beam SEM (FIB-SEM) on one osteochondral plug derived from a human cadaveric knee, we elucidated that the pore structure gradually varies from the calcified cartilage towards the subchondral bone plate. We identified nano-pores with radius of 10.71 ± 6.45 nm in calcified cartilage to 39.1 ± 26.17 nm in the subchondral bone plate. The extracted pore sizes were used to construct 3D pore-scale numerical models to explore the effect of pore sizes and connectivity among different pores. Results indicated that connectivity of nano-pores in calcified cartilage is highly compromised compared to the subchondral bone plate. Flow simulations showed a permeability decrease by about 2000-fold and solute transport simulations using a tracer (iodixanol, 1.5 kDa with a free diffusivity of 2.5 × 10-10 m2/s) showed diffusivity decrease by a factor of 1.5. Taken together, architecture of the nano-pores and the complex mineralization pattern in the osteochondral interface considerably impacts the cross-talk between cartilage and bone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previously, we outlined three main groups of mechanisms including: 1) mechano-destruction - i.e. additive platelet (membrane) damage; 2) mechano-activation - i.e. activation of shear-sensitive ion channels and pores; and 3) mechano-transduction - i.e. ""outside-in"" signaling via a range of transducers. Here, we report on recent advances since our original report which describes additional features of SMPA. A clear ""signature"" of SMPA has been defined, allowing differentiation from biochemically-mediated activation. Notably, SMPA is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, platelet membrane eversion, externalization of anionic phospholipids, and increased thrombin generation on the platelet surface. However, SMPA does not lead to integrin αIIbβ3 activation or P-selectin exposure due to platelet degranulation, as is commonly observed in biochemical activation. Rather, downregulation of GPIb, αIIbβ3, and P-selectin surface expression is evident. Furthermore, SMPA is accompanied by a decrease in overall platelet size coupled with a concomitant, progressive increase in microparticle generation. Shear-ejected microparticles are highly enriched in GPIb and αIIbβ3. These observations indicate the enhanced diffusion, migration, or otherwise dispersion of platelet adhesion receptors to membrane zones, which are ultimately shed as receptor-rich PDMPs. The pathophysiological consequence of this progressive shear accumulation phenomenon is an associated dyscrasia of remaining platelets - being both reduced in size and less activatable via biochemical means - a tendency to favor bleeding, while concomitantly shed microparticles are highly prothrombotic and increase the tendency for thrombosis in both local and systemic milieu. These mechanisms and observations offer direct clinical utility in allowing measurement and guidance of the net balance of platelet driven events in patients with implanted cardiovascular therapeutic devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The 3-6 nm thick mineral lamellae are arranged in stacks of 3-20 layers and curve around individual fibrils, few fibrils, and higher numbers of collagen fibrils. We evaluate the effect of these stacked mineral lamellae with various radius of curvature patterns on the elastic bending and torsional responses of bone at the sub-microscale using a finite element method. We find that the curved multi-radius stack patterns increased the bending and torsional stiffnesses by 7% and 23%, respectively, compared to when the stacks of mineral lamellae only encircle individual fibrils for the idealized geometric models considered.

In this study we evaluate an unexplored component of joint fluid transport -fluid transport between cartilage and bone. Such transport across the cartilage-bone interface could potentially provide chondrocytes with an additional source of nutrients and signaling molecules. A biphasic viscoelastic model using an ellipsoidal fiber distribution was created with three distinct layers of cartilage (superficial zone, middle zone, and deep zone) along with a layer of subchondral bone. For stress-relaxation in unconfined compression, our results for compressive stress, radial stress, and effective fluid pressure were compared with established biphasic analytical solutions. Our model also shows the development of fluid pressure gradients at the cartilage-bone interface during loading. Fluid pressure gradients that develop at the cartilage-bone interface show consistently higher pressures in cartilage following the initial loading to 10% stain, followed by convergence of the pressures in cartilage and bone during the 400 s relaxation period. These results provide additional evidence that fluid is transported between cartilage and bone during loading and improves upon estimates of the magnitude of this effect through incorporating a realistic distribution and estimate of the collagen ultrastructure. Understanding fluid transport between cartilage and bone may be key to new insights about the mechanical and biological environment of both tissues in health and disease.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We aimed to measure/compare trunk, lumbar, and pelvis primary RoMs in all anatomical planes/directions, lumbopelvic ratios (lumbar to pelvis rotations at different trunk angles) in all anatomical planes/directions and three-dimensional spine kinematics during twelve symmetric/asymmetric statics load-handling activities in healthy normal-weight and obese individuals. Kinematics/motion data were collected from nine healthy young male normal-weight and nine age/height/sex matched obese individuals via a ten-camera Vicon motion capture system. Obese individuals had significantly smaller (p < 0.05) lumbar flexion (~9° in average) and larger pelvis right lateral bending (~5°) RoMs as well as smaller lumbopelvic ratios (~37%) in lateral bending and axial rotation movements as compared to normal-weight individuals. Moreover, the two groups had generally non-significant different segmental orientations (<20° and in most cases < 10°) in load-handling tasks that depended on the magnitude of load asymmetry angle (p < 0.05). Differences were larger for tasks performed near the floor, away from body, and at larger load asymmetry angles. Biomechanical models simulating pure lateral bending, axial rotation, or tasks involving large load asymmetry may therefore need subject-specific, rather than population-based, motion analysis due to the effects from body weight.

This study investigated in vivo kinematics of the entire head-neck complex (C0-T1) of eight female asymptomatic subjects during dynamic left-right head axial rotation using a dual fluoroscopic imaging system and 3D-to-2D registration techniques. During one-sided head rotation (i.e., left or right head rotation), the primary rotation of the overall head-neck complex (C0-T1) reached 55.5 ± 10.8°, the upper cervical spine region (C0-2) had a primary axial rotation of 39.7 ± 9.6° (71.3 ± 8.5% of the overall C0-T1 axial rotation), and the lower cervical spine region (C2-T1) had a primary rotation of 10.0 ± 3.7° (18.6 ± 7.2% of the overall C0-T1 axial rotation). Coupled bending rotations occurred in the upper and lower cervical spine regions in similar magnitude but opposite directions (upper: contralateral bending of 18.2 ± 5.9° versus lower: ipsilateral bending of 21.4 ± 5.1°), resulting in a compensatory cervical lateral curvature that balances the head to rotate horizontally. Furthermore, upper cervical segments (C0-1 or C1-2) provided main mobility in different rotational degrees of freedom needed for head axial rotations. Additionally, we quantitatively described both coupled segmental motions (flexion-extension and lateral bending) by correlation with the overall primary axial rotation of the head-neck complex.

The objective of this study is to develop a posture control device and demonstrate its ability to induce multiplanar loads to the human cadaver spinal columns. The inferior end of the device was designed to allow a full six degree-of-freedom control for positioning the specimen via a coupled x-y cross table, vertical lift platform, and triaxial rotation mechanism. The superior end of the device was designed such that the cranial fixation of the specimen could be attached to the piston of the electrohydraulic testing apparatus directly or via a rotary disc through a slider-crank mechanism. The former attachment induces complex forces and moments, while the latter induces controlled moments with minimal forces. The usability of the posture control device was demonstrated by conducting experiments with a thoracolumbar spinal column for combined forces and moments, and with a head-neck column for complex moments, and in both cases, the uniaxial travel of the piston was at a dynamic rate.

Defining such criteria is challenging, as the objectives driving the optimization of human gait are unclear. This study evaluated how minimising various physiologically-based criteria (i.e., cost of transport, muscle activity, head stability, foot-ground impact, and knee ligament use) affects the predicted gait, and developed and evaluated a combined, weighted cost function tuned to predict healthy gait. A generic planar musculoskeletal model with 18 Hill-type muscles was actuated using a reflex-based, parameterized controller. First, the criteria were applied into the base simulation framework separately. The gait pattern predicted by minimising each criterion was compared to experimental data of healthy gait using coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) averaged over all biomechanical variables. Second, the optimal weighted combined cost function was created through stepwise addition of the criteria. Third, performance of the resulting combined cost function was evaluated by comparing the predicted gait to a simulation that was optimised solely to track experimental data. Optimising for each of the criteria separately showed their individual contribution to distinct aspects of gait (overall R2: 0.37-0.56; RMSE: 3.47-4.63 SD). An optimally weighted combined cost function provided improved overall agreement with experimental data (overall R2: 0.72; RMSE: 2.10 SD), and its performance was close to what is maximally achievable for the underlying simulation framework.

External knee adduction moment (KAM), a surrogate measure of knee contact force (KCF) in the medial compartment, is related to knee pain, but the association between KCF and pain severity remains unclear. This study aimed to reveal the differences in KCF due to pain severity. Twenty-eight patients with knee OA were evaluated knee symptoms including pain severity via the Knee Society Score. Based on the median symptom score, 17 points in this study, subjects were classified as having Mild symptomatic OA (n = 15) and Severe symptomatic OA (n = 13). Subjects walked three times at a comfortable speed along a six-meter walkway, and we calculated KAM during the stance phase. KCF magnitude and distribution were also computed using the subject-specific musculoskeletal model, considering physical characteristics such as the femorotibial angle measured by X-ray. No differences in physical characteristics such as femorotibial angle and gait speed were found by symptom severity, whereas KAM and medial KCF at minimum and second peak in Severe symptomatic OA patients were significantly greater than those in Mild symptomatic OA. A significant medial shift of KCF in Severe symptomatic OA was also seen at first peak and minimum. Severe symptomatic OA had a greater medial KCF and medial shift of KCF.

With the advent of artificial intelligence techniques such as deep neural networks, it is now possible to perform such analyses without markers, making outdoor applications feasible. In this paper I summarise 2D markerless approaches for estimating joint angles, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In computer science, so-called ""pose estimation"" algorithms have existed for many years. These methods involve training a neural network to detect features (e.g. anatomical landmarks) using a process called supervised learning, which requires ""training"" images to be manually annotated. Manual labelling has several limitations, including labeller subjectivity, the requirement for anatomical knowledge, and issues related to training data quality and quantity. Neural networks typically require thousands of training examples before they can make accurate predictions, so training datasets are usually labelled by multiple people, each of whom has their own biases, which ultimately affects neural network performance. A recent approach, called transfer learning, involves modifying a model trained to perform a certain task so that it retains some learned features and is then re-trained to perform a new task. This can drastically reduce the required number of training images. Although development is ongoing, existing markerless systems may already be accurate enough for some applications, e.g. coaching or rehabilitation. Accuracy may be further improved by leveraging novel approaches and incorporating realistic physiological constraints, ultimately resulting in low-cost markerless systems that could be deployed both in and outside of the lab.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies consider average or peak values to quantify asymmetries, however this approach does not consider the pattern of movement like velocity profiles. Here we demonstrate that conducting a functional analysis of variance (FANOVA) permits to quantify asymmetries in bench press performance by Paralympic powerlifting at different submaximal intensities. Kinematic data were collected from 10 Paralympic powerlifting athletes performing in bench press at submaximal intensities (50% and 90% of the one-repetition maximum). Linear velocity was quantified considering mean values and the entire waveform. Mean values were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the waveforms were compared by FANOVA. FANOVA identified asymmetry profiles that ANOVA did not recognize at the highest intensity, which is the closest to a competition. This way, FANOVA can bring advantages to the analysis of competitive performance. FANOVA data analysis identifies asymmetries at higher intensity of effort considering the whole pattern of movement. Therefore, we consider that the FANOVA's approach may benefit the biomechanical assessment of the Paralympic powerlifting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

An AFO's sagittal plane rotational stiffness can affect gait kinematics. Because AFOs are often made from viscoelastic materials, their properties may vary at different walking speeds. The influence of rotational speed on AFO properties has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of rotational speed on AFO stiffness about the ankle. We tested a sample of one thermoplastic off-the-shelf AFO and two 3-D printed carbon fiber enforced nylon AFOs. Each AFO's dynamic resistance torque was measured as it was flexed at five speeds (5-100 °/s) using a custom-built measurement apparatus. We compared loading stiffness, neutral angle, and energy dissipation parameters for each AFO across speeds. Parameter values were generally greater at higher speeds. These effects were statistically significant for all AFOs (p≤0.002). However, differences in AFO stiffness and neutral angle across speeds were quite small (<0.6 Nm/° and <2.2 °). Changes in the thermoplastic AFO's stiffness were lower than the minimum detectable difference. Energy dissipation, as indicated by hysteresis area, increased by up to 6.3 J (about 250%) at the highest speed. This demonstrates that AFO flexion speed can influence the properties of different AFOs over the range typically achieved in human walking. Future work should assess whether the observed small variations of stiffness and neutral angle have a clinically meaningful impact on user performance, as well as explore effects of angular speed on a variety of AFO materials and designs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Few data have been reported on comparisons of morphological femoral condyle motions and physiological tibiofemoral cartilage contact location changes. This study compared the morphological and physiological kinematic measures of 20 knees during an in vivo weightbearing single leg lunge from full extension to 120° of flexion using a combined MRI and dual fluoroscopic imaging system (DFIS) technique. The morphological femoral condyle motion was measured using three flexion axes: trans-epicondylar axis (TEA), geometric center axis (GCA) and iso-height axis (IHA). At low flexion angles, the medial femoral condyle moved anteriorly, opposite to that of the contact points, and was accompanied with a sharp increase in external femoral condyle rotation. At 120° of flexion, the morphological measures of the lateral femoral condyle were more posteriorly positioned than those of the contact locations. The data showed that the morphological measures of femoral condyle translations and axial rotations varied with different flexion axes and did not represent the physiological articular contact kinematics.

This is possible using linear sprint testing to derive force-velocity-power outputs (in laboratory or field settings), but testing requires specific efforts and the movement assessed is not specific to the football playing tasks. This proof-of-concept short communication presents a method to derive the players' individual acceleration-speed (AS) profile in-situ, i.e. from global positioning system data collected over several football sessions (without running specific tests). Briefly, raw speed data collected in 16 professional male football players over several training sessions were plotted, and for each 0.2 m/s increment in speed from 3 m/s up to the individual top-speed reached, maximal acceleration output was retained to generate a linear AS profile. Results showed highly linear AS profiles for all players (all R2 > 0.984) which allowed to extrapolate the theoretical maximal speed and accelerations as the individual's sprint maximal capacities. Good reliability was observed between AS profiles determined 2 weeks apart for the players tested, and further research should focus on deepening our understanding of these methodological features. Despite the need for further explorations (e.g. comparison with conceptually close force-velocity assessments that require, isolated and not football-specific linear sprint tests), this in-situ approach is promising and allows direct assessment of football players within their specific acceleration-speed tasks. This opens several perspectives in the performance and injury prevention fields, in football and likely other sprint-based team sports, and the possibility to ""test players without testing them"".",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Four hundred and twenty-six subjects (158 men and 258 women; mean age 68.7 years, standard deviation (SD) 7.9 years) were included in the study. BMDs (g/cm2) of the femoral neck, trochanter, shaft, and total proximal femur were collected. Kinetic data including maximum hip power and hip power-time integral was obtained from a three-dimensional gait analysis with self-selected walking speed. Correlation between BMDs of proximal femur and gait kinetic data was analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was also performed to identify factors significantly associated with BMD. Correlation between BMD and hip kinetic data was not prominent in elderly men. In women, BMD was significantly correlated with hip kinetic data. Hip power-time integral showed greater correlation with BMD than maximum hip power during gait in elderly women. Age (p < 0.001), weight (p = 0.007) and hip power-time integral (p = 0.008) were significant factors associated with femoral neck BMD, and these factors explained 25.4% of femoral neck BMD.

This study uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the effects of different head tilt positions on sinonasal coverage, residence time and shear stresses in squeeze-bottle nasal irrigation. A sinonasal cavity computational model was constructed from a high-resolution CT scan of a healthy, 25-year-old Asian female. The Volume of Fluid method was used to track the interface between the two immiscible fluids (air and water). The direction of gravity was varied to simulate different head tilt-positions (0° Straight, 45° Forward, 45° Left, 45° Right and 45° Backward) during nasal irrigation with 150 mL liquid via a squeeze bottle through the left nostril for 2 s with a 0.1 s acceleration/deceleration time. The results showed that the 45° backward head tilt position was the most effective in delivering irrigation to the ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid sinuses. Altering head tilt had minimal impact on irrigation delivery to the maxillary sinuses. Maximum wall shear stresses seen in localized areas of the sinus mucosa varied significantly with different head tilt angles. However, the difference in mean wall shear stress on the sinus surfaces was marginal with changing head tilt position.

The study developed a gait perturbation, treadmill-based, balance assessment protocol and demonstrated that it can be used to quantify improvements in reactive balance responses among individuals post-stroke. The protocol consists of a sequence of fifteen 90-second treadmill walking trials, with a single perturbation applied during the middle third of each trial. Gait was perturbed by rapid acceleration-deceleration of the treadmill belt at mid-stance of the unaffected leg during a randomly selected gait cycle. The initial perturbation magnitude was based on the participant's maximum walking speed and increased or decreased in each trial, based on success or failure of recovery, as determined from an instrumented harness. The protocol was used before and after a 10-week period of therapy in twenty-four stroke survivors. Outcomes included maximum recoverable perturbation (MRP), self-selected gait speed, levels progressed through the algorithm, and falls versus recoveries.Participants were able to take recovery steps in response to the perturbation. Twelve participants completed the full assessment protocol before and after the therapeutic intervention. After the intervention, they had fewer falls and more recoveries (p < 0.001), progressed through more algorithm levels (p = 0.043), had a higher MRP (p = 0.005), and had higher gait speeds. The protocol was found to be feasible in stroke survivors with moderate gait deficits. The data supports the conclusion that this protocol can be used in clinical research to quantify improvements in balance during walking.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Workstations that require non-neutral postures can lead to increased load, muscular fatigue and injury risk. However, demands during simple axial rotation tasks are not well-defined. The purpose of this study is to quantify the muscular activity of during static axial rotation in a range of postures. Eighteen participants performed 76 axial rotation exertions in varying combinations of humeral elevation angles (30°-60°-90°-120°-150°), plane of elevation (30°-60°-90°-120°) and exertion intensity (20-40%). Six unilateral (right) muscles (pectoralis major (clavicular and sternal), posterior deltoid, teres major, infraspinatus, latissiumus dorsi) were monitored using surface electromyography (EMG). EMG was normalized and integrated over 2 s. The influences of elevation, plane, and intensity on activity levels were then tested with a 3-way ANOVAs (p < .05). During internal rotation, activity was highest at low elevation/high plane combinations for the internal rotators, but at high elevation/low plane combinations for the external rotators. During the 40% intensity exertions, activity levels were highest at lower elevations for internal rotator but at high elevations for the external rotators. During external rotation, as the degree of elevation increased, the activity of the external rotator muscles also increased while internal rotators were unaffected. Humeral muscles responsible for axial rotation are influenced by arm posture during axial rotation exertions. High elevation and plane combinations resulted in high demands for external rotator muscles and this should be considered for job design and injury risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Tricuspid regurgitation affects 1.6 million Americans. Approximately 43% of patients who undergo tricuspid valve repair to correct tricuspid regurgitation will develop residual pulmonary hypertension, putting them at risk for developing increased right ventricle pressures. Previous studies have quantified the forces required to cinch the tricuspid annulus by only pressurizing the right ventricle, leaving out forces from the pressurized left ventricle and septal wall unaccounted for. This study pressurized both left and right ventricles of 10 porcine hearts to their normal physiological pressures of 110 mmHg and 30 mmHg respectively, then increased right ventricular pressures to mimic moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension. A suture was anchored around the free wall of the tricuspid annulus with the free end attached to a force transducer. The force transducer was mounted on a slider system which pulled the suture at regular intervals. The cinching force on the tricuspid annulus was quantified with each annular reduction by simulating peak systole condition in both ventricles. The data was compared with only the right ventricle pressurized as previous studies did. There were significant differences in required cinching forces with each increase in right ventricular pressure and between trials that pressurized both ventricles versus only the right ventricle, suggesting adoption of this physiologically improved protocol. We also found with increased cinching of the tricuspid annulus, notable changes occur in the mitral annulus.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, growing evidence suggests that the foot may also contribute to push-off power during walking. Thus, age-related changes in foot structure and function may contribute to altered foot mechanics and ultimately reduced push-off power. The purpose of this paper was to quantify age-related differences in foot mechanical work during walking across a range of speeds and at a single fixed speed with varied demands for push-off power. 9 young and 10 older adults walked at 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 m/s, and at 1.2 m/s with an aiding or impeding horizontal pulling force equal to 5% BW. We calculated foot work in Visual3D using a unified deformable foot model, accounting for contributions of structures distal to the hindfoot's center-of-mass. Older adults walked while performing less positive foot work and more negative net foot work (p < 0.05). Further, we found that the effect of age on mechanical work performed by the foot and the ankle-foot complex increased with increased locomotor demand (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that during walking, age-related differences in foot mechanics may contribute to reduced push-off intensity via greater energy loss from distal foot structures, particularly during walking tasks with a greater demand for foot power generation. These findings are the first step in understanding the role of the foot in push-off power deficits in older adults and may serve as a roadmap for developing future low-cost mobility interventions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This specific problem is frequently encountered with the pelvis segment. This study sought to compare joint and pelvis angles computed from a pelvis-fixed local coordinate system (LCS) that was constructed from optically tracked pelvis landmarks (gold standard) and landmarks derived from angular deviations calculated from triaxial accelerometer data. One participant performed seven tasks: sitting, forward bend, sit-to-stand-to-sit, forward lunge, symmetrical squat, asymmetrical squat, and gait. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were examined for the pelvis, lumbar spine, and hip joint angles calculated using the standard and accelerometer-based methods for creating a LCS. The RMSE values for global pelvis angles ranged from 2.2° (gait; R2 = 0.47) to 4.9° (sit-to-stand-to-sit; R2 = 0.98), 0.6° (sitting; R2 = 0.88) to 7.4° (gait; R2 = 0.39), and 1.5° (forward bend; R2 = 0.99) to 2.9° (sit-to-stand-to-sit; R2 = 0.99) for motion about the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. The magnitude of error observed for adjacent joint motion was lowest about the Z axis for all tasks. In conclusion, the accelerometer-based LCS offers an alternative method for computing pelvis and adjacent joint angles without the reliance on a visual line-of-sight. For motion about the X and Y axes, time-series data derived with the accelerometer-based method may be less representative of discrete events, particularly for gait and lunging tasks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The recovery of bending strength has been shown to be a function of the rest days allowed after fatigue loading in rodents and the aim of this study was to investigate if similar results would occur under impact conditions. In this study, cyclic axial compression load was applied in vivo on the right forelimbs while left forelimbs served as controls. Two rest groups were used: one day of rest and seven days of rest. Afterwards, all ulnae were scanned using micro-Computed Tomography followed by impact testing. The micro-CT scan confirmed the formation of woven bone on loaded ulnae after seven days rest. The peak impact force was 37.5% higher in the control (mean = 174.96 ± 33.25 N) specimens compared to the loaded bones (mean = 130.34 ± 22.37 N). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy analyses suggested no significant change of chemical composition in the cortical region between the loaded and control ulnae, but woven bone region had lower carbonate and amide I content than contralateral controls (p < 0.05). We find that cyclic fatigue loading had a negative effect on bone's impact response. Bones that experienced fatigue loading became less stiff, weaker, and more prone to fracture when subjected to impact. The formation of woven bone after seven days of rest did not restore the stiffness upon impact and confirm that rest time is crucial to the recovery of fatigue damage.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, it becomes crucial to compare the effect of T2D and OP on alteration in mechanical and structural properties of femoral trabecular bone. This study investigated the effect of T2D, OP, and osteopenia on bone structural and mechanical properties using micro-CT, nanoindentation and compression test. Further, a nanoscale finite element model (FEM) was developed to predict the cause of alteration in mechanical properties. Finally, a damage-based FEM was proposed to predict the pathological related alteration of bone's mechanical response. The obtained results demonstrated that the T2D group had lower volume fraction (-18.25%, p = 0.023), young's modulus (-23.47%, p = 0.124), apparent modulus (-37.15%, p = 0.02), and toughness (-40%, p = 0.001) than the osteoporosis group. The damage-based FE results were found in good agreement with the compression experiment results for all three pathological conditions. Also, nanoscale FEM results demonstrated that the elastic and failure properties of mineralised collagen fibril decreases with increase in crystal size. This study reveals that T2D patients are more prone to fragile fracture in comparison to OP and osteopenia patients.

Furthermore, this viewpoint provides descriptions of what CoP and CoM outcomes may reflect, a discussion of recent developments in selected balance outcomes, the importance of measuring instantaneous balance outcomes, and directions for future questions/research. Considering the enormous number and cost of falls annually, conclusions drawn from this perspective underscore the need for more cohesive efforts to advance our understanding of balance performance. As we refine the technology and algorithms used to portably assess postural stability, the question of which measurement (i.e. CoP or CoM) to utilize seems to be highly dependent on the question being asked. Further, the complexity of the question appears to span multiple disciplines and cultivate exploration of the intrinsic mechanisms of stability. Recently developed multi-dimensional methods for assessing balance performance may provide additional insight into balance, improving our ability to predict balance impairments and falls outside the laboratory and in the clinic. However, additional work will be necessary to understand the clinical significance and predictive capacity of these outcomes in various fall-prone populations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The expensive processing of laboratory data associated with generating these outputs presents challenges to researchers and clinicians, including significant time and expertise requirements that limit the number of subjects typically evaluated. The objective of the current study was to develop and compare machine learning techniques for rapid, data-driven estimation of musculoskeletal metrics from derived gait lab data. OpenSim estimates of patient joint and muscle forces during activities of daily living were simulated using laboratory data from 70 total knee replacement patients and used to develop 4 different machine learning algorithms. Trained machine learning models predicted both trend and magnitude of estimated joint contact (mean correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to 0.94 during gait) and muscle forces (mean correlation coefficients ranging from 0.83 to 0.91 during gait) based on anthropometrics, ground reaction forces, and joint angle data.

Specific to the atrioventricular heart valve leaflets, the collagen fiber kinematics form the basis of many constitutive models; however, some researchers claim that modeling the affine fiber kinematics (AFK) are sufficient for accurately predicting the macroscopic tissue deformations, while others state that modeling the non-affine kinematics (i.e., fiber uncrimping together with elastic elongation) is required. Experimental verification of the AFK theory has been previously performed for the mitral valve leaflets in the left-side heart; however, this same evaluation has yet to be performed for the morphologically distinct tricuspid valve (TV) leaflets in the right-side heart. In this work, we, for the first time, evaluated the AFK theory for the TV leaflets using an integrated biaxial testing-polarized spatial frequency domain imaging device to experimentally quantify the load-dependent collagen fiber reorientations for comparison to the AFK theory predictions. We found that the AFK theory generally underpredicted the fiber reorientations by 3.1°, on average, under the applied equibiaxial loading with greater disparity when the tissue was subjected to the applied non-equibiaxial loading. Furthermore, increased AFK errors were observed with increasing collagen fiber reorientations (Pearson coefficient r = -0.36, equibiaxial loading), suggesting the AFK theory is better suited for relatively smaller reorientations. Our findings suggest the AFK theory may require modification for more accurate predictions of the collagen fiber kinematics in the TV leaflets, which will be useful in refining modeling efforts for more accurate TV simulations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that dorsal principal and shear strain patterns, magnitudes and directions would differ from proximal-to-distal; and would be similar from medial-to-lateral across each bone. Unilateral limbs from nine equine cadavers were instrumented with rosette strain gauges during limb loading to 10,500 N. Gauges were attached at seven dorsal sites: middle MC3, distal MC3 (medial, middle, lateral) and proximal P1 (medial, middle, lateral). Outcome measures were analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Distal MC3 had the greatest, and proximal P1 the smallest magnitude of minimum principal and shear strains. Directions of maximum and minimum principal strain were similar at the middle and distal MC3 sites with a 20-40° direction difference compared to proximal P1. The patterns of strain magnitude and direction were similar from medial-to-lateral on distal MC3 but varied in pattern and magnitude among the P1 sites. Overall, as load reached maximum, direction of minimum principal strain became more axial in orientation, converging from opposite directions between bones, potentially maximising stability of the distal limb. The difference in strain parameters and strain ratio for adjacent anatomic sites on distal MC3 and proximal P1 was not anticipated, in light of the anatomic congruity of the metacarpophalangeal joint. Based on the predominance of shear strain across proximal P1, shear forces are likely the predominant biomechanical contributor to sagittal fractures of P1.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Timely lateral redirection of the centre of mass (CoM) preceding the no-return position is necessary for balance. We analysed the curvature peaks (the inverse of the radius of curvature) of the three-dimensional path of the CoM during the entire stride. Twelve healthy adults walked on a force-sensorized treadmill at constant velocities from 0.4 to 1.2 m s-1, in 0.2 m s-1 increments. The three-dimensional displacements of the CoM, the muscular power sustaining the CoM motion with respect to the ground, and the efficiency of the pendulum-like transfer of the CoM were computed via the double integration of the ground reaction forces. The curvatures of the CoM trajectory were measured (Frenet-Serret formula). During the single stance, the curvature showed a bell-shaped increment, lasting a few tenths of a millisecond, and peaking at 365-683 m-1 (radius of 2.7-1.4 mm, respectively), the higher the walking velocity. The CoM was redirected towards the swinging lower limb. The curvature increment was sustained by muscle-driven braking of the CoM. Smoother increments of curvature (peaking at approximately 37-150 m-1), further orienting the CoM towards the leading lower limb, were observed during the double stance. The peaks of the curvatures were symmetric between the two sides. The high curvature peaks during the single stance may represent an index of dynamic balance during walking.

Achilles tendon overuse tendon injury generally initiate unilaterally and alters triceps surae activation and Achilles tendon properties. The investigation of inter-limb differences in muscle activation and tendon properties may provide directions for injury prevention in habitual runners. In this study triceps surae and Achilles tendon properties were investigated bilaterally in habitual runners during unilateral maximal isometric contractions. Morphological, mechanical and material Achilles tendon properties were assessed using isokinetic dynamometry, motion capture and ultrasonography while triceps surae activation strategies were assessed using electromyography. Lower limb preference was assessed for inter-limb comparisons using the Waterloo questionnaire. Zero and one-dimensional statistical analysis and Cohen's d were employed to investigate possible inter-limb differences. Inter-limb associations in Achilles tendon properties and intra-limb associations between triceps surae activations were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. No differences were observed between the preferred and non-preferred limb in terms of triceps surae muscle activation amplitude and Achilles tendon properties. However, intra-limb association among triceps surae activation ratios were not identical between limbs. Runners and triathletes present similar Achilles tendons properties between limbs, and thus initial observations of unilateral changes in the Achilles tendon properties might be used as a strategy to prevent the onset of overuse tendon injury. The non-similar associations within activation ratios between limbs should be further explored since triceps surae activation strategies may alter loading of the Achilles tendon.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although growing evidence points to the beneficial effects of BSEs, specifically in reducing low-back physical demands, there is limited understanding of potential unintended consequences of BSE use on neuromuscular control of the trunk during manual material handling (MMH). We quantified the effects of two passive BSEs (BackX™ AC and Laevo™ V2.5) on trunk dynamic stability and movement coordination during a repetitive lifting task. Eighteen participants (gender-balanced) completed four minutes of repetitive lifting in nine different conditions, involving symmetric and asymmetric postures when using the BSEs (along with no BSE as a control condition). Maximum Lyapunov exponents (short-term: λmax-s; long-term: λmax-l) and Floquet multipliers (FMmax) were respectively calculated to quantify the local dynamic and orbital stability of thorax and pelvis trajectories. Thorax-pelvis segmental coordination was also quantified using the continuous relative phase. Wearing the Laevo™ significantly increased λmax-s for the pelvis (by ~ 8%) and FMmax for the thorax and pelvis (by ~ 5-10%). Use of either BSE decreased the in-phase coordination pattern for the thorax-pelvis coupling (by ~ 15%). These results suggest that BSE use can compromise neuromuscular control of the trunk, and caution should thus be used in selecting a suitable BSE for use in a given MMH task.

We aimed to compare changes in lower limb and foot mechanics between two types of commonly used foot orthoses (FO) with a control. Twenty-seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis participated in this crossover study. Two different types of FO (a medially wedged custom-made FO and a prefabricated FO with a metatarsal dome, respectively), were compared against a control insole. During gait, lower limb mechanics were analyzed using 3D motion capture, force plates, and an in-shoe pressure system. Inverse dynamics models were created in the Anybody Modeling System to calculate joint angles and joint moments during gait. Gait variables were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. Compared to the control, the prefabricated FO had limited effect on gait mechanics. Compared to the control the custom-made FO reduced ankle plantarflexion moment with 0.4 %body weight * body height (BW * BH) between 66 and 76% of stance and ankle eversion moment was reduced 0.16% BW*BH between 3 and 40% of stance. Furthermore, it also reduced the average forefoot plantar pressure by 9 kPa between 20 and 62% of stance compared to the control. Changes in foot pressure distribution, joint moments and angles were most pronounced for custom-made FO compared to the prefabricated FO.

Aim of this study was to analyze HA pathways in subjects with unilateral and bilateral TJR and compare them to a control group. An optoelectronic system was employed to track mouth opening/closing cycles (n = 3) of 15 patients (7 operated unilaterally, 8 bilaterally, 11 F, aged 24-72) and 12 controls (6 F, aged 23-40). HA position in space was determined for 30 equally-distributed steps of the observed movement. Total mandibular rotation around HA (Φtot) and total translation along HA (Ttot) were determined. Angles between HA and the anatomical coordinate system of the head (θx, θy, θz); global fluctuation of HA spatial orientation (θe), distance between condylar center (CP) and HA (dCP) and its projections on the axes (xdCP, ydCP, zdCP) were calculated. Overall, Φtot was larger in controls than in bilaterally operated subjects (p = 0.002, p = 0.003) and θz was larger in unilaterally operated subjects than in controls (p = 0.004) and bilaterally operated subjects (p = 0.002, p = 0.024). During opening, θe¯ was smaller in controls than in unilaterally operated subjects (p = 0.01). The distance dCP was smaller for alloplastic joints than for controls (p < 0.01 overall).

However, foot morphology varies widely within the population, and changes dynamically as the foot is loaded during stance. This study presents a parametric statistical shape model from 4D foot scans to capture both the inter- and intra-individual variability in foot morphology. Thirty subjects walked on a treadmill while 4D scans of their right foot were taken at 90 frames-per second during stance phase. Each subject's height, weight, foot length, foot width, arch length, and sex were also recorded. The 4D scans were all registered to a common high-quality foot scan, and a principal component analysis was done on all processed 4D scans. Elastic-net linear regression models were built to predict the principal component scores, which were then inverse transformed into 4D scans. The best performing model was selected with leave-one-out cross-validation. The chosen model predicts foot morphology across stance phase with a root-mean-square error of 5.2 ± 2.0 mm and a mean Hausdorff distance of 25.5 ± 13.4 mm.

However, the evidence is still controversial. Most previous studies determined peak torque asymmetries, which in our understanding does not consider the pattern of movement like torque profiles. Here we demonstrate that asymmetries in pedaling torque at different exercise intensities can be better described when the torque profiles are considered using functional analysis of variance than when only the peak values are analyzed. We compared peak torques and torque curves recorded while cyclists pedaled at submaximal intensities of 60%, 80%, and 95% of the maximal power output and compared data between the preferred and non-preferred legs. ANOVA showed symmetry or rather no difference in the amount of peak torque between legs, regardless of pedaling intensity. FANOVA, on the other hand, revealed significant asymmetries between legs, regardless of cycling intensity, apparently for different sections of the cycle, however, not for peak torque, either. We conclude that pedaling asymmetry cannot be quantified solely by peak torques and considering the analysis of the entire movement cycle can more accurately reflect the biomechanical movement pattern. Therefore, FANOVA data analysis could be an alternative to identify asymmetries. A novel approach as described here might be useful when combining kinetics assessment with other approaches like EMG and kinematics and help to better understand the role of pedaling asymmetries for performance and injury risks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is aimed in this study to investigate the effect of geometrical parameters on the degradation behavior of poly (lactic acid) stents in term of strut fracture and fragment separation. In this regard, various structural geometry of the PLA stents was simulated in a stenosed artery using finite element method. For predicting the PLA degradation, a computational model was prepared by which the influence of stents design on their radial strength and fracture was investigated. Using a laboratory-scale designed bioreactor, the PLA fibers degradation was evaluated to calibrate the material parameters and verify the simulation method. Simulation results demonstrated that the geometrical parameters, i.e., number of struts, curves radius and stent cells shape, strongly affect the degradation behavior. The results indicated that the smooth design leads to uniform degradation in the whole stent and decreases the danger of stent fragments separation. It was shown that the maximum degradation rate of the stents with rounded curves was one-third of the models with sharp corners.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

After a motor vehicle collision (MVC), the cause of reported acute onset low back pain is difficult to associate with potential soft tissue strain injury sites including the facet joint and innervated facet joint capsule ligament (FJC). Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to quantify intervertebral anterior-posterior (AP) translation and facet joint capsule strain under varying postures and impact severities. Seventy-two porcine spinal units were exposed to three levels of impact severity (4 g, 8 g, 11 g), and posture (Neutral, Flexion, Extension). Impacts were applied using a custom-built impact track that replicated parameters experienced in low to moderate speed rear-end MVCs. Flexion-extension and anterior-posterior shear neutral zone testing were completed prior to impact. AP intervertebral translation and the strain tensor of the facet capsule ligament were measured during impacts. A significant main effect of collision severity was observed for peak AP intervertebral translation (4 g-2.8 ±0.53 mm; 8 g-6.4 ±2.9 mm; 11 g-8.3 ±0.45 mm) and peak FJC shear strain (2.37% strain change from 4 g to 11 g impact severity). Despite observed main effects of impact severity, no influence of posture was observed. This lack of influence of posture and small FJC strain magnitudes suggest that the FJC does not appear to undergo injurious or permanent mechanical changes in response to low-to-moderate MVC impact scenarios.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Trunk cross-sectional images adopted from the Visible Human male project database were segmented into fat, bone, and lean tissue. Assuming that all male subjects have similar cross-sectional composition at a given body height percentile, areas of the segmented cross-sectional images of the Visible Human male along the trunk were scaled to match those of the predicted body shape. The trunk mass distribution of the target subject can then be computed using the density values of fat, bone, and lean tissue. Comparison of the predicted body shape circumference with ground truth values measured using digital and actual measurements yielded maximum mean error of 13.3 mm and 30.3 mm, respectively. The accuracy of the image segmentation was evaluated, and the results showed a high Jaccard index (>0.95). The proposed method was able to predict the trunk mass distribution of two volunteers with a maximum deviation of 384 g at T4 level and a minimum deviation of 12 g at L4 level and the corresponding centers of mass fell within the experimental data at most levels. Thus, our method can be considered as a feasible option to calculate subject-specific trunk mass distribution.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, situations that require increased cognitive attention may impair an individual's ability to actively control their balance. While dual-task studies have analyzed walking-while-talking conditions, few studies have focused specifically on the influence of cognitive load on balance control. The purpose of this study was to assess how individuals prioritize their cognitive resources and control dynamic balance during dual-task conditions of varying difficulty. Young healthy adults (n = 15) performed two single-task conditions (spelling-while-standing and treadmill walking with no cognitive load) and three dual-task conditions (treadmill walking with increasing cognitive load: attentive listening and spelling short and long words backwards). Cognitive performance did not change between the single- and dual-task as measured by spelling percent error and response rate (p = 0.300). Balance control, assessed using the range of whole-body angular momentum, did not change between the no load and listening conditions, but decreased during the short and long spelling conditions (p < 0.001). These results highlight that in young adults balance control decreases during dual-task treadmill walking with increased cognitive loads, but their cognitive performance does not change. The decrease in balance control suggests that participants prioritized cognitive performance over balance control during these dual-task walking conditions. This work offers additional insight into the automaticity of walking and task-prioritization in healthy young individuals and provides the basis for future studies to determine differences in neurologically impaired populations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Improper function of trunk muscles affects running mechanics adversely and could result in altered lower limb energetics. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of trunk muscles fatigue on plantar pressure distribution in novice runners. 46 novice heel-to-toe runners (26 female and 20 male) ran in 3.3 m/s before and after the trunk muscles fatigue along the plantar pressure measuring device. Then, participants performed trunk muscles fatigue protocol. Trunk muscles fatigue protocol consisted of four consecutive cycles of seven exercises (1) rotating trunk with a medicine ball in sitting position, 2) prone static torso extension with a medicine ball, 3) rotate lower torso with a medicine ball in supine position, 4) incline sit-ups with a weight plate, 5) lateral side binding with a weight plate, 6) rotating lumbar extension with weighted plate, and 7) standing trunk rotation with weighted pulley resistant. After trunk muscles fatigue, increases in loading of lesser toes (p = 0.001, ES = 0.379), fourth (p = 0.001, ES = 0.474) and fifth metatarsals (p = 0.004, ES = 0.173) and medial and lateral heel (p = 0.018,0.001, ES = 0.118,0.427) were observed. Also, foot progression angle (p = 0.001, ES = 392) and relative time of initial contact phase (p = 0.003, ES = 0.182) decreased. The trunk muscles fatigue could alter the plantar pressure distribution pattern.

Therefore, it can have its signal attenuated due to the adipose tissue, directly influencing the results. This study evaluates the influence of different mass added to a sensor's assembly and the adipose tissue on MMG signals of elbow flexor muscles. Test protocol consisted of skinfold thickness measurement of 22 volunteers, followed by applying 2-3 s electrical stimulation for muscle contraction during the acquisition of MMG signals. MMG signals were processed in the time domain, using the average of the absolute amplitude, and expressed in gravity values (G), termed here as MMG(G). Tests occurred four times with different sensor masses. MMG data were processed and analyzed statistically using Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests to determine the differences between the MMG signals measured with different sensor masses. The Mann-Whitney analysis indicated differences in the MMG signals between groups with different skinfold thickness. MMG(G) signals suffered attenuation with increasing sensor mass (0.4416 G to 0.94 g; 0.3902 G to 2.64 g; 0.3762 G to 5.44 g; 0.3762 G to 7.14 g) and adipose tissue.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Our aim was to evaluate whether two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) may be used for the assessment of AV stiffness. We applied STE to AV leaflets in patients with various degrees of degenerative changes of AV and measured strain as an absolute value of the radial deformation of AV leaflets. Deformation of AV expressed as averaged AV strain was greatest in patients with a normal AV (23.4 ± 6.4%), compared to those with aortic sclerosis (12.9 ± 3.2%), moderate-to-severe AS (11.9 ± 4%), and severe AS (10.9 ± 3.5%) (p < 0.01). A non-linear relationship and moderate correlation of AV strain with transvalvular hemodynamic parameters was observed. In patients with mild-to-moderate AS, the strain of AV leaflets also correlated negatively with AV calcification (r = -0.59, p = 0.008). Good inter-observer agreement was obtained for averaged AV strain with a coefficient of variation of 0.15 and an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.94 (p < 0.0001). In this study we demonstrated that deformation of AV leaflets as assessed by STE might be a potential method for a non-invasive evaluation of AV biomechanical properties and of the progression of calcific aortic disease.

Due to the lack of neuromuscular ankle control on the prosthetic side in people with a transtibial amputation (TTA), turning is likely more challenging. The purpose of this study was to quantify how people with TTA maintain dynamic balance during 90-degree turns made with the prosthesis on the inside and outside of the turn compared to people without amputation. Eight participants with TTA and eight age-, height-, and sex- matched non-amputee controls performed left and right 90-degree step turns at a self-selected speed. The primary outcomes were range of whole-body angular momentum and positive and negative contributions of six segment groups (head/trunk, pelvis, arms, and legs) to whole-body angular momentum during the continuation stride. Participants with TTA had greater range of frontal- and sagittal-plane whole-body angular momentum when turning with the prosthesis on the inside compared controls. They also had a greater range of whole-body angular momentum in all planes of motion when turning with the prosthesis on the inside compared to outside of the turn. The contributions for the head/trunk and inside and outside legs differed between groups and turns, suggesting altered interactions between segment momenta to compensate for the reduced contribution of the amputated leg. This study provides insight into possible training paradigms to reduce the high incidence of turn related falls in people with TTA and, potentially, ways to alter prosthetic function to promote balance control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Where biomechanical experiments involve analysis of 1-Dimensional (waveform) data, sample size estimation should consider both 1D variance and hypothesised 1D effects. This study exemplifies 1D sample size estimation using typical biomechanical signals and contrasts this with 0D (discrete) power analysis. For context, biomechanics papers from 2018 and 2019 were reviewed to characterise current practice. Sample size estimation occurred in approximately 4% of 653 papers and reporting practice was mixed. To estimate sample sizes, common biomechanical signals were sourced from the literature and 1D effects were generated artificially using the open-source power1d software. Smooth Gaussian noise was added to the modelled 1D effect to numerically estimate the sample size required. Sample sizes estimated using 1D power procedures varied according to the characteristics of the dataset, requiring only small-to-moderate sample sizes of approximately 5-40 to achieve target powers of 0.8 for reported 1D effects, but were always larger than 0D sample sizes (from N + 1 to >N + 20).

We suspect that a distal-to-proximal redistribution of leg muscle demand, from muscles spanning the ankle to those spanning the hip, contributes to greater metabolic energy costs. Recently, we found that when younger adults using biofeedback target smaller than normal peak propulsive forces (FP), they do so via a similar redistribution of leg muscle demand during walking. This alludes to an experimental paradigm that emulates characteristics of elderly gait independent of other age-related changes relevant to metabolic energy cost. Thus, our purpose was to quantify the metabolic and limb- and joint-level mechanical energy costs associated with modulating propulsive forces during walking in younger adults. Walking with larger FP increased net metabolic power by 47% (main effect, p = 0.001), which was accompanied by small by relatively uniform increases in hip, knee, and ankle joint power and which correlated with total joint power (R2 = 0.151, p = 0.019). Walking with smaller FP increased net metabolic power by 58% (main effect, p < 0.001), which was accompanied by higher step frequencies and increased total joint power due to disproportionate increases in hip joint power. Increases in hip joint power when targeting smaller than normal FP accounted for more than 65% of the variance in the measured changes in net metabolic power. Our findings suggest that walking with a diminished push-off exacts a metabolic penalty because of higher step frequencies and more total limb work due to an increased demand on proximal leg muscles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although some methods have been proposed to characterize the elastic properties of cells, it is still difficult to measure their time-dependent properties. This paper investigates the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) to determine the reduced relaxation modulus of cells. In principle, AFM is hard to perform an indentation relaxation test that requires a constant indenter displacement during load relaxation, whereas the real AFM indenter displacement usually varies with time during relaxation due to the relatively small bending stiffness of its cantilever. We investigate this issue through a combined theoretical, computational, and experimental effort. A protocol relying on the choice of appropriate cantilever bending stiffness is proposed to perform an AFM-based indentation relaxation test of cells, which enables the measurement of reduced relaxation modulus with high accuracy. This protocol is first validated by performing nanoindentation relaxation tests on a soft material and by comparing the results with those from independent measurements. Then indentation tests of cartilage cells are conducted to demonstrate this method in determining time-dependent properties of living cells. Finally, the change in the viscoelasticity of MCF-7 cells under hyperthermia is investigated.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, the aerodynamics of a realistic model of a female runner is calculated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations at four running speeds of 15 km h-1, 18 km h-1, 21 km h-1, and 36 km h-1. Aerodynamic power fractions of the total energy expenditure are found to be in the range of 2.6%-8.5%. Additionally, four exemplary formations are analysed with respect to their drafting potential and resulting drag values are compared for the main runner and her pacers. The best of the formations achieves a total drag reduction on the main runner of 75.6%. Moreover, there are large variations in the drag reduction between the considered formations of up to 42% with respect to the baseline single-runner case. We conclude that major drag reduction of more than 70% can already be achieved with fairly simple formations, while certain factors, such as runners on the sides, can have a detrimental effect on drag reduction due to local acceleration of the passing flow. Using an empirical model for mechanical power output during running, gains of metabolic power and performance predictions are evaluated for all considered formations. Improvements in running economy are up to 3.5% for the best formation, leading to velocity gains of 2.3%. This translates to 154 s (≈2.6 min) saved over a marathon distance. Consequently, direct conclusions are drawn from the obtained data for ideal drafting of long-distance running in highly packed formations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty-five healthy males with 23.4 ± 2 years old were included in this study after examining normality. They performed level walking, stair ascending, and descending in same type of shoes. Measurements of in-shoe plantar pressure including peak pressure, pressure-time integral were done by Pedar-X system, masked 7 regions. Also, pressures in each region throughout the gait cycle were analyzed from each type of walking. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measure one way analysis of variance. Peak pressure in all regions except for the midfoot was higher during level walking than stair walking. Pressure-time integral in the forefoot, midfoot during stair ascending, and the forefoot during stair descending was higher than level walking. In gait cycle, first peak was produced in the heel and the second peak was produced in the hallux during level walking, whereas during stair ascent, the heel and midfoot were in first peak, and the second peak was in the hallux.

These statistical techniques are increasingly applied in the study of locomotion. However, although widely agreed as a key step to obtain reliable and replicable findings, no a priori sample size estimation is usually conducted. This can also be done in 1D tests by calculating the statistical power - i.e., the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false - by using statistical parametric mapping. With the present study we characterised the parameters needed to estimate sample size in locomotion, and how they impact on statistical power in 1D tests. First, noise and signal in kinematics and electromyography were defined using experimental data on locomotion in physiological and pathological participants. Then, 1D power analysis was performed in representative conditions, and a dataset of tabulated sample sizes was generated. Kinematic and electromyographic data showed a smooth Gaussian noise, with amplitude and full-width-at-half-maximum depending on the physiological or pathological condition, and the considered joint or muscle. Given a certain noise, statistical power increased i) with greater signal amplitude and signal full-width-at-half-maximum, ii) when setting a region of interest and iii) when using a paired (vs. unpaired) study design.

Load intensities were derived from in vivo human partitional muscular activation levels collected previously and scaled to the animal model. Mechanical response variables examined included tangent stiffness and hysteresis, in addition to localized surface stretch ratios calculated via virtual tracking points. A significant three-way interaction (p = 0.0009) between elevation angle, load magnitude and cycle number occurred for tangent stiffness, with increasing angles, loads and cycles increasing stiffness by up to 49%. Longitudinal stretch ratios had significant interactions (p = 0.0396) with increasing elevation angles, load intensities and cycle numbers, and differences existed between the articular and bursal sides of the tendon.

However, their corrosion behavior in the human body is still a major issue in research today. In this paper, a strategy to simulate damage evolution in biodegradable magnesium alloy stent is given by introducing a configurational damage model. In the framework of continuum thermodynamics, one can characterize the development and evolution of local damage of materials by establishing internal variables in phenomenological method. We believe that corrosion can damage alloy in two different ways: surface corrosion and stress corrosion. Surface corrosion is described using uniform damage, when the structure is exposed in a corrosion environment; Configurational force is used to describe stress corrosion when the structure is exposed in a stimulating environment. We then select global damage and radial resistance force to perform the changes of macroscopic mechanical properties during stent degradation. Finally, the well performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through several numerical examples. This model has the potential to assist stent design and development in the future.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Finite element (FE) models of the proximal femur may help in the assessment of patients at high risk for a hip fracture. However, extensive validation is essential before these models can be used in a clinical setting. This study aims to use strain measurements from bilateral digital image correlation to validate an FE model against ex vivo experimental data of proximal femora under a sideways fall loading condition. For twelve subjects, full-field strain measurements were available on the medial and lateral side of the femoral neck. In this study, subject-specific FE models were generated based on a consolidated procedure previously validated for stance loading. The material description included strain rate dependency and separate yield and fracture strain limits in tension and compression. FE predicted fracture force and experimentally measured peak forces showed a strong correlation (R2 = 0.92). The FE simulations predicted the fracture initiation within 3 mm distance of the experimental fracture line for 8/12 subjects. The predicted and measured strains correlated well on both the medial side (R2 = 0.87) and the lateral side (R2 = 0.74). The lower correlation on the lateral side is attributed to the irregularity of the cortex and presence of vessel holes in this region.

We also examined the association of the degree of pes planovalgus with muscle mass of the ankle joint and foot muscles in children with DS and children with TD. The subjects were 24 children with TD (control [CTR] group) and 23 children with DS (DS group). To assess pes planovalgus, the Arch Height Index (AHI) in the standing position was measured. Muscle thickness of the ankle joint and foot muscles was measured using an ultrasound imaging device. The AHI and thickness of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles were significantly lower in the DS group than those in the CTR group. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was significantly greater in the DS group than that in the CTR group. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle was a significant and independent factor of the AHI in children comprising the CTR and DS groups. The thickness of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increased with decreasing AHI. The results of this study suggest that the AHI and muscle mass of the soleus and tibialis posterior muscles decrease, while muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle increases in children with DS. The results also indicate that decreased AHI is associated with increased muscle mass of the flexor digitorum longus muscle in children.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet, the accuracy is often hindered by Soft Tissue Artifact (STA). This is a major issue in clinical gait analysis where kinematic results are used for decision-making. It also has a considerable influence on the results of rigid body and Finite Element (FE) musculoskeletal models that rely on SM-based kinematics to estimate muscle, contact and ligament forces. Current techniques devised to compensate for STA, in particular multi-body optimization methods, often consider simplified joint models. Although joint personalization with anatomical constraints has improved kinematic estimation, these models yet don't represent a fully reliable solution to the STA problem, thus allowing us to envisage an alternative approach. In this perspective, we propose to develop a conceptual FE-based model of the lower limb for STA compensation and evaluate it for 66 healthy subjects under level walking motor task. Both hip and knee joint kinematics were analyzed, considering both rotational and translational joint motion. Results showed that STA caused underestimation of the hip joint kinematics (up to 2.2°) for all rotational DoF, and overestimation of knee joint kinematics (up to 12°) except in flexion/extension. Joint kinematics, in particular the knee joint, appeared to be sensitive to soft tissue stiffness parameters (rotational and translational mean difference up to 1.5° and 3.4 mm). Analysis of the results using alternative joint representations highlighted the versatility of the proposed modeling approach. This work paves the way for using personalized models to compensate for STA in healthy subjects and different activities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Since data are frequently limited, the optimal method for surfactant delivery has yet to be established towards more standardized guidelines. Here, we explore the dynamics of liquid plug transport using an anatomically-relevant, true-scale in vitro 3D model of the upper airways of a premature infant. We quantify the initial plug's distribution as a function of two underlying parameters that can be clinically controlled; namely, the injection flow rate and the viscosity of the administered fluid. By extracting a homogeneity index (HI), our in vitro results underline how the combination of both high fluid viscosity and injection flow rates may be advantageous in improving homogeneous dispersion. Such outcomes are anticipated to help refine future SRT administration guidelines towards more uniform distribution using more anatomically-realistic 3D in vitro models at true scale of the preterm neonate.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The evaluation of the proportion of the inter-segmental moments that can be attributed to passive moments has led to divergent results. Thus, the purpose of this study was to systematically search and synthesize the evidence of the contribution of passive moments to inter-segmental moments during healthy and pathological gait. A broad systematic search was performed including four databases. Thirteen studies met all inclusion criteria. Results showed that passive moments participate to inter-segmental moments during gait in a non-negligible way. For the ankle, the evaluation of the proportion of inter-segmental moment attributed to passive structures is 5-20% around the push-off. For the knee, this proportion is 40-98% during late swing and 10-80% during the single support phase. For the hip, it is 20-50% at push-off. For pathological population, it has been shown that this contribution may sometimes be more important, either due to a smaller inter-segmental moment or a larger passive moment. These results suggest that passive mechanisms can contribute substantially to normal human gait, facilitating the propulsion or the braking of the joint. Passive structures, acting as elastic springs, thus help to reduce the energy cost of gait. For pathological gait, studying the contribution of passive moments to inter-segmental moments can help to better understand the aetiology of the pathology.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This decline in capacity may result in the inability to stand up (sit-to-stand, sit-to-walk), which is an important movement for independent living. Compensation, as a result of functional redundancy, is key in understanding how much age-related decline can be tolerated before movement limitations arise. Yet, this topic has been underexposed in the biomechanics literature. The purpose of this systematic review was to approach the literature on sit-to-stand and sit-to-walk studies from the perspective of compensation and create an overview of our current understanding of compensation in standing up, identifying the limitations and providing future recommendations. A literature search was performed, using the keywords and their synonyms: strateg*(approach, technique, way)AND, sit-to-walk OR sit-to-stand OR rise (raise, arise, stand, stand-up) AND chair (seat). Inclusion criteria: full articles on biomechanics or motor control on sit-to-stand or sit-to-walk in healthy adults (<60y), healthy or frail elderly adults (>60y), and adults with osteoarthritis. The results show that the experimental set-ups and musculoskeletal models in STS and STW studies generally exclude compensation by using restricted protocols and simplifications. Moreover, factors are mostly analysed in isolation, excluding confounding causes within capacity and/or movement objectives which limits the generalization of the results. Future studies in the standing up task should consider to (1) determine the effect of varying arm push-off strategies, (2) focus on sit-to-walk, (3) determine the biomechanical implications of asymmetry, and (4)incorporate assessments of physical capacity as well as changes in psychological priorities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Video-based markerless motion capture is a user-friendly, inexpensive, and widely applicable technology that could reduce the barriers to measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters in clinical and more diverse settings. Two studies were performed to determine whether gait parameters measured using markerless motion capture demonstrate concurrent validity with those measured using marker-based motion capture and a pressure-sensitive gait mat. For the first study, thirty healthy young adults performed treadmill gait at self-selected speeds while marker-based motion capture and synchronized video data were recorded simultaneously. For the second study, twenty-five healthy young adults performed over-ground gait at self-selected speeds while footfalls were recorded using a gait mat and synchronized video data were recorded simultaneously. Kinematic heel-strike and toe-off gait events were used to identify the same gait cycles between systems. Nine spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured by each system and directly compared between systems. Measurements were compared using Bland-Altman methods, mean differences, Pearson correlation coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficients. The results indicate that markerless measurements of spatiotemporal gait parameters have good to excellent agreement with marker-based motion capture and gait mat systems, except for stance time and double limb support time relative to both systems and stride width relative to the gait mat. These findings indicate that markerless motion capture can adequately measure spatiotemporal gait parameters of healthy young adults during treadmill and over-ground gait.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fourteen healthy men participated in this study. The shear moduli of the RF, VL, and VM were measured in four hip positions: flexion (Flex), extension and abduction (Ext-Abd), extension (Ext), and extension and adduction (Ext-Add). As the behavior of shear moduli may differ depending on the parts of the vasti muscles, we measured the medial and lateral parts of the VL (Medial-VL and Lateral-VL) and VM (Medial-VM and Lateral-VM). The shear moduli at the Ext and Ext-Add positions were higher than at the Flex position in the RF, VL, and VM. The shear moduli during Ext and Ext-Add were higher than at the Ext-Abd in the RF, VL, and Lateral-VM. Moreover, the shear modulus of the Lateral-VM was higher than of the Medial-VM (Flex: 8.5% higher; Ext-Abd: 15.6%; Ext: 30.2%; Ext-Add: 32.6%). The shear moduli of the VL and VM, which are monoarticular muscles of the knee, increased with passive hip extension or adduction with extension, even when the knee angle was kept constant. The results suggest that EMFT occurs in the quadriceps, and EMFT had a great impact in the Lateral-VM, which is anatomically adjacent to the RF, but it had little effect in the Medial-VM, which is further away from the RF.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These cell activities alter bone architecture and tissue composition. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine whether multiscale (10-2 to 10-7 m) characterization can provide more integrated information to understand the effects of estrogen deficiency on the fracture risk of bone. This is the first study to examine the effects of estrogen deficiency on multiscale characteristics of the same bone specimen. Sprague-Dawley female rats (6 months old) were obtained for a bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) or a sham operation (sham). Micro-computed tomography of rat femurs provided bone volumetric, mineral density, and morphological parameters. Dynamic mechanical analysis, static elastic and fracture mechanical testing, and nanoindentation were also performed using the same femur. As expected, the current findings indicate that OVX reduces bone quantity (mass and bone mineral density) and quality (morphology, and fracture displacement). Additionally, they demonstrated reductions in amount and heterogeneity of tissue mineral density (TMD) and viscoelastic properties.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the fatigue life of whole rabbit-tibiae under cyclic uniaxial compression and biaxial (compression and torsion) loading, and to explore the relationship between fatigue life and specimen-specific finite element (FE) predictions of stress/strain. Twelve tibiae were tested cyclically until failure across a range of uniaxial-compressive loads. Another twenty-two tibiae were separated into three groups and loaded biaxially; peak compressive load was constant in all three groups (50% ultimate force) but torsion was varied (0%, 25%, or 50% of ultimate torque). FE models with heterogeneous linear-elastic material properties were developed from computed tomography. We assessed peak stress/strain and stressed/strained volume based on principal stress/strain, as well as von Mises and pressure modified von Mises criteria. A logarithmic (r2 = 0.68; p < 0.001) relationship was observed between uniaxial-compressive load and fatigue life. Biaxial tests demonstrated that fatigue life decreased with superposed torsion (p = 0.034). Strained volume, based on a maximum principal strain or pressure modified von Mises strain criteria, were strong predictors of fatigue life under both uniaxial (r2 = 0.73-0.82) and biaxial (r2 = 0.59-0.60) loads, and these outperformed equivalent peak stress- and strain-based measures. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating strain distributions, rather than peak stress or strain, to predict the fatigue behavior or whole bone, which has important implications for the study of stress fracture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As the human movement system has physiological and functional redundancy, movement limitations do not promptly arise at the onset of physical decline. A such, prediction of movement limitations is complex: it is unclear how much decline can be tolerated before movement limitations start. Currently, the term 'homeostatic reserve' or 'physiological reserve' is used to refer to the redundancy of the human biological system, but these terms do not describe the redundancy in the muscle architecture of the human body. The result of functional redundancy is compensation. Although compensation is an early predictor of movement limitations, clear definitions are lacking and the topic is underexposed in literature. The aim of this article is to provide a definition of compensation and emphasize its importance. Compensation is defined as an alteration in the movement trajectory and/or altering muscle recruitment to complete a movement task. Compensation for capacity is the result of a lack in neuromusculoskeletal reserve, where reserve is defined as the difference between the capacity (physiological abilities of the neuromusculoskeletal system) and the task demand. Compensation for movement objectives is a result of a shift in weighting of movement objectives, reflecting changing priorities. Studying compensation in biomechanics requires altered protocols in experimental set-ups, musculoskeletal models that are not reliant on prescribed movement, and inclusion of alternative movement objectives in optimal control theory.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In studies that investigate the interplay between microstructure and tissue-level mechanics, mechanical testing of cleared tissue may be useful. However, the effects of optical clearing on soft tissue mechanics have not been investigated. Thus, we set out to quantify the effects of a simple and effective optical clearing protocol on the mechanics of soft collagenous tissues using ovine mitral valve anterior leaflets as a model system. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an isotonic glycerol-DMSO optical clearing protocol in two-photon microscopy. Second, we evaluate the mechanical effects of optical clearing on leaflets under equibiaxial tension in a dependent study design. Lastly, we quantify the shrinkage strain while traction-free and the contractile forces while constrained during clearing. We found the optical clearing protocol to improve two-photon imaging depth from ~100 μm to ~500-800 μm, enabling full-thickness visualization of second-harmonic generation, autofluorescent, and fluorophore-tagged structures. Under equibiaxial tension, cleared tissues exhibited reduced circumferential (p < 0.001) and radial (p = 0.009) transition stretches (i.e. stretch where collagen is recruited), and reduced radial stiffness (p = 0.031). Finally, during clearing we observed ~10-15% circumferential and radial compressive strains, and when constrained, ~2mN of circumferential and radial traction forces. In summary, we suggest the use of this optical clearing agent with mechanical testing be done with care, as it appears to alter the tissue's stress-free configuration and stiffness, likely due to tissue dehydration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The 'repeated bout effect' (RBE) can attenuate these impairments when performing a subsequent bout. The influence of eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage on low-frequency force production is well-characterized; however, it is unclear how eccentric exercise and the RBE affect torque production across a range of stimulation frequencies (i.e., the torque-frequency relationship). We investigated the influence of an initial (Bout 1) and repeated bout (Bout 2) of eccentric exercise on the elbow flexor torque-frequency relationship. Eleven males completed two bouts of high-intensity eccentric elbow flexions, 4 weeks apart. Torque-frequency relationships were constructed at baseline and 0.5, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 h following both bouts via percutaneous stimulation at 1, 6, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 Hz. Serum creatine kinase activity, self-reported muscle soreness, and isometric maximum voluntary contraction torque indirectly inferred the presence of muscle damage following Bout 1, and attenuation of muscle damage following Bout 2. Torque amplitude at all stimulation frequencies was impaired 30 min following eccentric exercise, however, torque at lower (1-10 Hz) and higher frequencies (40-100 Hz) recovered within 24 h while torque across the middle frequency range (20-30 Hz) recovered by 48 h.

This study investigates power-velocity and force-velocity relationships during resistance exercises performed on stable and unstable surfaces with different weights. A group of 63 physically active young men performed chest presses on the bench and Swiss ball, and squats on the firm surface and BOSU ball with weights from 20 kg to at least 85% of one-repetition maximum. Peak and/or mean values of power, velocity and force were analyzed. Results showed significantly lower peak power and force during chest presses on the Swiss ball as opposed to the bench at lower velocities (147.6 W and 176.0 N at 1.1 m·s-1, 108.7 W and 126.4 N at 1.3 m·s-1, 112.0 W and 72.7 N at 1.5 m·s-1; all at p < 0.01).

The stiffness change is accomplished by moving the supports points on the glass fiber leaf spring of the VSA ankle unit. We described the design and characterized changes in ankle stiffness using a mechanical test bench. A novel method was used to capture mechanical test data using a six degree of freedom load cell, allowing us to contrast mechanical and biomechanical data. A transtibial unilateral amputee performed level ground walking on an instrumented treadmill. The VSA prosthetic foot exhibited ankle stiffness change in the mechanical test bench. Ankle stiffness changes were also confirmed during the biomechanical analysis. Future work will involve additional subjects.

These are normally described through the observation of the trajectory of the center of pressure (CoP). Even though, external factors such as stepping direction and footwear are known to modify APAs, quantitative investigations regarding their relevant effects are understudied in the literature. Therefore, this study aims at characterizing APAs patterns prior to forward and backward stepping when performed either in barefoot or shod condition and explores their variability. Twenty-eight young healthy volunteers participated in the study. CoP trajectories were recorded using a force plate and relevant spatio-temporal parameters extracted (i.e. duration, amplitude, and mean speed). Results showed distinct effects of both direction of the step and footwear on APAs: the first mainly induces variations of APAs along the anteroposterior direction, whereas the latter in the mediolateral direction. In addition, variability indices exhibited lower values for the APAs along the mediolateral axis which was affected by neither footwear nor direction of the step. This study extends previous literature by revealing significant direction X footwear interactions on APAs. Furthermore, regardless of these factors, the medio-lateral strategy is still well preserved, highlighting the prioritization of balance control over motor performance. In conclusion, both direction and footwear have a major effect on postural preparation therefore both factors should be included when evaluating APAs in real-life condition.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, it is not known if and how H is influenced by speed when stepping. This study aimed to investigate the effect on H of increasing speed during step initiation in older adults. Twenty-seven healthy individuals over 60 were enrolled in the current study and were instructed to perform a series of step initiations with their dominant leg under two speed conditions: at preferred speed and as fast as possible. Two force plates and a motion-capture system were used to record H and the components of the net external moment (moment arms and ground reaction forces) during the double support and step execution phases of stepping. Results revealed that increasing speed of stepping affected H differently in both stepping phases and in the different planes. H ranges in all three planes increased with speed during the double support phase. During the step execution phase, while H ranges in frontal and transversal planes decreased, sagittal plane H range significantly increased with speed. This increased H range in the sagittal plane, which may result from the task demands, could impose a greater challenge for balance control in the elderly.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the extent to which TBI alters microvessel structure is not well understood. Specifically, how intracranial mechanical responses produced during impacts relate to vascular damage needs to be better studied. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the biomechanical mechanisms and thresholds of brain microvascular injury. Detailed microvascular damage of mouse brain was quantified using Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ex vivo Serial Two-Photon Tomography (STPT) in seven mice that had undergone controlled cortical impact. Mechanical strains were investigated through finite element (FE) modeling of the mouse brain. We then compared the post-injury vessel density map with FE-predicted strain and found a moderate correlation between the vessel length density and the predicted peak maximum principal strains (MPS) (R2 = 0.52). High MPS was observed at the impact regions with low vessel length density, supporting the mechanism of strain-triggered microvascular damage. Using logistic regression, the MPS corresponding to a 50% probability of injury was found to be 0.17. Given the literature reporting MPS of over 0.2 in the human brain for mild TBI/concussion cases, it is highly recommended to consider microvascular damage when investigating mild TBI/concussion in the future.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Highly accurate 3D-reconstructions of both devices were obtained through an integrated optical coherence tomography and micro-CT imaging approach. Both cannula configurations displayed complex flow structures inside the atrium, superimposed over predominant recirculation regimes. We found that the Avalon DLC performed significantly better than the Origen alternative, by capturing 80% and 94% of venous blood from the inferior and superior vena cavae, respectively and infusing the oxygenated blood with an efficiency of more than 85%. The micro-scale geometric design features of the Avalon DLC that are associated with superior hemodynamics were investigated through 14 parametric cannula configurations. These simulations showed that the strategic placement of drainage holes, the smooth infusion blood stream diverter and efficient distribution of the venous blood capturing area between the vena cavae are associated with robust blood flow performance. Nevertheless, our parametric results indicate that there is still room for further device optimization beyond the performance measurements for both Avalon and Origen DLC in this study. In particular, the performance envelope of malpositioned cannula and off-design conditions require additional blood flow simulations for analysis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Understanding the contact pattern of hip and knee replacement has improved their design and function; however, the in vivo contact pattern of TWA has not yet been examined and is thus the aim of this study. We hypothesized that the center of contact (CoC) is located at the geometric centers of the carpal component and radial component in the neutral posture and that the CoC moves along the principal arcs of curvature throughout primary anatomical motions. Wrist motion and implant kinematics of six patients with the Freedom® total wrist implant were studied during various tasks using biplanar videoradiography. The location of the CoC of the components was investigated by calculating distance fields between the articular surfaces. We found the CoC at the neutral posture was not at the geometric centers but was located 3.5 mm radially on the carpal component and 1.2 mm ulnarly on the radial component. From extension to flexion, the CoC moved 10.8 mm from dorsal to volar side on the carpal component (p < 0.0001) and 7.2 mm from volar to dorsal on the radial component (p = 0.0009). From radial to ulnar deviation, the CoC moved 12.4 mm from radial to ulnar on the carpal component (p < 0.0001), and 5.6 mm from ulnar to radial on the radial component (p = 0.009). The findings of this study may eventually improve TWA success by advancing future designs through a more accurate understating of their kinematic performance in vivo.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the retrospective study, a study group of TIS-FDPs (n = 23) presenting prosthetic screw loosening and a control group of TIS-FDPs (n = 32) absent of prosthetic screw loosening during observation period were included. The prosthesis height (PH), inter-implant distance (ID) and cantilever distance (CD) of TIS-FDPs were measured and compared within two groups. In the finite element analysis (FEA) part, three serials of models presenting different clinical scenarios were constructed based on the abovementioned PH, ID and CD values respectively. In the clinical evaluation, the values of pH and CD in study group were statistically higher than those in control group, whereas the values of ID had no significant difference. In the FEA, the results indicated that there was no linear correlation between the increased ID values and the maximum von Mises stresses and the rotation angles. On the other hand, the increased PH and CD values would result in a strong linear growth of the maximum von Mises stresses and the rotation angles. Besides, it was found that the regression coefficients in PH model were all higher than those in ID and CD models. When TIS-FDPs were delivered in posterior region, the PH and the CD, rather than the ID, seemed to have a significant impact on the stress concentration of the prosthetic screws and the incident of prosthetic screws loosening.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, identifying the position for effectively lengthening each PMa region is critical in preventing PMa injuries. The purpose of this study was to determine the effective stretching position for each PMa region through shear wave elastography, which can indirectly assess individual muscle lengthening. Fifteen men participated in this study. Twelve stretching positions were compounded with shoulder abductions (45°, 90°, and 135°), pelvic rotation (with or without), shoulder external rotation (with or without), and shoulder horizontal abductions. The shear modulus of each PMa region was measured through shear wave elastography in the stretching positions mentioned above. At the clavicular region, the shear modulus was higher for three stretching positions: shoulder horizontal abduction at 45° abduction during pelvic rotation and shoulder external rotation, shoulder horizontal abduction at 90° abduction, and shoulder horizontal abduction at 90° abduction while considering shoulder external rotation. For the sternal region, the shear modulus was higher in two stretching positions: shoulder horizontal abduction at 90° abduction while adding external rotation, and combination of pelvic rotation and external rotation. For the abdominal region, the shear modulus was higher in the shoulder horizontal abduction at 135° abduction with pelvic and external rotation. These results indicated that the effective stretching position was different for each PMa region.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Dentists therefore rely on experience and simplified mechanical in-vitro experiments comprising deflection of orthodontic wires. Predicting the mechanical behaviour of orthodontic wires during clinical therapy requires understanding of the different contact states at multi-bracket-wire interfaces. This study experimentally investigates the effect of different bracket-wire contact configurations in a three-bracket setup and uses two numerical approaches to analyse and complement the experimental data. Commonly used round stainless-steel wires (diameter: 0.012″ and 0.016″) and titanium-molybdenum alloy wires (diameter: 0.016″ and 0.018″) were tested. All six force-moment components were measured separately for each of the three brackets. The results indicate that a specific sequence of distinct bracket-wire contact configurations occurs. Several transitions between configurations caused substantial changes of effective wire stiffness (EWS), which were consistent among experimental and numerical methods. The lowest EWS was observed for the configuration in which the wire touched only one wing of the lateral brackets. Taking this stiffness as 100%, the transition to a configuration in which the wire touched two opposing wings of the lateral brackets resulted in an increase of EWS of 300% ± 10%. This increase was independent of the wire type. Additional contacts resulted in further increases of stiffness beyond 400%. The results of this combined experimental and numerical study are important for providing a fundamental understanding of multi-bracket-wire contact configurations and have important implications for clinical therapy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Variability and local dynamic stability are frequently used to characterize movement patterns. In view of a lack of information on reliability of these measures, we determined their within- and between-session reliability in repeated seated reaching. Thirty-six participants (21 healthy, 15 LBP) executed three trials of repeated seated reaching on two days. An optical motion capture system recorded positions of cluster markers, located on the spinous processes of S1 and T8. Movement patterns were characterized by the spatial variability (meanSD) of the lumbar Euler angles: flexion-extension, lateral bending, axial rotation, temporal variability (CyclSD) and local dynamic stability (LDE). Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficients of variation (CV) and Bland-Altman plots. Sufficient reliability was defined as an ICC ≥ 0.5 and a CV < 20%. To determine the effect of number of repetitions on reliability, analyses were performed for the first 10, 20, 30, and 40 repetitions of each time series. MeanSD, CyclSD, and the LDE had moderate within-session reliability; meanSD: ICC = 0.60-0.73 (CV = 14-17%); CyclSD: ICC = 0.68 (CV = 17%); LDE: ICC = 0.62 (CV = 5%). Between-session reliability was somewhat lower; meanSD: ICC = 0.44-0.73 (CV = 17-19%); CyclSD: ICC = 0.45-0.56 (CV = 19-22%); LDE: ICC = 0.25-0.54 (CV = 5-6%). MeanSD, CyclSD and the LDE are sufficiently reliable to assess lumbar movement patterns in single-session experiments, and at best sufficiently reliable in multi-session experiments.

Previous studies utilizing surgical navigation technology and cadaveric models attempted to identify operative techniques to correct knees with flexion contracture and minimize undesirable outcomes such as knee instability. However, no consensus has emerged on a surgical strategy to treat this clinical condition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a computational model of TKA with flexion contracture that can be used to devise surgical strategies that restore knee extension and to understand factors that cause negative outcomes. We developed six computational models of knees implanted with a posteriorly stabilized TKA using a measured resection technique. We incorporated tensions in the collateral ligaments representative of those achieved in TKA using reference data from a cadaveric experiment and determined tensions in the posterior capsule elements in knees with flexion contracture by simulating a passive extension exam. Subject-specific extension moments were calculated and used to evaluate the amount of knee extension that would be restored after incrementally resecting the distal femur. Model predictions of the extension angle after resecting the distal femur by 2 and 4 mm were within 1.2° (p ≥ 0.32) and 1.6° (p ≥ 0.25), respectively, of previous studies. Accordingly, the presented computational method could be a credible surrogate to study the mechanical impact of flexion contracture in TKA and to evaluate its surgical treatment.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The study included 67 breast cancer survivors with and without unilateral lymphedema. Individuals were divided into non-lymphedema, moderate and severe lymphedema groups according to the volumetric measurement difference between the affected and unaffected upper extremities. A three-dimensional motion monitor-electromagnetic system was used to analyze scapular movements during the elevation and depression phases of the upper extremity elevation in the scapular plane. Shoulder range of motion was assessed with a digital inclinometer. Upper extremity function was assessed with the 'Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire-Short Form (Quick-DASH)'. The scapular upward rotation was lower for the severe lymphedema group than for the non-lymphedema group in the 90-60-30° depression phases of arm elevation (p < .05). The scapular anterior tilt was higher for the severe lymphedema group than for the non-lymphedema group in the 30° depression phase of arm elevation (p < .05). Shoulder abduction range of motion was the lowest in the severe lymphedema group (p < .05). The non-lymphedema group had the lowest quick-DASH score and the severe lymphedema group had the highest score (p < .05). There were statistically significant moderate associations between the quick-DASH scores and scapular movements in all groups (p < .05).

The consequential head rotations have to be stabilised in space for a steady gaze and an accurate sense of self-motion for balance. The ecology and anatomy of the species determine the necessity to stabilise the head in yaw, pitch, and roll direction. Terrestrial lizards, running with a sprawled body posture, are especially prone to undulations in the horizontal (yaw) plane. Measurements on an experimental oscillation platform show that Acanthodactylus pardalis lizards stabilise their head less in pitch direction (54% stabilisation) than in yaw and roll direction (66% and 64% stabilisation, respectively). Because we performed these experiments in darkness, the lizards based their head stabilisation on vestibular information. Hence, we hypothesised that their vestibular system is less sensitive in pitch direction than in yaw and roll direction. Yet, this was not confirmed by a detailed Fluid-Structure Interaction model of the membranous labyrinth, which showed that not pitch sensitivity (88% of yaw sensitivity), but roll sensitivity (73% of yaw sensitivity) is the lowest. So why is the head stabilisation in darkness almost as good in roll direction as in yaw direction? While this may be due to neurological nonlinearities, it seems worth noticing that the moment of inertia is lowest in roll direction due to the elongated head shape. Hence, less torque is needed to stabilise a head rotation in roll direction than in the other two directions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As cells pass through narrow gaps, smaller than the nuclear diameter, the spatial configuration of chromatin must change along with the distribution of nuclear enzymes. Nuclear stiffness is an important determinant of the ability of cells to undergo transendothelial migration, yet no studies have been conducted to assess whether tumor cell cytoskeletal or nuclear stiffness changes during this critical process in order to facilitate passage. To address this question, we employed two non-contact methods, Brillouin confocal microscopy (BCM) and confocal reflectance quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), to track the changes in mechanical properties of live, transmigrating tumor cells in an in vitro collagen gel platform. Using these two imaging modalities to study transmigrating MDA-MB-231, A549, and A375 cells, we found that both the cells and their nuclei soften upon extravasation and that the nuclear membranes remain soft for at least 24 h. These new data suggest that tumor cells adjust their mechanical properties in order to facilitate extravasation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Levodopa improves muscle activation, strength, and coordination; thus, facilitating increased step length, but few studies have evaluated the underlying forces associated with medication-induced gait improvements. Here, we assess the effects of levodopa on gait kinetics in persons with Parkinson's disease. Over two sessions, 13 participants with Parkinson's disease walked on a treadmill while both optimally medicated and after a 12-hour medication withdrawal. Walking was analyzed for spatiotemporal parameters, ranges of motion, anterior-posterior ground reaction forces, joint torques, and powers using an instrumented treadmill and motion capture system. When on medication, participants increased gait speed by significantly improving step length (p = .009) and time (p = .004). Peak propulsive force (p = .001) and hip flexion torques (p = .003) increased with medication while hip extensor and ankle plantarflexor torques did not. While differences in joint power were not significantly different, the optimal medication condition showed medium to large effects, with the largest effect at the hip (dz = 0.84). Our findings suggest the underlying forces responsible for the increases in gait speed are primarily due to increases at the hip, with limited change at the ankle. Disproportionate use of muscle force may be a limiting factor for levodopa's use as an intervention for walking. Future interventions should consider targeting force production deficits during gait in those with Parkinson's disease.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Markerless motion capture offers an alternative method for the collection of gait kinematics that presents several practical benefits over marker-based systems. This work aimed to determine the reliability of lower limb gait kinematics from video based markerless motion capture using an established experimental protocol for testing reliability. Eight healthy adult participants performed three sessions of five over-ground walking trials in their own self-selected clothing, separated by an average of 8.5 days, while eight synchronized and calibrated cameras recorded video. Three-dimensional pose estimates from the video data were used to compute lower limb joint angles. Inter-session variability, inter-trial variability, and the variability ratio were used to assess the reliability of the gait kinematics. Compared to repeatability studies based on marker-based motion capture, inter-trial variability was slightly greater than previously reported for some angles, with an average across all joint angles of 2.5°. Inter-session variability was smaller on average than all previously reported values, with an average across all joint angles of 2.8°. Variability ratios were all smaller than those previously reported with an average of 1.1, indicating that the multi-session protocol increased the total variability of joint angles by 10% of the inter-trial variability.

While a number of risk factors for ASD have been suggested, its exact pathogenesis remains to be identified. Finite element (FE) models are indispensable tools to investigate mechanical effects of fusion surgeries on post-fusion changes in the adjacent segment kinematics and kinetics. Existing modeling studies validate only their intact FE model against in vitro data and subsequently simulate post-fusion in vivo conditions. The present study provides a novel approach for the comprehensive validation of a lumbar (T12-S1) FE model in post-fusion conditions. Sixteen simulated fusion surgeries, performed on cadaveric specimens using various testing and loading conditions, were modeled by this FE model. Predictions for adjacent segment range of motion (RoM) and intradiscal pressure (IDP) were compared with those obtained from the corresponding in vitro tests. Overall, 70% of the predicted adjacent segment RoMs were within the range of in vitro data for both intact and post-fusion conditions. Correlation (r) values between model and in vitro findings for the adjacent segment RoMs were positive and greater than 0.84. Most of the predicted IDPs were, however, out of the narrow range of in vitro IDPs at the adjacent segments but with great positive correlations (r ≥ 0.89).

The present study evaluates the repeatability and reproducibility of a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based elastography (OCE) method for in vivo quantification of corneal natural frequency in 20 normal human eyes. Sub-micron corneal oscillations were induced by repeated low-force (13 Pa) microliter air pulses at the corneal apex and were observed by common-path phase-sensitive OCT imaging adjacent to a measurement region of 1-6.25 mm2. Corneal natural frequencies were quantified using a single degree of freedom model based on the corneal oscillations. Corneal natural frequencies ranged from 234 to 277 Hz (coefficient of variation: 3.2%; n = 286 for a 2.5 × 2.5 mm2 area; time: 28.6 s). The same natural frequencies can be acquired using a smaller sampling size (n = 9 for 1 mm2) and a shorter time (0.9 s). Spatial distribution and local changes in natural frequencies can be distinguished using denser sampling (e.g., 26 × 41 points for 2.5 × 5 mm2). This novel optical method demonstrates highly repeatable and reliable in vivo measurements of human corneal natural frequencies.

Our previous study confirmed that the cyclic mechanical stimulation (CMS) inhibited the proliferation of RA FLSs, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study aimed to investigate these underlying mechanisms. The in vitro cultured human RA FLSs were subjected to CMS (6%, 1.0 Hz). Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK-2 and p27 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MTS assay was used to detect cell viability. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in RA FLSs were detected by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The results showed that CMS significantly inhibited the cell cycle transformation of RA FLSs from G1 phase to S phase, which significantly decreased the cell proliferation index. Meanwhile, both cyclin E1 and CDK-2 gene expressions were significantly decreased, p27 gene expression was increased, and no significant change was observed in the expression of cyclin D1. The inhibition of COX-2/PGE2 pathway in RA FLSs by celecoxib treatment showed no effect on the inhibition of RA FLSs proliferation by CMS. In conclusion, CMS inhibited the proliferation of RA FLSs by modulating the expression of cell cycle-related molecules such as cyclin E1, CDK2 and p27 to arrest cell cycle transformation, which is independent of COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Females demonstrate lower extremity landing mechanics that often place them at a larger risk of injury compared to their male counterparts. While efforts have been made to understand lower extremity mechanics during stop-jump landings, little is known regarding the musculature function during these tasks and how they may influence ACL loading. Understanding lower extremity muscle contributions to ACL loading (FACL) may give insight to improving injury prevention protocols. Ten healthy, recreationally active females completed five trials of an unanticipated stop-jump task. Right leg kinematics, kinetics, and electromyography data were collected with three-dimensional motion capture, force plates, and electromyography sensors, respectively. Modified musculoskeletal models were scaled based on participant-specific anthropometrics, and muscle forces were obtained using static optimization. An induced acceleration analysis combined with a previously established mathematical ACL loading model was used to calculate lower extremity muscle contribution to FACL. The vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medials, biceps femoris long head, semimembranosus, and soleus were found to be the primary contributors to FACL, with the vastus lateralis being the largest contributor. These data suggest that muscles traditionally known as ACL unloaders may in certain conditions load the ACL. These results also suggest that future injury prevention protocols should target muscles specifically to mitigate the influence the vastus lateralis has on ACL loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Identifying time of initial foot contact can be challenging in runners with different strike patterns. Peak downward velocity of the pelvis (PDVP) has been validated in a laboratory setting to detect initial contact. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) allow measurements of kinematic variables outside laboratory settings. The aim of this study was to validate the PDVP method using an inertial and optical motion capture system to detect initial contact at different speeds and foot strike patterns compared to the force sensing criterion. Twenty healthy runners ran for two minutes at 11, 13, and 15 km/h on a force-instrumented treadmill. 3D kinematics were obtained from an optical motion capture system and an 8-sensor inertial system. A generalized estimating equation showed no effect of footstrike pattern on the time difference (offset) between initial contact based on an inertial or optical system and the force sensing criterion. There was a significant main effect of speed on offset, in which offsets decreased with higher speeds. There was no interaction effect of speed and foot strike pattern on the offsets. Offsets ranged from 21.7 ± 0.2 ms for subjects running at 15 km/h (inertial versus force sensing criterion) to 27.2 ± 0.1 ms for subjects running at 11 km/h (optical versus force sensing criterion).

The device and/or implant inserter failures typically occur during device impaction into the disc space and require implant removal and replacement. These additional steps may cause further complications along with increased surgical time and cost. Currently, there are no standardized test methods that evaluate clinically relevant impaction loading conditions on IBFDs. This study aims to develop an in vitro test method that would evaluate implant resistance to failure during intra-operative impaction. To achieve this, (1) surgical implantations of IBFDs were simulated in nine lumbar cadaver specimens by three different orthopedic spine surgeons (n = 3/surgeon). Impact force and mallet speed data were acquired for each surgeon. (2) Based on the acquired surgeon data, a benchtop mechanical test setup was developed to differentiate between two TLIF IBFD designs and two inserter designs (for a total of four IBFD-inserter combinations) under impaction loading. During implant insertion, impact force measurements indicated that lumbar IBFDs are subjected to high energy forces that may exceed their mechanical strength. Our test method successfully replicated clinically-relevant loading conditions and was effective at differentiating failure parameters between different implant and inserter instrument designs. The mechanical test method developed shows promise in its ability to assess impaction resistance of IBFD/inserter designs and evaluate potential risks of device failure during intraoperative loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We quantified the truss mechanism regarding foot stiffness and the windlass mechanism regarding the movement coordination between the foot arch and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. We aimed to clarify the relationship of these mechanisms with propulsive force and static foot alignment. Forty-eight healthy young adults participated and walked at a comfortable speed. The ground reaction force (GRF), ankle power, and sagittal plane motion of the foot arch and MTP joint were recorded using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. The vertical GRF and foot arch motion were used to quantify foot stiffness as the truss coefficient, and the foot arch and first MTP joint were used to quantify movement coordination as the windlass coefficient. The Foot Posture Index (FPI) and arch height index (AHI) were used to assess static foot alignment. A canonical correlation analysis was performed using the foot- and gait-related index group, and then a single-correlation analysis was performed. The canonical correlation analysis showed that a composite variable consisting of FPI, AHI, and the truss coefficient was related to the anterior GRF (A-GRF) and ankle power. The truss coefficient was positively correlated with A-GRF and ankle power, whereas the windlass coefficient was positively correlated with ankle power. Therefore, the truss and windlass coefficients can be used as indices to evaluate foot function, suggesting that maintaining foot stiffness and foot arch coordination with the first MTP joint is important for propulsion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirteen well-trained male swimmers (21.2 ± 2.0 years) swam the front-crawl for 15 m at a target velocity of 1.20 m s-1 while holding one of three lung-volume levels: maximal inspiration (MAX), maximal expiration (MIN), and intermediate between these (MID). The three-dimensional positions of 25 reflective markers attached to each participant's body were recorded using an underwater motion capture system and then used to estimate the body's CoM. The swimming velocity and the vertical CoM position relative to the water's surface were calculated and averaged for one stroke cycle. Stroke rate, stroke length, kick rate, kick amplitude, kick velocity, and trunk inclination were also calculated for one stroke cycle. Swimming velocity was statistically comparable among the three different lung-volume levels (ICC [2,3] = 0.875). The vertical CoM position was significantly decreased with the lower lung-volume level (MAX: -0.152 ± 0.009 m, MID: -0.163 ± 0.009 m, MIN: -0.199 ± 0.007 m, P < 0.001). Stroke rate, kick rate, kick amplitude, kick velocity, and trunk inclination were significantly higher in MIN than in MAX and MID, whereas the stroke length was significantly lower (all P < 0.05). These results indicate that a lower lung-volume level during submaximal front-crawl swimming induces a lower vertical CoM position that is accompanied by a modulation of the swimming kinematics to overcome the increased drag arising from a larger projected frontal area.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Eighteen adult male amateur soccer players (24.0 ± 4.1 years old) were assessed. Three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction force were measured. A 6-degrees-of-freedom model was assumed, comprising the upper trunk, lower trunk, pelvis, thigh, shank and foot, and the thoraco-lumbar, lumbo-pelvic, hip, knee, and ankle joints. Angular kinematics and joint moments were computed. Power flow analysis was done by calculating the joint powers (to describe joint-to-segments energy transfers) and the proximal and distal segment powers (to describe segment-to-segment transfers). Power, kinematic and kinetic time series were presented to describe the energy flows' directions. The total mechanical energy expenditure (TMEE) at each joint was also calculated. The TMEEs pointed to substantial energy expenditure at the trunk (27% of the summed work produced by the analyzed joints). In the initial phases of kicking, the trunk generates downward energy flows from the upper to the lower trunk and from the lower trunk to the pelvis, and then to the lower limb, sequentially, which favors angular motions for ball contact. There is a formation and release of a tension arc only at the hip joint, and deceleration of the segments slightly sooner than ball contact, differently from theoretical accounts. There are energy flows, hitherto unknown, among the trunk, pelvis and kick limb, revealing mechanical strategies of kicking.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to analyze mechanical performance and mechanical losses across different sets and repetitions of unilateral leg extensions under flywheel loading conditions.


METHODS
In a cross-over design, 23 physically active participants executed 3 sets of 30 repetitions using two different loads. Angular speed, angular acceleration and power were monitored, and mean and peak values of these variables were calculated for each set of repetitions. We analyzed time-course differences every five repetitions (described as 'clusters'). Differences in the mechanical profile for Load by Set and in the mechanical losses for Load by Set by Cluster repetitions were analyzed using an ANOVA repeated measures test. A Principal Components (PC) analysis was also conducted.


RESULTS
Only peak acceleration showed a significant Set by Load interaction (p = 0.006) in mechanical performance. At the intra-set level, all consecutive clusters showed a significant decrement in all variables, but with different magnitudes (speed < acceleration < power). Although all variables showed significant Set by Cluster and Load by Cluster interactions, only the acceleration variables showed a significant Set by Load interaction (p < 0.05). All the variables showed a single PC. Higher fatigue was found around the concentric peak for each variable.


CONCLUSIONS
The most sensitive variable for detecting fatigue using real-time feedback seems to be the angular acceleration of the flywheel. Peak acceleration can be used to monitor training workload and training volume in real time in leg extension exercises using flywheel training devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The inertial measurement units (IMUs) due to its portability, occlusion free, larger capturing area and faster set up preparation, present an alternative to the optical motion capture systems (OS) considered a reference criterion system, however the degree of accuracy is task specific. This study aimed to compare the concurrent validity of a IMUs (Xsens MVN system) with an OS (Qualisys AB) for measuring upper and lower limb kinematics. Variables were evaluated during the forehand drive acceleration phase performed by 29 participants. The results demonstrated an excellent coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) values (CMC ≥ 0.95), for the majority of the variables with exception of shoulder in the anteroposterior plane (CMC: 0.85), and elbow in the axial plane (CMC: 0.79). Root-mean-square error (RMSE) were considered from good to tolerable (1.5° ≤ RMSE ≤ 6.7°), with exception of the elbow joint angle in transverse plane (RMSE: 13.1°). One dimensional (1D) statistical parametrical mapping (SPM) demonstrated good agreement between the two systems, with exception of elbow in transverse plane.

During the buffering phase, both forelimbs touch the ground and compact quickly to absorb most of the impact energy. However, the adjustment of the joint angles of the forelimb and the induced cushioning effect during the landing process have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we statistically summarized the angular displacements of forelimb joints with respect to landing velocities by using a high-speed motion capture system. It is found many joint angles were linearly influenced by landing velocity at both ground touching moment and maximum compression moment. Moreover, the double-peak pattern of ground reactive force was measured, which attributes to the forelimb landing and the followed abdomen/hindlimb landing. Before the appearance of the first peak, the compression of the forelimb and the reactive force revealed a linear relationship regardless of velocity, implying that the forelimbs act as a constant stiffness spring in landing. Accordingly, a simple spring-mass model was proposed and verified by simulation for forelimb cushioning of the frog. We anticipate our achievements to inspire the design of future landing mechanisms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recently, great progress has been made in investigating the physical mechanism of OSAS development and treatment using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, previous studies always neglected the oral cavity artificially in the patient's upper airway CFD model, but did not give any specific explanation. The oral cavity effect on the OSAS upper airway flow is still a matter of unclear. This paper reconstructed the patient-specific upper airway models based on the cone beam computed tomography images of ten children subjects (seven boys and three girls) and used CFD to simulate both the steady and unsteady expiration and inspiration states in the upper airway model with or without the oral cavity. A series of pressure measurement experiments based on the in vitro 1:1 scaled airway model were performed to validate the reliability of the present CFD methods. Finally, the CFD results indicate that the open oral cavity is almost a region of flow stasis with constant pressure, and both the upper airway aerodynamics with and without the oral cavity have the similar trends, with the maximum average relative difference less than 6%. The present study shows that the open oral cavity causes very little impacts on the upper airway flow of the children patients with OSAS using the nasal respiration only, and confirms the reasonability of ignoring the oral cavity for CFD simulation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite the best practices employed in design and manufacturing of modern ventricular assist devices, complexity and modular nature of these systems often introduces internal steps and crevices in the flow path which can serve as nidus for thrombus formation. Thrombotic potential is influenced by multiple factors including the characteristics of the flow and surface chemistry of the biomaterial. This study explored these elements in the setting of blood flow over a micro-crevice using a multi-constituent numerical model of thrombosis.

Mechanotransduction between a neuronal cell and an ECM is mediated by neuronal cell receptors such as integrin and neural cellular adhesion molecule. In this study, using molecular dynamics, we investigate the interaction energies between peptoid and neuronal cell receptors, and also study the effect of peptoid bundle size. We investigate the interaction surface between peptoid bundles and neuronal cell receptors, integrin and neural cellular adhesion molecule, using the solvent accessible surface area method to find the influence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues of the peptoid chain. We find the free energy landscape using the umbrella sampling method and then evaluate the potential mean force (PMF) and unbinding force during the dissociation between peptoid bundles and neuronal cell receptors. We find that the peptoid bundles have a higher affinity for the neuronal cell receptors, however increasing the size of peptoid bundles increases the affinity for integrin and neural cell adhesion molecule. PMF data for peptoid and neuronal cell receptor dissociation indicates that binding force increases as the size of the peptoid bundle increases. The higher binding strength during peptoid and neuronal cell receptors are due to the hydrophobic residue cluster area in the binding region. These findings will provide a better insight into using peptoid as an ECM.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Hence, cell-cell communications are pivotal for organ physiology and pathogenesis. Every cell lineage of an organ responds differently to a specific signal due to its unique receptibility and signal interpretation capacity. These distinct cellular responses generate a system-scale signaling network that helps in generating a specific organ phenotype. Although the reciprocal biochemical signal exchange between non-identical neighboring cells is known to be an essential factor for organ functioning, if, then how, mechanical cues incite these signals is not yet quite explored. Cells within organ tissues experience multiple mechanical forces, such as stretching, bending, compression, and shear stress. Forms and magnitudes of mechanical forces influence biochemical signaling in a cell-specific manner. Additionally, the biophysical state of acellular extracellular matrix (ECM) can transmit exclusive mechanical cues to specific cells of an organ. As it scaffolds heterotypic cells and tissues in close proximities, therefore, ECM can easily be contemplated as a mechanical conduit for signal exchange among them. However, force-stimulated signal transduction is not always physiological, aberrant force sensing by tissue-resident cells can transduce anomalous signals to each other, and potentially can promote pathological phenotypes. Herein, I attempt to put forward a perspective on how mechanical forces may influence signal transductions among heterotypic cell populations and how they feedback each other to achieve a transient or perpetual alteration in metazoan organs. A mechanistic insight of organ scale mechanotransduction can emanate the possibility of finding potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies to deal with pathogenesis and organ regeneration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Conventional and true mechanical axes (the line from the femoral head to the lowest point of the calcaneus) were evaluated on unipedal standing long-leg radiographs in the KA, MA, and OA groups. Results were compared using analysis of variance. The OA group showed a lateral loading pattern in the mid- and rearfoot, while the MA group showed a medial rearfoot loading pattern during walking. On the contrary, the KA and Healthy groups showed an almost equal pressure distribution between the medial and lateral rearfoot. Moreover, although both mechanical axes in the KA group passed through the knee more medially, a more neutral alignment was achieved in the true mechanical axis compared to that in the MA group. KA-TKA results in more neutral weight-bearing through the true mechanical axis and allows patients to walk while maintaining medial and lateral rearfoot pressure more evenly than MA-TKA.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A total of twelve healthy male subjects (age: 27 ± 4 years) participated and were required to stay at rest (0% MVC) and perform isometric submaximal plantar flexion contractions (20%, 40%, 60% of MVC) on a dynamometer. Young's modulus of triceps surae muscles and the adjoining aponeuroses between gastrocnemii and soleus at the proximal and distal sites were obtained in the longitudinal direction (along muscle's line of action) during at rest and submaximal plantar flexions. Additionally, Young's modulus of adjoining aponeuroses in the transverse direction at the distal sites was also calculated. Young's modulus of LG (lateral gastrocnemius), SOL-lat (lateral part of soleus) and LPS (superficial aponeurosis of LG) at the proximal site showed significant (p < 0.001) graded increase response to the submaximal contraction levels. Besides, in the lateral side, significant differences in the Young's modulus of aponeuroses were observed between longitudinal and transverse directions at rest and during contractions (p < 0.002).

Despite this, there is limited in vivo data to quantify how obesity influences the mechanical function of intervertebral discs (IVD) in response to activities of daily living. Recently, our lab has developed methodologies to non-invasively measure in vivo IVD deformation resulting from activities of daily living using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and solid modeling techniques. This pilot study expands on these methodologies to assess how BMI influences IVD deformation following treadmill walking in eight asymptomatic individuals. Ordinary least squares regression analyses revealed a statistically significant relationship between BMI and compressive deformation (strain (%)) in the L5-S1 IVD (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.05). This relationship was weaker in the L3-L4 (R2 = 0.28, p > 0.05) and L4-L5 IVDs (R2 = 0.28, p > 0.05). Importantly, no relationship between pre-exercise disc height and BMI was identified (p > 0.05). Therefore, the results of this study suggest that BMI may alter the mechanical response of lumbar spine IVDs, particularly at the L5-S1 level. Furthermore, the observed relationship between increased BMI and IVD compressive deformation, in the absence of a detected relationship between pre-exercise disc height and BMI, suggests that changes in IVD mechanical function may be more sensitive to alterations in disc health than static clinical imaging alone.

Current surgical interventions primarily focus on airway restoration to stabilize the patient, with restoration of vocal function usually being a secondary consideration. Due to laryngeal fracture, asymmetric vertical misalignment of the left or right vocal fold (VF) in the inferior-superior direction often occurs. This affects VF closure and can lead to a weak, breathy voice requiring increased vocal effort. It is unclear, however, how much vertical VF misalignment can be tolerated before voice quality degrades significantly. To address this need, the influence of inferior-superior VF displacement on phonation is investigated in 1.0mm increments using synthetic, self-oscillating VF models in a physiologically-representative facility. Acoustic (SPL, frequency, H1-H2, jitter, and shimmer), kinematic (amplitude and phase differences), and aerodynamic parameters (flow rate and subglottal pressure) are investigated as a function of inferior-superior vertical displacement. Significant findings include that once the inferior-superior medial length of the VF is surpassed, sustained phonation degrades precipitously, becoming severely pathological. If laryngeal reconstruction approaches can ensure VF contact is maintained during phonation (i.e., vertical displacement doesn't surpass VF medial length), improved vocal outcomes are expected.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In comparison with the criterion CM measurements for mean horizontal velocity, the filtered head data had the best 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.999 - 1.000), the least bias (-0.006 m/s), and the lowest root mean square difference (0.024 m/s). The filtered head condition also had the best 95% CI for ICC for maximum and minimum horizontal velocities during the stride (>0.988) and the lowest bias (-0.001 m/s and -0.003 m/s, respectively).

Previous studies have attempted to map local tissue stiffness by sectioning the disc and performing mechanical testing on these discrete tissue units, which is technically challenging and may bias the results. Shear wave elastography (SWE) represents a nondestructive alternative that can provide spatially continuous elasticity estimates. We investigated the feasibility of SWE for human intervertebral disc elasticity mapping in a laboratory setting. To this end, global spinal segment mechanical behavior was determined in 6 loading directions and served as ground truth data for the validation of the approach. Subsequently, the cranial spinal vertebra was removed and shear wave elastographic scans of the IVD were acquired. SWE-measurements were reconstructed into three-dimensional elastographic maps, discretized into distinct IVD regions and correlated with global segment mechanical parameters. SWE-derived Young's modulus estimates were compared among different regions and as a function of their state of degeneration. We found annulus shear wave speed to be moderately correlated with segment mechanical behavior irrespective of the loading direction whereas shear wave speed in the nucleus pulposus showed a very weak association (mean (SD) absolute Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.51 (0.14) and 0.17 (0.12), respectively).

This study examined whether ""hang"", an extended period of greatly reduced or zero vertical velocity of the head and trunk created by inter-segmental interactions, would be seen during skilled volleyball player spike jumps.


METHOD
Fifteen skilled volleyball hitters (eight men and seven women, age 23.26 ± 3.22 years, height 1.86 ± 0.08 m, mass 77.53 ± 10.45 kg) performed spike jumps in two hitting conditions, flexing their knees during flight as much as possible and not flexing their knees during flight. We analyzed the effect of knee flexion on the vertical and temporal components of the trajectories of the head, trunk, legs and wrist of the hitting arm to study the existence of ""hang"" and its underlying mechanisms.


RESULTS
With knee flexion, unlike no knee flexion, the head and trunk (HT) demonstrated ""hang"", characterized by a longer time of near-zero vertical velocity of the head and trunk near mid-flight (p < 0.001). Analysis of the influence of the timing and extent of knee flexion on the HT center of mass trajectory revealed significant effects (p < 0.001).Women demonstrated longer ""hang"" during flight than men. Athletes in this study hit the ball later in flight in the ""hang"" condition (p < 0.001).

A circle-based model was created to simulate articular surfaces of the tibial insert and condyles of the femoral component and to demonstrate the error. Equations relating the error to radii of tibial and femoral articular surfaces were derived. The magnitude of the error was estimated for common low-conforming TKA components by determining radii using best-fit circles to approximate curvature of articular surfaces. Error in AP tibial insert contact locations is caused by the slope of the tibial articular surface and the magnitude increases with increasing slope and increasing radius of the femoral condyle. For radii approximating articular surfaces of common low-conforming components, relative errors range from 45% to 109%. The circle-based model effectively demonstrates the cause of the large error in using lowest points to indicate AP tibial insert contact locations and enables an estimate of relative error. Because relative error exceeds 45%, the lowest point method should not be used to indicate the AP tibial insert contact locations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In one model it is assumed that ground reaction forces are directed to a point (virtual pivot point) above the center of mass during the whole stride. This was observed in several experimental investigations, but only for the single support phase. It has not yet been concretely considered whether humans use the same stabilization strategy during the double support phase. For analyzing this, nine volunteers walked at self-selected speed while kinetic and kinematic data were measured. We found that in contrast to the single support phase, where the virtual pivot point was significantly above the center of mass, in the double support phase of human walking the ground reaction forces point around the center of mass with a small spread (R2=92.5%). The different heights of the virtual pivot point in the different support phases could be caused by the vertical movement of the center of mass, which has a lower amplitude in the double support phase. This is also reflected in the ground reaction forces, whereby the ratio of the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces can explain the height of the virtual pivot point. In the double support phase the ratio is shifted in favor of the horizontal component compared to the single support phase, because of a shorter contact time and a delayed braking impulse. Thus, the whole body seems to rotate around the center of mass, which presumably minimizes required energy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this in vitro study, we examine the effect of the treatment approach on the unsteady hemodynamics and blood perfusion to the upper vessel's in models of an aortic arch aneurysm, and of the three common repair approaches: open-chest surgical repair, chimney, and hybrid approach. A particle image velocimetry method was used to quantify the unsteady hemodynamics in the four models simulated in a mock circulatory loop, to evaluate unsteady hemodynamic parameters and measure perfusion to the brain and the upper body. According to the findings, in terms of perfusion to the brain and upper body, the surgery model has the highest flow rate comparing to the other models in most heart-rate conditions. It also shows oscillatory parameters in the upper vessels which in normal arteries are correlated with a better arterial function. Between the two endovascular procedures, the hybrid model exhibits slightly better hemodynamic characteristics than the chimney model, with lower shear stresses and more oscillatory flow and WSS in the upper vessels. The hybrid model had lower perfusion flow rates to upper vessels during rest conditions (90BPM). However, unlike the other models, perfusion in the hybrid model increased with heart rate, thus at 135 BPM, it results in flow rate to upper vessels similar to that of the chimney model. The results of this study may shed light on future endograft' design and placement techniques.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether EMG-biofeedback is effective for improving the range of motion (ROM), physical function, and pain relief in patients after knee. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of EMG-biofeedback after any knee surgery were retrieved from EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest. This review identified 773 unique studies, and six RCTs were in the final meta-analysis.

Therefore, muscle stiffness should be reduced through stretching. The aim of this study was to determine the effective stretching position of the coracobrachialis muscle using ultrasound shear wave elastography imaging to evaluate the stiffness of individual muscles. Eighteen healthy young men participated in this study. The shear modulus of the coracobrachialis muscle was measured at the following eight shoulder positions: i) 20° abduction (Rest), ii) maximal external rotation at 90° abduction (ER2), iii) maximal internal rotation at 90° abduction (IR2), iv) maximal flexion (Flex), v) maximal extension (Ext), vi) maximal horizontal abduction at 90° abduction (Hab), vii) maximal horizontal abduction and maximal external rotation at 90° abduction (HabER), and viii) maximal horizontal abduction and maximal internal rotation at 90° abduction (HabIR). The shear modulus in each position was compared with that of Rest using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and a multiple comparison test was performed among the positions that exhibited significant difference. The shear modulus of all stretching positions was significantly higher than that of Rest, except for Flex. Moreover, the shear moduli of IR2, Ext, Hab, HabER, and HabIR were significantly higher than that of ER2. The shear modulus of Ext was significantly higher than that of HabIR. The coracobrachialis muscle could be stretched effectively at IR2, Ext, Hab, HabER, and HabIR.

In contrast, before these cells enter the circulation in the bone marrow or when they recross the endothelium into extravascular tissues of peripheral organs they are fully activated. We review here a multifaceted mechanism mediated by fluid shear stress that can serve to deactivate leukocytes in the circulation. The fluid shear stress controls pseudopod formation via the FPR receptor, the same receptor responsible for pseudopod projection by localized actin polymerization. The bioactivity of macromolecular factors in the blood plasma that interfere with receptor stimulation by fluid flow, such as proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular domain of the receptor or the membrane actions of cholesterol, leads to a defective ability to respond to fluid shear stress by actin depolymerization. The cell reaction to fluid shear involves CD18 integrins, nitric oxide, cGMP and Rho GTPases, is attenuated in the presence of inflammatory mediators and modified by glucocorticoids. The mechanism is abolished in disease models (genetic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) leading to an increased number of activated leukocytes in the circulation with enhanced microvascular resistance and cell entrapment. In addition to their role in binding to biochemical agonists/antagonists, membrane receptors appear to play a second role: to monitor local fluid shear stress levels. The fluid shear stress control of many circulating cell types such as lymphocytes, stem cells, tumor cells remains to be elucidated.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Computational thrombosis simulation is a convenient approach to evaluate the risk of thrombosis for a device. However, thrombosis is a complicated process involving multiple species and reactions. Application of a macroscopic, single-scale computational model for device-induced thrombosis is a cost-effective approach. The current study has refined an existing thrombosis model, which simulated thrombosis by tracing four species in blood: non-activated platelets, activated platelets, surface adherent platelets, and ADP. Platelets are activated mechanically by shear stress, and chemically by ADP. Platelet adhesion occurs on surfaces with low wall shear stress with platelet aggregation inhibited in regions of high shear stress. The study improves the existing thrombosis model by: 1) Modifying the chemical platelet activation function so that ADP activates platelets; 2) Modifying the function describing thrombus deposition and growth to distinguish between thrombus deposition on wall surfaces and thrombus growth on existing thrombus surfaces; 3) Modifying the thrombus breakdown function to allow for thrombus breakdown by shear stress; 4) Modeling blood flow as non-Newtonian. The results show that the inclusion of ADP and the use of a non-Newtonian model improve agreement with experimental data.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Individuals with spinal cord injuries sit for a majority of the time, increasing the risk of developing pressure ulcers in the buttocks and thighs due to large internal stresses. Human body models have been developed to study the formation of pressure ulcers, yet a persistent limitation in these models has been the material properties used to represent the soft tissues in the buttocks and thighs. Specifically, soft tissue material property data have not included wheelchair users, such as those with spinal cord injuries. The goals of this research were 1) to determine the in-vivo material properties of soft tissue in the thighs and buttocks of individuals with spinal cord injuries and 2) compare these to properties obtained from able-bodied people. Results indicated that the proximal and middle thigh regions of those who had a spinal cord injury were softer than the same regions as able-bodied individuals, while the distal thigh regions were stiffer. These findings are vital because they indicate that models developed using properties from able-bodied individuals will not produce internal stress or strain magnitudes that represent individuals who have a spinal cord injury. This information suggests that models should obtain material property data sets from their desired population. Human body models must represent the population being studied if they are to inform clinical assessments and make accurate patient predictions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Youth (ages 8-18 years) with hemiplegic and diplegic CP [Gross Motor Classification System (GMFCS) I-III] and their age (within 12 months) and sex-matched peers performed a modified six-minute-walk-test on a treadmill. Kinematics (Motion Analysis, USA, 240 Hz) and mass-specific gross metabolic rate (GMR; COSMED, Italy) were analyzed for minute two of treadmill walking. Thigh-shank coordination was determined using continuous relative phase (CRP) analysis. GMR was normalized using participant specific Froude numbers (i.e. GMREq). Maximum and minimum CRP deficit angles (CRPMax,CRPMin) were analysed in SPSS (IBM, USA) using paired samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction (p = 0.0125). Associations of knee extension angle deficit (KEDMax) and coordination outcomes with GMREq (log) were assessed using multiple linear regression. Twenty-eight matched pairs were included, demonstrating significantly larger CRPMax for youth with CP [GMFCS I mean pair difference (98.75%CI) 8.2 (-0.1,16.5), P = 0.013; GMFCS II/III 26.1 (2.3,50.0), P = 0.008]. Joint kinematics and coordination outcomes were significantly associated with GMREq (P < 0.001), primarily due to CRPMax (P < 0.001), leading to a 1.7 (95%CI; 1.1, 2.4)% increase in GMREq for every degree increase in CRPMax. These findings indicate an association of thigh-shank coordination deficit severity and increasing metabolic demands of walking in youth with CP. CRP may be a clinically useful predictor of metabolic demands of walking in CP.

Dry needling (DN) is a conservative treatment introduced to alleviate pain and restore function; however, it is invasive and has mixed success. Focused ultrasound (fUS) is a non-invasive technology that directs ultrasound energy into a well-defined focal volume. fUS induces thermal and/or mechanical bioeffects which can be controlled by the choice of ultrasound parameters. fUS could be an alternative to DN for treatment of tendon injuries, but the bioeffects must be established. Thus, the purpose of this pilot study was to compare the effect of DN and fUS on the mechanical properties and cell morphology of 30 ex vivo rat Achilles tendons. Tendons were randomly assigned to sham, DN, or fUS, with 10 tendons per group. Within each group, 5 tendons were evaluated mechanically, and 5 tendons were analyzed histologically. Elastic modulus in the DN (74.05 ± 15.0 MPa) group was significantly lower than sham (149.84 ± 59.1 MPa; p = 0.0094) and fUS (128.84 ± 28.3 MPa; p = 0.0453) groups. Stiffness in DN (329.05 ± 236.8 N/mm; p = 0.0034) and fUS (315.26 ± 68.9 N/mm; p = 0.0027) groups were significantly lower than sham (786.10 ± 238.7 N/mm) group. Histologically, localized necrosis was observed in 3 out of 5 tendons exposed to fUS, with surrounding tissue unharmed; no evidence of cellular injury was observed in DN or sham groups. These results suggest that fUS preserves the mechanical properties of tendon better than DN.

This study focused on the kinematic differences between lifting with and without the exoskeleton (With-Exo and Without-Exo) over three different lifting styles (Freestyle, Squat, and Stoop) and two different box weights (0% and 20% of bodyweight). Twelve young and healthy males (Age 23.5 +/- 4.42 years; Height 179.33 +/- 6.37 cm; Weight 80.4 +/- 5.59 kg) participated in this study. Variables analyzed include the ankle and knee angles and angle between the Shoulder-Hip-Knee (SHK); the shoulder, elbow, and wrist heights; and the lifting speed and acceleration. The relationships between the torso angle, SHK angle, center of mass of the torso, torso torque, box height, as well as electromyography (EMG) data from a related study were also analyzed. On average, wearing the exoskeleton resulted in a 1.5 degree increase in ankle dorsiflexion, a 2.6 degree decrease in knee flexion, and a decrease of 2.3 degrees in SHK angle. Subjects' shoulder, elbow, and wrist heights were slightly higher while wearing the exoskeleton, and they lifted slightly more slowly while wearing the exoskeleton. Subjects moved more quickly while bending down as compared to standing up, and with the 0% bodyweight box as compared to the 20% bodyweight box. The values for Freestyle lifts generally fell in between Squat and Stoop lift styles or were not significantly different from Squat.

The effect of angle and rate of indentation on displacing the anterior vaginal wall (AVW) was studied in control and prolapse patients. Following IRB approval, an automated artificial finger equipped with a calibrated piezoresistive sensor at its tip was used to induce 3-second AVW deformation sequences (10°, 15°, and 20° indentation). Measurements were taken in patients in supine position, either awake in clinic or under anesthesia in the operating room (OR). The real time voltage output of a sensor (linearly proportional to the reaction force) was recorded for each motion profile to calculate key parameters: baseline voltages, amplitude changes over indentation intervals, and slopes of indentation curves. 23 women (9 controls and 14 prolapse) were studied, 6 in clinic and 17 in OR. No differences in mean reproducibility was noted across groups. There was a significant difference in sensor output based on selected motion profile parameters between different degrees of indentation for all women (p < 0.001) and in baseline voltage between age-matched and non-age-matched controls (p < 0.02). From these findings, we can conclude that indentation reaction properties of prolapsed and non-prolapsed AVW can be objectively measured using an operator-independent artificial finger with significant differences between patient groups.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet, the dynamics of actin filamentous network is still a subject of debate. Here we show that hydrodynamic interactions may significantly alter the time scale of actin network deformation. The alteration may be easily in the range of 2-20 fold depending on the structural conformations and scales of interest. We show that for a single fiber, hydrodynamic interactions between the cytoskeletal mesh-sized segments can change the net force by up to 7 folds. We also demonstrate that cytoskeletal relaxation times are underestimated if hydrodynamic interaction effects are ignored, but bending mode shapes are not appreciably influenced. Ignoring hydrodynamic interactions can result in up to 20-fold overestimation of shear loss modulus in the 2 μm range we investigated. Moreover, in agreement with experimental studies, our models explain a highly length scale dependent loss modulus. Taken together, our data suggest that including hydrodynamic interactions is key to proper modeling and analysis of actin dynamics at any scales and dimensions, and therefore must not be neglected in future models and experimental analyses of cytoskeletal dynamics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the skin-based markers may not reflect the underlying bone movement, a source of error known as soft tissue artifact (STA). This study examined STA during wrist motion by evaluating the agreement between OMC and biplanar videoradiography (BVR). Nine subjects completed 7 different wrist motion tasks: doorknob rotation to capture supination and pronation, radial-ulnar deviation, flexion-extension, circumduction, hammering, and pitcher pouring. BVR and OMC captured the motion simultaneously. Wrist kinematics were quantified using helical motion parameters of rotation and translation, and Bland-Altman analysis quantified the mean difference (bias) and 95% limit of agreement (LOA). The rotational bias of doorknob pronation, a median bias of -4.9°, was significantly larger than the flexion-extension (0.7°, p < 0.05) and radial-ulnar deviation (1.8°, p < 0.01) tasks. The rotational LOA range was significantly smaller in the flexion-extension task (5.9°) compared to pitcher (11.6°, p < 0.05) and doorknob pronation (17.9°, p < 0.05) tasks. The translation bias did not differ between tasks. The translation LOA range was significantly larger in circumduction (9.8°) compared to the radial-ulnar deviation (6.3°, p < 0.05) and pitcher (3.4°, p < 0.05) tasks.

Although the International Society of Biomechanics defines a standard method of assigning local coordinate systems for the ankle joint complex, standards for the tibiotalar and subtalar joints are lacking. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize and appraise the existing literature that (1) defined coordinate systems for the tibia, talus, and/or calcaneus or (2) assigned kinematic definitions for the tibiotalar and/or subtalar joints. A systematic literature search was developed with search results limited to English Language from 2006 through 2020. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers based on title and abstract. Methodological quality was evaluated using a modified assessment tool. Following screening, 52 articles were identified as having met inclusion criteria. Methodological assessment of these articles varied in quality from 61 to 97. Included articles adopted primary methods for defining coordinate systems that included: (1) anatomical coordinate system (ACS) based on individual bone landmarks and/or geometric shapes, (2) orthogonal principal axes, and (3) interactive closest point (ICP) registration. Common methods for calculating kinematics included: (1) joint coordinate system (JCS) to calculate rotation and translation, (2) Cardan/Euler sequences, and (3) inclination and deviation angles for helical angles.

The disinsertion of the PM would need increased contributions from intact shoulder musculature to generate shoulder torques. This study aimed to identify neuromuscular compensation strategies adopted by subpectoral implant breast reconstruction patients using novel muscle synergy analyses. Fourteen patients treated bilaterally with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction (>2.5 years post-reconstruction) were compared to ten healthy controls. Surface electromyography was obtained from sixteen shoulder muscles as participants generated eight three-dimensional (3D) shoulder torques in five two-dimensional arm postures bilaterally. Non-negative matrix factorization revealed the muscle synergies utilized by each experimental group on the dominant and non-dominant limbs, and the normalized similarity index assessed group differences in overall synergy structure. Bilateral subpectoral implant patients exhibited similar shoulder strength to healthy controls on the dominant and non-dominant arms. Our results suggest that 3D shoulder torque is driven by three shoulder muscle synergies in both healthy participants and subpectoral implant patients. Two out of three synergies were more similar than is expected by chance between the groups on the non-dominant arm, whereas only one synergy is more similar than is expected by chance on the dominant arm. While bilateral shoulder strength is maintained following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, a closer analysis of the muscle synergy patterns underlying 3D shoulder torque generation reveals that subpectoral implant patients adopt compensatory neuromuscular strategies only with the dominant arm.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

RBs form through endochondral ossification and protect the inner organs, and IBs form through intramembranous ossification within the myosepta and play a role in force transmission and propulsion during locomotion. Based on previous findings suggesting that IBs show a much higher ability for fracture strain compared to mammalian bones, this study aims to investigate whether this ability is general to teleost bones or specific to IBs. We analyzed RBs and IBs of 25 North Atlantic Herring fish. RBs were analyzed using micro-mechanical tensile testing and micro-computed tomography, and both RB and IB were additionally analyzed with Raman spectroscopy. Based on our previous results from IB, we found that RBs are more elastically deformable (on average, 50% higher yield strain and 115% higher elastic work) and stronger (55% higher fracture stress) than values reported for IBs. However, these differences were neither associated with a higher Young's modulus nor a higher degree of mineralization in RBs. Astonishingly, RBs and IBs showed similar fracture strains (12-15% on average, reaching up to 20%), reflecting a much higher ability for tensile deformation than reported for mammalian bone, and further highlighting the biomimetic potential of teleost fish bones for inspiring innovative biomaterials.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Muscle synergy can be utilized as an index to determine muscle coordination. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the muscle coordination among different shoulder muscles underlying basic shoulder movements based on muscle synergy. Thirteen men performed 14 multiplanar shoulder movements; five movements were associated with elevation and lowering, while five were associated with horizontal abduction and adduction. The four additional movements were simple rotations at different positions. Muscle activity was measured from 12 muscle portions using surface electromyography. Using the dimensionality reduction technique, synergies were extracted first for each movement separately (""separate"" synergies), and then for the global dataset (containing all movements; ""global"" synergies). The least number that provided 90% of the variance accounted for was selected as the optimal number of synergies. For each subject, approximately two separate synergies and approximately six global synergies with small residual values were extracted from the separate and global electromyography datasets, respectively.

The current study analysed the mechanical properties of the triceps surae (TS) MTU in 10 young (YS; 22 ± 3 yrs) and 10 older (OS; age 65 ± 8 yrs; i.e. master) (inter)national level sprinters and 11 young recreationally active adults (YC; 23 ± 3 yrs) to detect possible non-uniformities in muscle and tendon adaptation due to habitual mechanical loading and ageing. Triceps surae muscle strength, tendon stiffness and maximal tendon strain were assessed in both legs during maximal voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions via dynamometry and ultrasonography. Irrespective of the leg, OS and YC in comparison to YS demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) lower TS muscle strength and tendon stiffness, with no differences between OS and YC. Furthermore, no group differences were detected in the maximal tendon strain (average of both legs: OS 3.7 ± 0.8%, YC 4.4 ± 0.8% and YS 4.3 ± 0.9%) as well as in the inter-limb symmetry indexes in muscle strength, tendon stiffness and maximal tendon strain (range across groups: -5.8 to 4.9%; negative value reflects higher value for the non-preferred leg). Thus, the findings provide no clear evidence for a disruption in the TS MTU uniformity in master sprinters, demonstrating that ageing tendons can maintain their integrity to meet the increased functional demand due to elite sports.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The model is coupled with a sharp-interface immersed boundary based incompressible flow solver to efficiently simulate the fluid-structure interaction. A total of 19 cases of flow through aortic valves with varying degrees of reduced leaflet motion (RLM) are considered. The characteristics of the aortic jet and the consequent aorta wall loading patterns are analyzed. Our results show that asymmetric RLM tilts the aortic jet and leads to large reverse and recirculating flow regions downstream from leaflets with restricted mobility. The changes in flow patterns increase wall pressure and shear stress fluctuations, and result in asymmetric oscillating shear on the aorta wall. These findings have implications for auscultation based diagnosis of this condition as well as the health of the aorta.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Microdamage accumulation, in response to repetitive loading of the tendon, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of patellar tendinopathy. This damage presents mechanically as a reduction in Young's modulus and an increase in residual strain. In this study, 19 human patellar tendon samples underwent cyclic testing in load control until failure, segmented by four ramped tests where digital image correlation (DIC) was used to assess anterior surface strain distributions. Ramped tests were performed prior to cyclic testing and at timepoints corresponding to 10%, 20%, and 30% of cyclic stiffness reduction. Young's modulus significantly decreased and cyclic energy dissipation significantly increased over the course of cyclic testing. The DIC analysis illustrated a heterogeneous strain distribution, with strain concentrations increasing in magnitude and size over the course of cyclic testing. Peak stress and initial peak strain magnitudes significantly correlated with the number of cycles to failure (r2 = 0.65 and r2 = 0.57, respectively, p < 0.001); however, the rates of peak cyclic strain and modulus loss displayed the highest correlations with the number of cycles to failure (r2 = 96% and r2 = 86%, respectively, p < 0.001). The high correlation between the rates of peak cyclic strain and modulus loss suggest that non-invasive methods to continuously monitor tendon strain may provide meaningful predictions of overuse injury in the patellar tendon.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here, we performed image-based flow simulations of 3 human fetal left ventricles (LV), and investigated the hypothetical scenario where the sizes of the hearts are scaled down, leading to reduced Reynolds number, to emulate earlier fetal stages. The shape and motion of the LV were retained over the scaling to isolate and understand the effects of length scaling on its fluid dynamics. We observed an interesting cut-off point in Reynolds number (Re), across which the dependency of LV wall shear stress (WSS) on Re changed. This was in line with classical fluid mechanic theory where skin friction coefficient exhibited first a decreasing trend and then a plateauing trend with increasing Re. Below this cut-off point, viscous effects dominated, stifling the formation of LV diastolic vorticity structures, and WSS was roughly independent of Reynolds number. However, above this cut-off, inertial effects dominated to cause diastolic vortex ring formation and detachment, and to cause WSS to scale linearly with Reynolds number. Results suggested that this transition point is found at approximately 11 weeks of gestation. Since WSS is thought to be a biomechanical stimuli for growth, this may have implications on normal fetal heart growth and malformation diseases like Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims to quantify STAs in 3D for foot markers and their effect on multi-segment foot kinematics as calculated by the Oxford and Rizzoli Foot Models (OFM, RFM). Fifteen subjects with asymptomatic feet were seated on a custom-made loading device on a computed tomography (CT) table, with a combined OFM and RFM marker set on their right foot. One unloaded reference CT-scan with neutral foot position was performed, followed by 9 loaded CT-scans at different foot positions. The 3D-displacement (i.e. STA) of each marker in the underlying bone coordinate system between the reference scan and other scans was calculated. Subsequently, segment orientations and joint angles were calculated from the marker positions according to OFM and RFM definitions with and without STAs. The differences in degrees were defined as the errors caused by the marker displacements. Markers on the lateral malleolus and proximally on the posterior aspect of the calcaneus showed the largest STAs. The hindfoot-shank joint angle was most affected by STAs in the most extreme foot position (40° plantar flexion) in the sagittal plane for RFM (mean: 6.7°, max: 11.8°) and the transverse plane for OFM (mean: 3.9°, max: 6.8°). This study showed that STAs introduce clinically relevant errors in multi-segment foot kinematics. Moreover, it identified marker locations that are most affected by STAs, suggesting that their use within multi-segment foot models should be reconsidered.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Our purpose was to use induced velocity analysis to investigate which joint(s) made the largest contribution to the velocity of a pitched ball. Pitching data were collected from six elite high school-aged pitchers with no history of arm injury. Participants threw a fastball pitch from the windup on flat ground. Data were collected using seven Vicon 612 cameras (250 Hz) and three AMTI force platforms (1000 Hz). A 14-segment biomechanical model (feet, legs, thighs, pelvis, a combined thorax-abdomen-head, i.e., trunk, upper arms, forearms, and hands) was implemented in Visual3D as a dynamic link library built using SD/Fast (PTC) software. Model-generated induced velocity of the ball was validated against ball velocity obtained from a calibrated radar gun. Velocity induced torques at the shoulder just prior to release, and elbow during the cocking phase, contributed 31.0% and 18.1%, respectively, to forward ball velocity. The centripetal/Coriolis effects from the upper arm and forearm velocities made the largest contribution to ball velocity (average 57.8%), but the source of these effects are unknown. The lower extremities and trunk made little direct contribution to pitched ball velocity.

However, models of coronary vessel remodelling usually make some strong assumptions about the effects of a local narrowing on the flow through the narrowed vessel. Here, we test the effects of local flow dynamics on the predictions of an in-stent restenosis (ISR) model. A previously developed 2D model of ISR is coupled to a 1D model of coronary blood flow. Then, two different assumptions are tested. The first assumption is that the vasculature is always able to adapt, and the volumetric flow rate through the narrowed vessel is kept constant. The second, alternative, assumption is that the vasculature does not adapt at all, and the ratio of the pressure drop to the flow rate (hydrodynamic resistance) stays the same throughout the whole process for all vessels unaffected by the stenosis, and aortic or venous blood pressure does not change either. Then, the dynamics are compared for different locations in coronary tree for two different reendothelization scenarios. The assumptions of constant volumetric flow rate (absolute vascular adaptation) versus constant aortic pressure drop and no adaptation do not significantly affect the growth dynamics for most locations in the coronary tree, and the differences can only be observed at the locations where a strong alternative flow pathway is present. On the other hand, the difference between locations is significant, which is consistent with small vessel size being a risk factor for restenosis. These results suggest that the assumption of a constant flow is a good approximation for ISR models dealing with the typical progression of ISR in the most often stented locations such as the proximal parts of left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Their suitability for deployment in different clinical contexts is assessed based on their deformation characteristics. Self-expanding stainless steel stents possess superior collapse resistance compared to Nitinol stents. Consequently, they may be more reliable to treat diseases like May-Thurner syndrome in which resistance against a concentrated (pinching) force applied on the stent is needed to prevent collapse. Braided design applies a larger radial pressure particularly for vessels of diameter smaller than 75% of its nominal diameter, making it suitable for a long lesion with high recoil. Z design has the least foreshortening, which aids in accurate deployment. Nitinol stents are more compliant than their stainless steel counterparts, which indicates their suitability in veins.

Although most of the mechanical properties of human menisci have been characterized, to our knowledge, its dynamic shear properties have never been reported. Moreover, little is known about meniscal shear properties in relation to tissue structure and composition. This is crucial to understand mechanisms of meniscal injury, as well as, in regenerative medicine, for the design and development of tissue engineered scaffolds mimicking the native tissue. Hence, the objective of this study was to characterize the dynamic and equilibrium shear properties of human meniscus in relation to its anisotropy and composition. Specimens were prepared from the axial and the circumferential anatomical planes of medial and lateral menisci. Frequency sweeps and stress relaxation tests yielded storage (G') and loss moduli (G″), and equilibrium shear modulus (G). Correlations of moduli with water, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and collagen content were investigated. The meniscus exhibited viscoelastic behavior. Dynamic shear properties were related to tissue composition: negative correlations were found between G', G″ and G, and meniscal water content; positive correlations were found for G' and G″ with GAG and collagen (only in circumferential samples). Circumferential samples, with collagen fibers orthogonal to the shear plane, exhibited superior dynamic mechanical properties, with G' ~70 kPa and G″ ~10 kPa, compared to those of the axial plane ~15 kPa and ~1 kPa, respectively.

Fourteen professional rowers (6 healthy and 8 with CLBP) participated in this study. 3D kinematic of upper trunk (UT), lower trunk (LT), lower back (LB), and pelvis segments during ergometer rowing at 70% and 100% of peak power were captured. The adjacent segments' coordination and CV were calculated using modified vector coding method. The results showed that segments' range of motion increased in both groups with increasing intensity, especially in CLBP rowers. CLBP rowers showed significantly lower: LT dominancy in LT/LB coordination at both intensities; anti-phase pattern in LB/Pelvis coordination at 100% intensity; UT/LT CV in early recovery, and significantly higher LB/Pelvis CV in final recovery and catch position (p < 0.05). Moreover, both groups showed significantly lower UT dominancy for UT/LT coordination in sagittal plane; higher anti-phase pattern in frontal plane; lower UT/LT CV in sagittal plane, lower LT/LB CV in sagittal and transverse plane, lower LB/Pelvis CV in frontal plane in trunk preparation phase, and a lower UT/LT CV in frontal plane for acceleration phase at 100% versus 70% intensity. In conclusion rowers with CLBP cannot adapt their coordination pattern and its variability with increase in intensity, and the movement in the kinematic chain from pelvis to UT stops in spine-pelvic junction.

Previous modeling studies have evaluated femoral strains in THA-implanted femurs under gait loads including both physiological hip contact force and femoral muscle forces. However, experimental replication of the complex muscle forces during activities of daily living (ADLs) is difficult for in vitro assessment of femoral implant or fixation hardware. Alternatively, cadaveric tests using simplified loading configurations have been developed to assess post-THA bone mechanics, although no current studies have demonstrated simplified loading configurations used in mechanical tests may simulate the physiological femoral strains under ADL loads. Using an optimization approach integrated with finite element analysis, this study developed axial compression and combined axial compression and torque testing configurations for three common ADLs (gait, stair-descent and sit-to-stand) via matching the SED profile of the femur in THA-implanted models of three specimens. The optimized simplified-loading models showed good agreement in predicting bone remodeling stimuli (post-THA change in SED per unit mass) and fatigue regions as compared with the ADL-loading models, as well as other modeling and clinical studies.

This study examined adaptation in gait stability and its interlimb transfer in a virtual obstacle avoidance task. Twelve young adults walked on a treadmill while wearing a virtual reality headset with their body state represented in the virtual environment. At random times, but always at foot touchdown, 50 virtual obstacles of constant size appeared 0.8 m in front of the participant requiring a step over with the right leg. Early, mid and late adaptation phases were investigated by pooling data from trials 1-3, 24-26 and 48-50. One left-leg obstacle appearing after 50 right-leg trials was used to investigate interlimb transfer. Toe clearance and the anteroposterior margin of stability (MoS) at foot touchdown were calculated for the stepping leg. Toe clearance decreased over repeated practice between early and late phases from 0.13 ± 0.05 m to 0.09 ± 0.04 m (mean ± SD, p < 0.05). MoS increased from 0.05 ± 0.02 m to 0.08 ± 0.02 m (p < 0.05) between early and late phases, with no significant differences between mid and late phases. No differences were found in toe clearance and MoS between the practiced right leg for early phase and the single trial of the left leg.

With aging, the vitreous undergoes a liquefaction process in which liquid pockets form in the gel network, thereby motivating the detachment of the vitreous from the retina in a process known as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). The PVD process may lead to the formation of floaters and even result in partial or complete loss of vision. Experiments show that the liquefaction and the PVD processes alter the mechanical properties of the vitreous. In this work, we propose a microscopically motivated model that characterizes the changes in the mechanical properties of the vitreous due to aging. To this end, we distinguish between four vitreous states: a homogeneous vitreous, a liquefied vitreous, a vitreous that undergoes partial PVD, and a vitreous with full PVD. The model predicts the time-dependent and the steady-state response of the vitreous in each of the four states. The proposed framework is validated through a comparison with various experimental findings and captures the softening of the vitreous due to aging. We illustrate the importance of the age at which the PVD process begins and of the rate of the detachment process. In addition, we introduce a quantifiable parameter that describes the stage of PVD in the eye. Lastly, we employ our model to investigate the possibility of restoring the mechanical properties of a vitreous that has undergone PVD through the addition of reinforcing fibers to the gel. This work provides insight into the consequences of the age-related changes in the microstructure of the eye and serves as a motivation for new therapeutic measures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigated the influence of ultrasound transducer rotation and tilt on shear wave velocity (SWV, an index of stiffness) measurements of the ITB and the intra-rater repeatability of SWV measurements in the longitudinal direction. SWV was measured unilaterally (dominant limb) using ultrasound shear wave elastography in the middle region of the ITB in supine at rest (20-25° knee flexion) in ten healthy volunteers (4 females). A 3-dimensional video system provided real-time feedback of probe orientation with respect to the thigh. Measurements were made at 10° increments of probe rotation, from longitudinal to transverse alignment relative to the approximate direction of ITB fibres, and 5-10° tilts about the longitudinal and sideways axes of the transducer. One-way repeated measures ANOVA compared SWV between angles and tilts. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to calculate repeatability for two to five (longitudinal only) repetitions. SWV was greatest when the transducer was aligned to ITB fibres (longitudinal: 10.5 ± 1.7 m/s) and lowest when perpendicular (transverse: 5.8 ± 2.4 m/s). Compared to longitudinal alignment, SWV decreased significantly (p < 0.01) when the transducer was rotated 20° or more. Tilted measurements did not differ between angles. Intra-rater repeatability was excellent with the average of two measurements (ICC = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95, 0.99; SEM = 0.31 m/s).

The rapid growth of thrombus at elevated shear rates (~10,000 1/s) relies on shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA) thought to come about from the entanglement of von Willebrand factor (VWF) molecules. The mechanism for SIPA is not yet understood in terms of cell- and molecule-level dynamics in fast flowing bloodstreams. Towards this end, we develop a multiscale computational model to recreate SIPA in silico, where the suspension dynamics and interactions of individual platelets and VWF multimers are resolved directly. The platelet-VWF interaction via GP1b-A1 bonds is prescribed with intrinsic binding rates theoretically derived and informed by single-molecule measurements. The model is validated against existing microfluidic SIPA experiments, showing good agreement with the in vitro observations in terms of the morphology, traveling distance and capture time of the platelet aggregates. Particularly, the capture of aggregates can occur in a few milliseconds, comparable to the platelet transit time through pathologic arterial stenotic sections and much shorter than the time for shear-induced platelet activation. The multiscale SIPA simulator provides a cross-scale tool for exploring the biophysical mechanisms of SIPA in silico that are difficult to access with single-molecule measurements or micro-/macro-fluidic assays only.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The mechanical loads experienced by cells play an important role in cell fate. However, in TE scaffolds with a cell-laden hydrogel matrix, it is prohibitively complex to prescribe and measure this cellular micromechanical environment (CME). Accordingly, this study aimed to develop a finite element (FE) model of a TE scaffold unit cell that can be subsequently implemented to predict the CME and cell fates under prescribed loading. The compressible hyperelastic mechanics of a fibrin hydrogel were characterized by fitting unconfined compression and confined compression experimental data. This material model was implemented in a unit cell FE model of a TE scaffold. The FE mesh and boundary conditions were evaluated with respect to the mechanical response of a region of interest (ROI). A compressible second-order reduced polynomial hyperelastic model gave the best fit to the experimental data (C10 = 1.72 × 10-4, C20 = 3.83 × 10-4, D1 = 3.41, D2 = 8.06 × 10-2). A mesh with seed sizes of 40 µm and 60 µm in the ROI and non-ROI regions, respectively, yielded a converged model in 54 min. The in-plane boundary conditions demonstrated minimal influence on ROI mechanics for a 2-by-2 unit cell. However, the out-of-plane boundary conditions did exhibit an appreciable influence on ROI mechanics for a two bilayer unit cell. Overall, the developed unit cell model facilitates the modeling of the mechanical state of a cell-laden hydrogel within a TE scaffold under prescribed loading.

However, the additional load during jump-landing might increase the potential for overuse injury. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect that barbell load has on lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during jump-landing and to evaluate the effect of arresting the barbell load at flight apex prior to landing on joint kinematic and kinetic variables. Barbell-loaded squat jumps (20, 40, and 60 kg) were investigated during two jump-landing conditions: 1) barbell-loaded (landing with barbell load) and 2) barbell-arrested (barbell load arrested at flight apex prior to jump-landing). Lower body kinematics and joint kinetics were assessed during jump-landing. In the barbell-loaded jump-landing condition, joint angles at initial contact decreased with increasing barbell load. Knee and hip peak power decreased (knee: -38%; hip: -46%), while ankle joint work increased with increasing barbell load. Joint moments, powers and work were decreased in the barbell-arrested condition compared to the barbell-loaded condition. Barbell-loaded jump-landings do not pose increased demands on the knee and the hip joint compared to bodyweight only jump-landings, due to the load-based reductions in jump height and joint kinematic adaptions. However, ankle joint contribution in energy dissipation is increased, possibly resulting in an increased overuse injury risk at this joint. Arresting the barbell load at flight apex prior to jump-landing substantially reduces the joint kinetics, hence serving as valuable training tool for athletes returning to sport after injuries.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, anatomical descriptions indicate fascicles in the quadriceps may have a three-dimensional orientation. The purpose of this investigation was to quantify the maximum force generating capacity of the individual quadriceps' muscles in three dimensions. Muscle architectural parameters were obtained from three cadaver specimens (two female) and input into a geometry-based multiple fascicle muscle force model. Vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris had partitions which could be defined based on differences in the sense and direction of fascicles between partitions. Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris were bipennate due to partitions sharing an aponeurosis. Vastus lateralis deep and superficial partitions exerted posterior- (maximum: -29 ± 5 N) and anterior-directed (maximum: 58 ± 15 N) forces on their shared distal aponeurosis. Rectus femoris medial and lateral partitions exerted medial- (maximum: -38 ± 17 N) and lateral-directed (maximum: 19 ± 12 N) forces on their shared proximal aponeurosis. All vastus medialis fascicles ran along the proximal-distal axis. However, fascicles arising near the lesser trochanter also ran along the superficial-deep axis, while fascicles arising from the linea aspera ran along the medial-lateral axis.

Raman spectroscopy (RS) holds great potential for being a clinical tool with providing quality and quantity measurements of the bone mineralized matrix. Beyond mineral quality and quantity, recent years have revealed newly developed RS-derived bone compositional measurements focusing on organic matrix and water though their associations with bone mechanics have not been fully established yet. Herein, the author reported first thorough characterization study investigating associations between twenty different RS-derived measurements and mechanical properties of human cortical bone (i.e., yield and ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, post-yield toughness, and post-yield strain). Forty-five rectangular human cortical beams harvested from all four anatomical quadrants of two male donors were tested under three-point bending. Raman spectra of each specimen were collected at the spectral range of 800 to 4000 cm-1. While correlations were tested among RS-derived measurements via Spearman's rank correlations, multivariate linear regression using mixed effects were used to determine the best RS-derived measurement or the combination of RS-derived measurements in predicting various mechanical properties of human cortical bone. Most of the RS-derived measurements were associated with the mechanical properties (Rm2 ranges from 8.9 to 68.3%, p < 0.05). The various linear combinations of six RS-derived measurements focusing on different aspects of bone matrix (i.e., ν1PO4/Amide I, ν1PO4/Amide III, Carbonate/ν1PO4, ~I1670/I1640, ~I3453/I2949, ~I3584/I2949) improved the prediction (Rm2 = 43.5 to 70.2%, p < 0.05). While a causal relationship still needs to be investigated, RS has a great potential to establish a robust patient-specific fracture risk prediction with the latest advances in technologies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To further our understanding of how a skier's position affects the air flow and the resulting aerodynamic drag, a combination of both experimental and simulation methods was used. This study focused in particular on the effect of skier torso and thigh angles relative to the air flow direction, as these two angles have been previously found to be important determinants of aerodynamic performance in tucked positions. Two top 30 world-ranked skiers were investigated in two different wind tunnels, and the results were compared with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations performed using a 3D scan of one of the athlete. To quantify the effect of torso and thigh angles on skier drag, changes in drag were measured relative to baseline positions. Skier drag area increased by approximately 0.8 and 1.2% per degree increase in torso and thigh angles relative to the baseline position, respectively. This trend was consistent between both of the experimental wind tunnel tests as well as the CFD simulations, indicating good agreement between methods. The CFD simulations further indicated that the air flow about the lower legs made the largest contribution to skier drag, accounting for as much as 40-50% of the total drag area in low tuck positions. Based on these findings, a low tuck position where the torso angle approaches 0° and the knees help to fill the gap behind the armpits will minimize skier aerodynamic drag.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, little is known about how implant design parameters affect active knee kinematics. Comprehensive in silico and in vitro sensitivity analyses were performed, based on one patient-specific, physical knee implant set and corresponding bone and knee implant surface geometry data. The implant surfaces were parametrized and varied systematically, resulting in 85 different knee implant surface models. In addition, four variations of extensor mechanism parameters, being the muscular attachment points defining the Q-Angle, were investigated. The variations were evaluated in a patient-specific multibody simulation model and an experimental testing rig and contributions of different implant designs and extensor mechanism parameters on kinematics were analysed. The results of the in silico and in vitro analyses showed good qualitative agreement. The highest deviations from the implant's reference kinematics were found for parameter variations of the femoral sagittal radii, the lateral trochlear elevation, the tibial sagittal slopes, the mediolateral position of the patellar ridge and the mediolateral position of the tuberositas tibiae. The implant design parameters identified with the highest functional relevance should be focused on in implant design. As the tuberositas tibiae's position constituted a main impact factor, it should also be considered during implant design and preoperative planning.

Nanoparticles have provided an attractive approach for this purpose. In practice, the major focus of targeted delivery has been on targeting cell receptors. However, the complex fluid mechanics in diseased biomedical flows questions if a sufficient number of nanoparticles can reach the desired region. In this paper, we propose that hidden topological structures in cardiovascular flows identified with Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) control drug transport and provide valuable information for optimizing targeted drug delivery efficiency. We couple image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with continuum transport models to study nanoparticle transport in coronary artery disease. We simulate nanoparticle transport as well as the recently proposed shear targeted drug delivery system that couples micro-carriers with nanoparticle drugs.

To understand how nuclear deformation regulates cellular behaviors, the details of intranuclear strain distribution caused by mechanical stimuli as well as intranuclear mechanical properties are required. Here, we examine local mechanical strains within the nucleus in a living cell subjected to substrate stretching and estimate the local nuclear mechanical properties. A HeLa cell in a PDMS chamber was subjected to a 10% step-strain by using a custom-made uni-axial stretching device. Local displacements and the distribution of the equivalent strain within the nucleus were obtained from fluorescence images of the nucleus before and after the application of stretching. The intranuclear strain showed heterogeneous distribution, and higher strain regions were observed not only at the center, but also periphery of the nucleus. We examined the role of the chromatin condensation level and actin cytoskeleton by treating cells with Trichostatin A and Cytochalasin D, respectively. Interestingly, these treatments did not cause significant changes in the intranuclear strain distribution. Referring to the experimental results, we reproduced the nuclear strain distribution in a finite element model to estimate relative distribution of Young's modulus within the nucleus, and observed substantially lower Young's modulus levels in the peripheral regions of the nucleus relative to those found in the central regions of the nucleus.

How people do this is not well understood. We recently developed computational models of lateral stepping, based on Goal Equivalent Manifolds that serve as motor regulation templates, to identify how people regulate walking movements from step-to-step. In normal walking, healthy adults strongly maintain step width, but also lateral position on their path. Here, we used this framework to pose empirically-testable hypotheses about how humans might adapt their lateral stepping dynamics when asked to prioritize different stepping goals. Participants walked on a treadmill in a virtual-reality environment under 4 conditions: normal walking and, while given direct feedback at each step, walking while trying to maintain constant step width, constant absolute lateral position, or constant heading (direction). Time series of lateral stepping variables were extracted, and variability and statistical persistence (reflecting step-to-step regulation) quantified. Participants exhibited less variability of the prescribed stepping variable compared to normal walking during each feedback condition. Stepping regulation results supported our models' predictions: to maintain constant step width or position, people either maintained or increased regulation of the prescribed variable, but also decreased regulation of its complement. Thus, people regulated lateral foot placements in predictable and systematic ways determined by specific task goals. Humans regulate stepping movements to not only ""just walk"" (step without falling), but also to achieve specific goal-directed tasks within a specific environment. The framework and motor regulation templates presented here capture these important interactions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether two common contact models (Hunt-Crossley and Elastic Foundation) can accurately represent the fingerpad. Two musculoskeletal models of the index finger were created by adding fingerpad contact geometry using either the Hunt-Crossley or Elastic Foundation contact models. Key contact parameters (target force, contact area, and stiffness) were then systematically varied through 432 forward dynamic simulations to examine how these parameters influenced estimation of finger-tip forces. Across all simulations, variation in target force, contact area, and stiffness parameters impacted the computation time required to complete the simulations and the accuracy of the predicted finger-tip force. Computation time was over three times longer in simulations with high versus low values of contact area and stiffness in both contact models. For both contact models, larger contact area and stiffness values resulted in simulations that more closely predicted target force. However, across all simulations, the Hunt-Crossley model produced a greater proportion of accurate finger-tip force simulations than the Elastic Foundation model, suggesting that the Hunt-Crossley contact model may be preferable for modeling the fingerpad. Overall, our study demonstrates how the Hunt-Crossley and Elastic Foundation contact models behave in low-force biomechanical scenarios, such as those experienced during hand-object manipulation, and provides a foundation for incorporating contact mechanics into musculoskeletal models of the hand.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recently, the LESI (local extensional stiffness identification) methodology has been established to quantify non-invasively local stiffness properties of ATAAs using electrocardiographic-gated computed tomography (ECG-gated CT) scans. The aim of the current study was to determine the most sensitive markers of local ATAA stiffness estimation with the hypothesis that direct measures of local ATAA stiffness could better detect the high-risk patients. A cohort of 30 patients (12 BAV and 18 TAV) referred for aortic size evaluation by ECG-gated CT were recruited. For each patient, the extensional stiffness Q was evaluated by the LESI methodology whilst computational flow analyses were also performed to derive hemodynamics markers such as the wall shear stress (WSS). A strong positive correlation was found between the extensional stiffness and the aortic pulse pressure (R = 0.644 and p < 0.001). Interestingly, a significant positive correlation was also found between the extensional stiffness and patients age for BAV ATAAs (R = 0.619 and p = 0.032), but not for TAV ATAAs (R = -0.117 and p = 0.645). No significant correlation was found between the extensional stiffness and WSS evaluated locally.

Currently, it is not known how sensitive time-continuous analyses are to timing variability that occur in gait data. We evaluated this sensitivity by examining the frequency of significant SPM outcomes between two walking speeds when lower limb kinematics and kinetics were segmented and aligned based on 40 repeatable gait events. These events, defined in the supplementary material, include a commonly used event like foot contact and other events that have been previously demonstrated to be repeatable. Repeatable gait events were determined from joint and segment kinematics, joint kinetics as well as ground reaction forces. We examined the frequency of statistical outcomes for a single subject with different numbers of strides analyzed and for a cohort of 10 subjects. Our findings demonstrate that gait interventions, such as changes in walking speed, can induce temporal shifts that affect time-continuous outcomes for both cohort- and subject-level analyses. As both timing and magnitude are important in gait data, researchers are encouraged to perform additional analyses to understand how both of these variables affect time-continuous analysis outcomes. Finally, we demonstrate that multiple SPM tests can be performed to determine if statistical outcomes are due to temporal shifting or differences in magnitude. It is important to understand how both timing and magnitude of biomechanical data influences time continuous analyses as these analyses inform injury prevention, device development and basic understanding of biomechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

There was adventitial thickening in the small-sized mesenteric artery, but also significant changes in elastic lamellar structure and contractility. An increased contractile response to phenylephrine coupled with a reduced vasodilatory response to acetylcholine in the mesenteric artery suggested an increased contractile state in response to hypertension.

To aid in this innovation, this study presents the current understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the LLC through a systematic review. Three medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Embase) were searched from inception through July 2019. Original studies investigating the anatomy and/or biomechanical properties of the LLC were considered for inclusion. Data recorded from each study included: number of cadavers, number of feet, gender, laterality, age, type of specimen, measurement methods, reported ligamentous bundles, ligament origins and insertions, geometric characteristics, and biomechanical properties of the LLC. The Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies (QUACS) scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of included articles.

High efficiency and a range of angles and torques are characteristics of human hopping at different frequencies. Humans use muscles in combination with tendons to achieve the required joint actuation. Therefore, we consider whether appropriately tuned series elastic actuators (SEAs) placed at the leg joints can be used to reduce the functional gap between robots and humans. Human hip, knee, and ankle biomechanics were recorded over a range of hopping frequencies to extract joint angles and torques, which were used as an input to a mechanical simulation SEA model. This model was used to optimize the SEA stiffness of each joint to either minimize peak power or energy requirements. This work investigated the relationship between hopping frequency and SEA stiffness, the utility of using SEAs at each joint, and the reasons behind humans' preferred hopping frequency. Although the constant stiffness values across different hopping frequencies are suitable for the knee and the ankle, a variable serial elastic actuator stiffness could still further reduce energy requirements. Optimal SEA stiffness was found to reduce peak power requirements by up to 73% at the ankle and up to 66% at the knee, with greatest benefits found around the preferred frequency. However, no SEA benefits were found for the hip and above the preferred hopping frequency for the knee.

Assessment of both the translational and rotational kinematics in the sagittal-plane requires understanding the critical relationship between the direction and location of F. Prior work demonstrated that band-pass filtered F direction and center-of-pressure (CoP) covary in time such that the F vector lines-of-action pass near a fixed point called an intersection point (IP). The height of that IP (IPz) varies systematically with the frequency of the pass band. From F measurements in able-bodied humans (n = 17) standing on various pitched surfaces, the present study also found the emergent property of an IP, with IPz located above the center of mass (CoM) at frequencies <1.75 Hz and below the CoM for higher frequencies. This property aids in maintaining upright posture for various perturbation modes within a single control structure. From purely mechanical effects, standing on a pitched surface should not change IPz, however these measurements of F show that IPz is generally closer to CoM height. This characterization of quiet standing provides simple means of assessing the complex multi-joint coordination of standing and relates directly to the physical demands of controlling the translational and rotational aspects of body posture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to quantify the repeatability of vBMD and femoral neck strength obtained from 3D-DXA images and determine the changes due an exercise intervention. The DXA scans included pairs of same-day repeated scans from ten healthy females and pre- and post-exercise intervention scans of 26 males. FE models with element-by-element correspondence were generated by morphing a template mesh to each bone. BMD and femoral strength under single-leg-stance and sideways fall loading configurations were obtained for both groups and compared. In the repeated images, the total hip vBMD difference was 0.5 ± 2.5%. Element-by-element BMD differences reached 30 ± 50%. The strength difference in single-leg stance was 2.8 ± 13% and in sideways fall was 4.5% ± 19%. In the exercise group, strength changes were 6 ± 19% under single-leg stance and 1 ± 18% under sideways fall. vBMD parameters were weakly correlated to strength (R2 < 0.31). The exercise group had a mean bone accrual exceeding repeatability values in the femoral head and cortical regions. The case with the highest vBMD change (6.4%) caused 18% and -7% strength changes under single-leg stance and sideways fall. 3D-DXA technology can assess the effect of exercise interventions in large cohorts but its validity in individual cases should be interpreted with caution.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

CAVD is thought to be driven by the persistent activation of the predominant cell type in the valve, aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), into myofibroblasts, resulting in subsequent calcification and stenosis of the valve. Although much of the research into CAVD focuses on AVICs, the aortic valve endothelial cells (AVECs) have been shown to regulate AVICs and maintain tissue homeostasis. Exposed to distinct flow patterns during the cardiac cycle, the AVECs lining either side of the valve demonstrate crucial differences which could contribute to the preferential formation of calcific nodules on the aorta-facing (fibrosa) side of the valve. Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is a cell-cell adhesion protein which has been previously associated with AVIC myofibroblast activation, nodule formation, and CAVD in mice. In this study, we investigated the role of CDH11 in AVECs and examined side-specific differences. The aorta-facing or fibrosa endothelial cells (fibAVECs) express higher levels of CDH11 than the ventricle-facing or ventricularis endothelial cells (venAVECs). This increase in expression corresponds with increased contraction of a free-floating collagen gel compared to venAVECs. Additionally, co-culture of fibAVECs with AVICs demonstrated decreased contraction compared to an AVIC + AVIC control, but increased contraction compared to the venAVECs co-culture. This aligns with the known preferential formation of calcific nodules on the fibrosa. These results together indicate a potential role for CDH11 expression by AVECs in regulating AVIC contraction and subsequent calcification.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Analyses were performed on 5 controls and 5 patients with cardiac light-chain amyloidosis. In Model II, viscosity ranged between 3.0 (-19%) and 4.3 cP (+16%), mildly deviating from the standard value. In the non-Newtonian model, this effect was emphasized: viscosity ranged from 3.2 to 6.0 cP, deviating maximally from the standard value in low shear rate (i.e., <100 s-1) regions. This effect reflected on EL quantifications: in particular, as compared to Model I, Model III yielded markedly higher EL values (up to +40%) or markedly lower (down to -21%) for subjects with hematocrit higher than 39.5% and lower than 30%, respectively. Accounting for non-Newtonian blood behavior on a patient-specific basis may enhance the accuracy of intracardiac energetics assessment by 4D Flow, which may be explored as non-invasive index to discriminate between healthy and pathologic LV.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

They also generally neglect the realistic structure of the joints with disc nuclei/annuli, facets, and ligaments. We aim to develop a novel MS model where trunk muscles are incorporated into a detailed finite element (FE) model of the ligamentous T12-S1 spine thus constructing a gold standard coupled MS-FE model. Model predictions are compared under some tasks with those of our earlier spherical joints, beam joints, and hybrid (uncoupled) MS-FE models. The coupled model predicted L4-L5 intradiscal pressures (R2 ≅ 0.97, RMSE ≅ 0.27 MPa) and L1-S1 centers of rotation (CoRs) in agreement to in vivo data. Differences in model predictions grew at larger trunk flexion angles; at the peak (80°) flexion the coupled model predicted, compared to the hybrid model, much smaller global/local muscle forces (~38%), segmental (~44%) and disc (~22%) compression forces but larger segmental (~9%) and disc (~17%) shear loads, ligament forces at the lower lumbar levels (by up to 57%) and facet forces at all levels. The spherical/beam joints models predicted much greater muscle forces and segmental loads under larger flexion angles. Unlike the spherical joints model with fixed CoRs, the beam joints model predicted CoRs closer (RMSE = 2.3 mm in flexion tasks) to those of the coupled model. The coupled model offers a great potential for future studies towards improvement of surgical techniques, management of musculoskeletal injuries and subject-specific simulations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A limited number of studies exist in the literature reporting kinematic abnormalities in children with Achondroplasia. Reported deviations include increased pelvic tilt, flexed knees during stance and excessive hip abduction. However, studies lack full 3-dimensional data and results are variable. The aim of this study was to examine differences in 3-dimensional kinematics during gait between children with Achondroplasia and age-matched controls A retrospective analysis was conducted of our gait laboratory database over a 20-year period. Eight children with Achondroplasia and 32 children with typical development were included. A full 3-dimensional kinematic analysis was performed using a CODA mpx30/cx1 active marker system. Increased flexion at all joints in the sagittal plane, increased hip abduction and foot supination in the coronal plane and increased external hip rotation were present for children with Achondroplasia. In contrast to other studies, increased knee varus was not an issue for the children in this study.

The method induces a relationship of both with one another. As to our knowledge, there has been no investigation into their relation so far. To show empirically what effects may be of importance, we use SPM with linear time interpolation (LI) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) separately for data of a study on stair ascent kinematics between two groups. There is a slight difference in statistical significance for the comparison of LI and DTW. LI-uniquely significant time highlight differences due to in-group time-variations, whereas DTW-uniqueness is tied to qualitative differences of homogeneous events. The comparison of stair ascent kinematics with DTW shows more pronounced evidence for backlift-like strategies for the older group, although trunk angles are kept more extended as to ensure stabilty. Thus, the difference in SPM from TN is slight but important, if there is need to mirror said effects methodically.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Conventional laboratory pumps typically lack the ability to deliver cell culture media at the low flow rates required to meet the physiological ranges of fluid flow, and are often pulsatile or require flow reversal. Here, a microfluidic-based pump is presented, which allows for the controlled delivery of media for vascular microphysiological applications. The performance of the pump was characterized in a range of microfluidic systems, including straight channels of varying dimensions and self-assembled microvascular networks. A theoretical framework was developed based on lumped element analysis to predict the performance of the pump for different fluidic configurations and a finite element model of the included check-valves.

Wall shear stress (WSS), exerted by blood flow on the endothelium surface, is a crucial factor in the circulatory system. WSS affects the adhesion and preferential accumulation of drug carriers. Here, we propose, an innovative approach to investigate particle adhesion in a converging artery-sized model, lined with human endothelial cells. Unlike widely used microfluidic and in vivo setups, our model enables to investigate particle accumulation in a continuous WSS range, performed in a single experiment, and at the right scale relevant for human arteries. First, we characterized the flow and the WSS map along the designed model, which can span along the entire arterial WSS range. We then used the model to examine the effect of particle size and the suspension buffer on particle adhesion distribution. The results demonstrated the role of particle size, where the same particles with a diameter of 2 µm exhibit shear-decreased adhesion while 500 nm particles exhibit shear-enhanced adhesion. Furthermore, under the same WSS, particles show a similar behavior when suspended in a Dextran buffer, having a viscosity analogous to blood, compared to a phosphate buffer solution without Dextran. Moreover, experiments with RBCs in the phosphate buffer, at a 40% physiological hematocrit, decreased particle adhesion and affected their deposition pattern.

The ability to non-invasively monitor changes in skin microcirculation improves both the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases. In this study, we propose a novel technique for evaluating the palms' blood distribution following arteriovenous access, based on thermal imaging. Furthermore, we utilize the thermal images to identify typical recovery patterns of patients that underwent this surgery and show that thermal images taken post-surgery reflect the patient's follow-up status. Thermal photographs were taken by a portable thermal camera from both hands before and after the A-V access surgery, and one month following the surgery, from ten dialysis patients. A novel term ""Thermo-Anatomical Segmentation"", which enables a functional assessment of palm blood distribution was defined. Based on this segmentation it was shown that the greatest change after surgery was in the most distal region, the fingertips (p < 0.05). In addition, the changes in palm blood distribution in both hands were synchronized, which indicates a bilateral effect. An unsupervised machine learning model revealed two variables that determine the recovery pattern following the surgery: the palms' temperature difference pre- and post-surgery and the post-surgery difference between the treated and untreated hand. Our proposed framework provides a new technique for quantitative assessment of the palm's blood distribution. This technique may improve the clinical treatment of patients with vascular disease, particularly the patient-specific follow-up, in clinics as well as in homecare.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty 3D strain fields, estimated from tagged MRI image volumes in 19 adult subjects, were analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). These strain fields represented dynamic, 3D brain deformations during constrained head accelerations, either involving rotation about the vertical axis of the neck or neck extension. DMD results reveal fundamental oscillatory modes of deformation at damped frequencies near 7 Hz (in neck rotation) and 11 Hz (in neck extension).

In this study, we aimed to investigate effective trunk positions for stretching of the LD. A total of 14 healthy males participated in this study. The following seven trunk positions were chosen as the LD stretching positions; upright of the trunk (Baseline), flexion of the trunk (Flex), contralateral bending of the trunk (LB), contralateral rotation of the trunk (Rot), flexion and contralateral bending of the trunk (Flex + LB), flexion and contralateral rotation of the trunk (Flex + Rot), and contralateral bending and contralateral rotation of the trunk (LB + Rot). Maximal elevation of the upper limb was passively added to all positions. The shear elastic modulus, used as the index of muscle elongation, was measured at the four parts (upper, middle, lower, distal parts) of the LD. The shear elastic moduli showed obviously high values in Rot and LB + Rot at the upper, middle, and distal parts, and also in LB, Rot, and LB + Rot at the lower part. These findings suggest that contralateral trunk rotation, or a combination of contralateral trunk bending and rotation are effective trunk positions for stretching all parts of the LD.

This study aimed to investigate the kinematics and kinetics of the MFJC and ankle during the propulsive phase of walking in subjects with larger and smaller midfoot passive stiffness. MFJC passive stiffness of 20 healthy adult participants, and the kinematics and kinetics of the MFJC (forefoot-rearfoot) and ankle (rearfoot-shank) during the stance phase of walking were measured. The participants were divided equally into two groups according to the MFJC passive stiffness. Ranges of motion (ROM) and mean joint moments were computed for the late stance. Independent t-tests (α = 0.05) revealed that subjects with lower midfoot passive stiffness showed an increased MFJC sagittal ROM (flattened longitudinal arch) (p = 0.002), increased ankle frontal ROM (more everted positions) (p = 0.002), increased MFJC frontal ROM (more inverted positions) (p = 0.019), as well as a tendency for larger ankle sagittal ROM (p = 0.056). They also showed increased MFJC (p = 0.021) and ankle (p = 0.018) moments in the sagittal plane, increased MFJC moment in the frontal plane (p = 0.047) and a tendency for a predominant ankle moment in the frontal (p = 0.058).

Despite their growing use, little is known about the effects of varying low-pass filter cutoff frequency, which can affect the magnitude of force-related dependent variables, the accuracy of IMU-derived metrics, or if simpler methods for such estimations exist. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying low-pass filter cutoff frequency on the correlation of IMU-derived peak GRFv and tc to gold-standard lab-based measurements. Thirty National Collegiate Athletics Association Division 1 cross country runners ran on an instrumented treadmill at a range of speeds while outfitted with a sacral-mounted IMU. A simple method for estimating peak GRFv from the IMU was implemented by multiplying the IMU's vertical acceleration by the runner's body mass. Data from the IMU were low-pass filtered with 5, 10, and 30 Hz cutoffs. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine how well the IMU-derived estimates matched gold-standard biomechanical estimations. Correlations ranged from very weak to moderate for peak GRFv and tc. For peak GRFv, the 10 Hz low-pass filter cutoff performed best (r = 0.638), while for tc the 5 Hz cut-off performed best (r = 0.656). These results suggest that IMU-derived estimates of force and contact time are influenced by the low-pass filter cutoff frequency.

The ventricular pressure-volume loop displays the instantaneous relationship between intraventricular pressure and volume throughout the cardiac cycle; however, it does not consider the shape of the ventricles, their spatiotemporal deformation patterns, and how these balance with the flowing blood. Our study demonstrates that the pressure-volume relationship represents a first level of approximation for the mechanical power of the ventricles, while, at a further level of approximation, the importance of hemodynamic power emerges through the balance between deformation patterns and fluid dynamics. The analysis is preliminarily tested in a healthy subject's right ventricle and two patients. Moreover, patients' geometry was then rescaled to present a normal volumetric profile to verify whether results were affected by volume size or by the spatiotemporal pattern of how that volume profile was achieved. Results show that alterations of hemodynamic power were found in the abnormal ventricles and that they were not directly caused by the ventricular size but by changes in the ability of intraventricular pressure gradient to generate blood flow. Therefore, hemodynamic power represents a physics-based measure that takes into account the dynamics of the space-time shape changes in combination with blood flow. Hemodynamic power is assessed non-invasively using cardiac imaging techniques and can be an early indicator of cardiac dysfunction before changes occur in volumetric measurements.

Physically active adults with flexible (n = 16) and stiff (n = 16) MLA completed DVJs onto a force platform from a height of 30 cm. Eccentric and concentric subphases of the DVJ were identified from the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) data. Jump height, ground contact time, reactive strength index (RSI), vertical center-of-mass depth, vertical stiffness and time of the eccentric and concentric subphases were evaluated. Amortization force, peak vertical GRF and vertical impulse were also obtained for the eccentric and concentric subphases of the DVJ.

Objective metrics to assess knee joint instability are lacking, making it difficult to target therapies aiming to improve stability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare responses in neuromechanics to perturbations during gait in patients with self-reported knee joint instability (KOA-I) versus patients reporting stable knees (KOA-S) and healthy control subjects. Forty patients (20 KOA-I and 20 KOA-S) and 20 healthy controls were measured during perturbed treadmill walking. Knee joint angles and muscle activation patterns were compared using statistical parametric mapping and discrete gait parameters. Furthermore, subgroups (moderate versus severe KOA) based on Kellgren and Lawrence classification were evaluated. Patients with KOA-I generally had greater knee flexion angles compared to controls during terminal stance and during swing of perturbed gait. In response to deceleration perturbations the patients with moderate KOA-I increased their knee flexion angles during terminal stance and pre-swing. Knee muscle activation patterns were overall similar between the groups. In response to sway medial perturbations the patients with severe KOA-I increased the co-contraction of the quadriceps versus hamstrings muscles during terminal stance. Patients with KOA-I respond to different gait perturbations by increasing knee flexion angles, co-contraction of muscles or both during terminal stance. These alterations in neuromechanics could assist in the assessment of knee joint instability in patients, to provide treatment options accordingly.

Leaflet laceration (BASILICA technique) has been proposed to prevent CAO and to potentially reduce the risk of leaflet thrombosis. We have previously demonstrated that this technique can reduce the anchorage forces of the TAVR device, which may lead to future complications. In this short communication, we hypothesize that the anchorage force reduction can be minimized by implanting a TAVR with a larger diameter, if two sizes are clinically recommended. We evaluated this hypothesis by employing finite element models of the deployments of the Evolut 26 and 29 mm inside a 27 mm Mitroflow valve, with and without leaflet lacerations. The results show that a laceration substantially decreases the contact area between the Evolut stent and the Mitroflow valve. The larger Evolut has a larger contact area and stronger anchorage forces. Additionally, the anchorage forces are less sensitive to additional lacerations in the larger Evolut (29 case). The results suggest that a larger self-expending device can ensure stronger anchorage and can lower the risk of possible migration, when TAVR is performed in a lacerated bioprosthesis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The plantarflexion angle of the giving-way trial was larger than the control trials from the point of initial contact until the end of the trial. Inversion was also 27-degrees greater 150 ms after initial contact in the giving-way trial and 26-degrees greater compared to control trials 1 and 2. Substantially greater plantarflexion, inversion and internal rotation angles of the ankle were observed during the giving-way trial compared to control trials. The maximum vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces, as well as ankle inversion and internal rotation moments, were lower for the giving-way trial in comparison to the control trials.

It is well known that while crossing obstacles, variables quantifying the gait pattern are controlled relative to the obstacle's position. However, the stability of these gait variables is underexplored. We measured foot positions relative to an obstacle as young and older adults stepped over it. We report secondary analysis of this data in which we quantified the stability of the step length when the two feet are placed on either side of the obstacle. We employed the uncontrolled manifold approach to test the hypotheses that (1) synergistic across-trial co-variation in the distances of the front and the back heel from the obstacle edge will stabilize the step length, and (2) older adults will display weaker synergies (i.e., lower step length stability). We observed that the front and back heel distances relative to the obstacle's edge co-varied synergistically to stabilize the step length for both age groups. Therefore, foot placement during obstacle navigation is controlled not only with reference to a feature of the environment (i.e. the obstacle), but also to stabilize the step length, presumably to control COM motion. The synergy index was 38% lower for older adults than young adults.

Blood flow stagnation and prolonged residence times in the neo-sinuses have been suggested as possible explanations for leaflet thrombosis. The BASILICA technique, which was originally developed to treat coronary flow obstruction, has also been proposed as an alternative to reduce the risk of thrombus formation. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of BASILICA on the valve-in-valve thrombogenicity using computational fluid dynamics simulations. To this end, two Eulerian and two Lagrangian approaches were employed to estimate near-wall stagnation measures in eight valve-in-valve models. The models included an intact or lacerated Sorin Mitroflow surgical valve, and either a SAPIEN or Evolut transcatheter aortic valve device. The Lagrangian approaches predicted a high number of particles and vortices concentration in the proximal areas of the neo-sinuses, while the Eulerian approaches did so in the distal areas. As a consequence, this study demonstrated that Lagrangian approaches are better predictors of subclinical leaflet thrombosis, since they match experimental and clinical findings. Additionally, the SAPIEN valve possess a higher risk for developing leaflet thrombosis, and two lacerations are shown to provide the best results in terms of development of vortices and accumulation of particles within the neo-sinuses.

To address this limitation, we added two spatial proximity functions to an existing mechanoregulatory model of fracture healing to control the localization of callus within the healing domain. We tested the performance of the new model in an idealized ovine tibial osteotomy with medial plate fixation using three sizes of healing domains and multiple variations of the spatial proximity functions. All model variations produced outward callus growth and bridging weighted toward the far cortex, which is consistent with in vivo healing. With and without the proximity functions, there were marked differences in the predicted callus volume and shape. With no proximity functions, the callus produced was strongly domain dependent, with a 15% difference in volume between the smallest and largest initialization domains. With proximity function control, callus growth was restricted to near the fracture line and there was only 2% difference in volume between domain sizes. Superimposing both proximity functions - one to control outward growth and one representing a decay in periosteal activity away from the fracture - produced a predicted callus size that was within the physiologic range for sheep and had a realistic morphology when compared with fluorescent dye co-localization with calcium deposition over time and histology.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To enhance the biomechanical performance of porous tissue scaffolds, computational design techniques have gained growing popularity attributable to their compelling efficiency and strong predictive features compared with time-consuming trial-and-error experiments. Nevertheless, the mechanical stimulus necessary for bone regeneration, which characterizes dynamic nature due to continuous variation in the bone-scaffold construct system as a result of bone-ingrowth and scaffold biodegradation, is often neglected. Thus, this study proposes a time-dependent mechanobiology-based topology optimization framework for design of tissue scaffolds, thereby developing an ongoing favorable microenvironment and ensuring a long-term outcome for bone regeneration. For the first time, a level-set based topology optimization algorithm and a time-dependent shape derivative are developed to optimize the scaffold architecture. In this study, a large bone defect in a simulated 2D femur model and a partial defect in a 3D femur model are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. The results are compared with those obtained from stiffness-based topology optimization, time-independent design and typical scaffold constructs, showing significant advantages in continuing bone ingrowth outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The electronic universal testing machine was used to test the mechanical properties of shearing and bending. The microstructure of the stalk of Glycyrrhiza glabra was observed with a microscope. Mechanical test research indicated that the shearing process included an elastic phase, a yield phase, and a plastic deformation phase. The bending process was divided into elastic deformation stage and plastic deformation stage. In addition, the shearing force, shearing energy, bending force and bending energy all increased with the increase in diameter. As the water content increased, the shearing force and bending force decreased at first, reached the minimum when the water content was about 45%, and then had an upward trend. The shearing energy increased with the water content, and the bending energy, decreased with the water content. The two test factors were statistically significant for both shearing and bending properties. The microscopic test results showed that the phloem, fiber, and pith constitute the microstructure of the licorice stalk. The linear regression model could reflect the correlation between the cross-sectional area of each part and the shearing force and bending force (P < 0.05). Through analysis, it was concluded that the change of the cross-sectional area of the stalk microstructure had an important influence on the mechanical properties of shearing and bending. The results can provide theoretical basis for the design of Glycyrrhiza Glabra stalk harvesting, crushing and processing equipment.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To better understand the operation of human-stomach, the process of mixing and emptying of gastric contents is simulated using a numerical method. The numerical results confirm that a fast pathway is located close to the lesser curvature of the stomach when water is emptied. However, this fast pathway doesn't exist when the gastric contents are composed of water and food boluses with different properties. The muscle contractions enhance the mixing of light food boluses and water, while they have limited effects on heavy food boluses. As a result, the foods are distributed in layers; heavy food boluses are located in the bottom layer. Besides the gastric motility and high viscosity of foods, the food matrix made of heavy food particles is also important to the formation of the Magenstrasse (stomach road). The food matrix and the zone of wrinkles behave like a porous medium which has higher flow resistance to the light food particles than to the water, leading to faster emptying of water. The water is emptied along the stomach wall since the flow resistance in the stomach wrinkles is smaller than the one in the food matrix. This mechanism is supported by the numerical results, while it might interpret the phenomena observed in the experiments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Standardisation of kinematic approaches is important; however, the method that is currently recommended for building the joint coordinate system (JCS) to measure kinematics of the wrist is difficult to implement in vivo. In this study, a series of JCSs were examined and compared to the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) recommendations in terms of landmark digitisation repeatability, coordinate frame creation repeatability, and secondary rotations during planar motion. No differences were found between the ISB JCS and 338 of 408 of the JCSs proposed in the study, meaning that the proposed alternative can be used without affecting the measured joint angles or repeatability of the JCS. Forearm frames that used a vector between the epicondyles to define the YZ plane of the forearm were found to create JCSs that produced secondary rotations greater than that which would be clinically detectable and thus, they should be avoided when defining a JCS. The remaining 338 coordinate systems can be used interchangeably; consequently, should there be any clinical limitations that result in missing landmarks, alternative coordinate systems can be used. A joint coordinate system created using the radial styloid, ulnar styloid, medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle, the heads of the second and fifth metacarpal, and the base of the third metacarpal is recommended for quantifying kinematics in vivo.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Methodology: Fifteen pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric femoral heads were randomized to three sets of five pairs each for center-center implantation of either TFNA blade, TFNA screw, or PFNA blade. By splitting the specimens of each pair for treatment with or without bone cement augmentation, six study groups were created. All specimens were biomechanically tested under progressively increasing cyclic loading featuring a physiologic loading trajectory in a setup simulating a reduced intertrochanteric fracture with lack of posteromedial support. Number of cycles to 5° varus collapse was evaluated together with the corresponding load at failure. Results: Compared to the non-augmented state, all types of implants demonstrated significantly higher numbers of cycles to failure and load at failure following augmentation, p ≤ 0.03. Augmented TFNA blades resulted in highest numbers of cycles to failure and loads at failure (30492; 4049 N) followed by augmented PFNA blades (30033; 4003 N) and augmented TFNA screws (19307; 2930 N), p = 0.11. Augmented TFNA screws showed similar numbers of cycles to failure and loads at failure compared to both non-augmented TFNA and PFNA blades, P = 0.98. From a biomechanical perspective, bone cement augmentation significantly increases the cut-out resistance of instrumented TFNA and PFNA head elements and is a valid supplementary treatment option to these nailing procedures in poor bone quality.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This paper investigates, combines, and compares the kinematic features from linear and nonlinear walking trajectories to design supervised machine learning models which differentiate asymptomatic individuals from those with CNP. For this, 126 features were extracted from seven body segments of 20 asymptomatic subjects and 20 individuals with non-specific CNP. Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) was used to identify body segments and the corresponding significant features which have the maximum discriminative power for conducting classification. We assessed the efficacy of NCA combined with K- Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis. By applying NCA, all classifiers increased their performance for both linear and nonlinear walking trajectories. Notably, features selected by NCA which magnify the classification power of the computational model were solely from the head, trunk and pelvis kinematics. Our results revealed that the nonlinear trajectory provides the best classification performance through the NCA-K-NN algorithms with an accuracy of 90%, specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 83.3%. The selected features by NCA are introduced as key biomarkers of gait kinematics for classifying non-specific CNP. This paper provides insight into changes in gait kinematics which are present in people with non-specific CNP which can be exploited for classification purposes. The result highlights the importance of curvilinear gait kinematic features which potentially could be utilized in future research to predict recurrent episodes of neck pain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study performed an in vitro experiment using the microfluidic channel with two reservoirs to investigate the effect of fluid flow on the swimming properties of the bovine sperm. The width and height of the manufactured channel were 200 and 20 μm, respectively. The flow in the microchannel occurs because of the hydraulic head difference between the two reservoirs. Sperm with positive rheotaxis proceed in the opposite direction of the flow in the channel after swimming up the downstream reservoir. This study focused on the effect of the flow in the microfluidic channel on sperm motility. It was observed that sperm mostly moved along the channel wall and accumulated near the wall away from the downstream reservoir. The existence of fluid flow in the channel brought about an increase in the ratio of the sperm with positive rheotaxis. Furthermore, the experimental results indicated that the motility of sperm swimming against the flow along the wall increased away from the downstream reservoir. These results will provide useful information to understand the mechanism of sperm navigation for in vivo fertilization.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This is a critical biomechanical issue for astronauts as they may be more prone to bone fractures. To combat this issue, lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is a concept that generates artificial gravitational forces that may help strengthen bones and muscles during long-term spaceflight. Negative pressure, defined as below ambient pressure, is applied within a chamber that encompasses the lower half of the body. By increasing the negative pressure, more ground reaction forces (GRFs) are generated beneath the subject's feet. We hypothesize that increasing the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the subject's waist will generate greater GRFs beneath the subject's feet. Six healthy subjects volunteered to participate under two different experimental conditions: 1) original CSA of their waist and 2) larger CSA of their waist. In both conditions the subjects were suspended in a supine position (simulated microgravity) along with a weight scale beneath their feet. Negative pressures ranged from zero to 50 mmHg, increasing in increments of 5 mmHg. At -50 mmHg, original CSAs generated 1.18 ± 0.31 (mean ± SD) of their normal bodyweight. Subjects generated about one bodyweight at -45 mmHg using their original waist CSA. At -50 mmHg, larger CSAs generated 1.46 ± 0.31 of their normal bodyweight. Subjects generated about one bodyweight at -35 mmHg using their larger waist CSA. These data support our hypothesis.

In this study, the mechanical power generated at the knee and ankle joints and their functional indexes (i.e. damper, strut, spring and motor like-function) were calculated by using 3D kinematic and kinetic data during hopping at 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5 Hz. The effective mechanical advantage (i.e. the ratio between internal and external moment arm) of the knee (EMAK) and ankle (EMAA) and joint stiffness were calculated as well. Joint stiffness increased with frequency whereas positive and negative joint power decreased with it, the ankle power values being always larger (20-50%) than those at the knee. EMAA reached its highest value (0.4) during the propulsive phase at 3 Hz whereas no significant changes in EMAK were observed as a function of frequency in both the absorption and propulsive phases. Knee joint-functional index shifted from a spring to a strut-like function with increasing frequency (from 56 to 8% and from 4 to 51%, respectively) while the ankle operated mainly as a spring (from 90 to 53%), its damper and motor-like indexes being negligible at all frequencies (<5%). Therefore, in hopping, the knee works to dissipate mechanical energy (the combination of its damper and strut indexes increase from 23 to 72% at these frequencies) and the primary source of mechanical power is attributable to the elastic function of the ankle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, these measures do not directly reflect underlying control/movement strategies. We quantified trunk-pelvis coordination during unstable sitting using vector coding (VC) and correlated such coordination with CoP-based outcomes across varying task demands. Thirteen uninjured individuals (11 male/2 female) sat on an unstable chair at four instability levels, in a random order, defined relative to the individual gravitational gradient (∇G): 100, 75, 60, and 45%∇G. VC assessed trunk-pelvic coordination, and coupling angles classified movements as: 1) anti-phase, 2) in-phase, 3) trunk-phase, or 4) pelvic-phase. With decreasing %∇G (i.e., increasing instability), we found: increased anti-phase movement in the sagittal and frontal planes; decreased in-phase movement in the sagittal and frontal planes; and increased in-phase and pelvic-phase movement in the transverse plane. In the sagittal and frontal planes, we observed significant weak-to-moderate correlations between anti-phase and in-phase movements (0.288 < |ρ| < 0.549). Correlations between CoP-based measures and pelvic-phase and trunk-phase movements were typically weak and/or non-significant (|ρ| < 0.318). VC techniques discriminated between levels of instability during unstable sitting, identifying in-phase coordination (stiffening strategy) at lower instability levels and anti-phase coordination at higher instability levels. Compared to CoP-based measures, trunk coordination outcomes during unstable sitting provide measures of TPC that more directly quantify underlying movement strategies.

Compensatory stepping and slipping limb control are crucial to reduce gait-slip fall-risk. Given the unpredictable intensities of real-life perturbations, this study aimed to determine whether recovery from paretic or non-paretic slips vary as a function of perturbation intensity among PwCS. Forty-four PwCS were assigned to non-paretic low intensity slip, non-paretic high intensity slip, paretic low intensity slip, or paretic high intensity slip group. Participants were subjected to a novel overground gait-slip with a distance of 24 cm (low) or 45 cm (high), under either limb. Recovery strategies, center of mass (CoM) state stability and slipping kinematics were analyzed. Both non-paretic high and low intensity groups demonstrated similar percentage of aborted and recovery stepping, however, paretic high intensity group demonstrated greater aborted stepping (p > 0.05). Both high and low intensity paretic slip groups demonstrated reduced post-slip CoM stability relative to the non-paretic slip groups (p < 0.05). Slip displacement was greater in paretic high group compared with non-paretic high group (p < 0.05). Greater slip displacement at higher intensity was noted only in paretic slip group (p < 0.05). The slip velocity was faster in paretic groups compared to non-paretic slip groups (p < 0.05). Paretic slips showed lower stability at both intensities associated with difficulty in modulating slipping kinematics and resorting to an increased aborted stepping strategy compared to non-paretic slip.

Limb flexions due to daily walk expose the femoropopliteal arteries and, subsequently, the implanted stents to large cyclic deformations, which may lead to fatigue failure of the smart self-expandable stents. For the first time, this paper utilised the up-to-date measurements of walk-induced motion of a human femoropopliteal artery to investigate the fatigue behaviour of nitinol stent after implantation. The study was carried out by modelling the processes of angioplasty, stent crimping, self-expansion and deformation under diastolic-systolic blood pressure, repetitive bending, torsion and axial compression as well as their combination. The highest risk of fatigue failure of the nitinol stent occurs under a combined loading condition, with the bending contributing the most, followed by compression and torsion. The pulsatile blood pressure alone hardly causes any fatigue failure of the stent. The work is significant for understanding and improving the fatigue performance of nitinol stents through innovative design and procedural optimisation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using a polymer (PEEK) femoral implant reduces the stiffness mismatch between implant and bone, and therefore has the potential to decrease strain shielding. The goal of the current study was to evaluate this potential benefit of PEEK femoral components in cadaveric experiments. Cadaveric femurs were loaded in a materials testing device, while a 3-D digital image correlation set-up captured strains on the surface of the intact femurs and femurs implanted with PEEK and CoCr components. These experimental results were used to validate specimen-specific finite element models, which subsequently were used to assess the effect of metal and PEEK femoral components on the bone strain energy density. The finite element models showed strain maps that were highly comparable to the experimental measurements. The PEEK implant increased strain energy density, relative to the preoperative bone and compared to CoCr. This was most pronounced in the regions directly under the implant and near load contact sites.

Such harmonic structures are represented (at comfortable speed) by the occurrence of the golden ratio as ratio of durations of specific walking and running gait sub-phases. Preliminary experimental evidences suggest that front crawl swimming may behave, under this point of view, like walking and running. This paper aims to demonstrate that a mathematical connection between the golden ratio and the front crawl swimming stroke actually exists, at a pace that plays the role of the comfortable speed in walking and running. Generalized Fibonacci sequences are used to this purpose. They rely on the durations of aggregate phases of the front crawl swimming stroke with a clear physical meaning, while characterizing self-similarity of front crawl strokes in its simple nature and enhanced (stronger) variant. Experimental data on front crawl swimmers illustrate the theoretical derivations, suggesting that the pace playing the role of the comfortable speed in walking and running is the middle/long-distance one, while showing that the self-similarity level increases with the swimming technique and the enhanced self-similarity is associated with the performance of top-level swimmers.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the absence of in vivo measurement, musculoskeletal modeling simulations may provide a viable option for estimating knee joint contact forces in cycling. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of increasing QF on knee joint total (TCF), and medial (MCF) compartment contact force during ergometer cycling. The secondary purpose was to evaluate whether KAbM and knee extension moment are accurate predictors of MCF in cycling. Musculoskeletal simulations were performed to estimate TCF and MCF for sixteen participants cycling at an original QF (150 mm), and wide QF (276 mm), at 80 W and 80 rotations per minute. Paired samples t-tests were used to detect differences between QF conditions. MCF increased significantly, however, TCF did not change at wide QF. Peak knee extensor muscle force did not change at wide QF. Peak knee flexor muscle force was significantly reduced with wide QF. Regression analyses showed KAbM and knee extension moments explained 87.4% of the variance in MCF when considered alongside QF. The increase of MCF may be attributed to increased frontal-plane pedal reaction force moment arm.

In this paper, the effect of such sudden acceleration on a pregnant uterus is investigated. A biomechanical model representing the fundamental dynamic behaviors of a pregnant uterus has been developed. The model relates to the 32nd week of gestation when the fetus is in head-down, occipito-anterior position. Considering the drag and squeeze effects of the amniotic fluid, we derive a comprehensive differential equation that represents the interaction of the uterus and fetus. Solving the governing equation, we obtain the system response to different speed-bump excitations. Using the fetal head injury criterion (HIC = 390), we evaluate the model response. Three risk zones (Low, Medium, and High) are introduced, and the effects of excitation characteristics on HIC are investigated. HIC enhances, sub-exponentially, as the excitation amplitude (width) increases (decreases). Three risk-bounds, corresponding to 25%, 75%, and 100% risk of injury, are developed in the ""width-amplitude"" and the ""frequency-amplitude"" planes. Considering a typical speed-bump of width and excitation amplitude of 0.5 m and 0.12 m, respectively, the driver should not hit the speed-bump at 42 km/h or more. We advise hitting such speed-bumps under 25 km/h, based on this paper's findings. According to the risk-bounds, the injury risk of an arbitrary speed-bump excitation, at any desired vehicle speed, can be determined. The findings can help to understand how a pregnant uterus and fetus are subjected to risk caused by a vehicle passing a speed-bump and to expand our knowledge to improve safety during pregnancy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Between each accelerometer position from the metatarsophalangeal joint to the L5 vertebra, signals exhibited decreased peak acceleration, increased time to peak acceleration, and decreased power spectral density integral of both the 2-14 Hz and 14-58 Hz components, with no further attenuation beyond the L5 vertebra. This resulted in peak accelerations close to vital organs of less than 10% of those at the foot. Following landings from greater heights, peak accelerations measured distally were greater, as was attenuation prior to the L5 position. Active and passive mechanisms within the lower limb therefore contribute to progressive attenuation of accelerations, preventing excessive accelerations from reaching the torso and head, even when distal accelerations are large.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The FDD consists of a metallic microplate placed into the eye sclerocorneal limbus, which creates a virtual path between the anterior chamber and its exterior, allowing the intraocular pressure (IOP) to be kept in a normal range. It also uses the surrounding tissue as a flow regulator in order to provide close values of IOP for a wide range of aqueous humor (AH) flow rates. The Neo Hookean hyperelastic model is used for the solid part, while the Reynolds thin film fluid model is used for the fluid part. On the other hand, a gravitational-driven flow test is implemented in order to validate the simulation process. An in vitro experiment evaluated the flow characteristics of the device implanted in fourteen extirpated pig eyes, giving as a result the best-fit for the Young modulus of the tissue surrounding the device.

The extent to which fluid flow involves redistribution within or flow out of the tendon is not known and could be determined by investigating volume changes. This study aimed to synthesize data on immediate and long-term effects of loading on tendon volume among people with a healthy AT and midportion Achilles tendinopathy (MAT). A secondary aim was to synthesise data from the included studies investigating parallel change in cross-sectional area and length. Systematic electronic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and Scopus from inception until May 2020. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for intervention-induced changes from baseline for all outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using modified version of Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Twelve studies were included in meta-analysis. For healthy AT, there were negligible to small changes in volume following cross-country running (-0.33 [95% CI = -1.11 to 0.45] (P = 0.41)) and isometric exercise (0.01 [95% CI = -0.54 to 0.55] (P = 0.98)) and a large increase at the short-term with 12-week isometric protocol (0.88 [95% CI = -0.10 to1.86] (P = 0.08)).

Bulk fluid flow has been hypothesized in paravascular ""glymphatic"" channels (outer space between the pial membrane and astrocyte endfeet), as well as in the periarterial space (inner space between smooth muscle cells). The plausibility of net flow in these channels due to steady and oscillatory pressures is reviewed, as is that of transport by oscillatory shear-enhanced dispersion in the absence of net flow. Models including 1D branching networks of annular channels and an expanded compartmental model for humans both predict that flow driven by physiologic steady pressure differences is unlikely in both periarterial and paraarterial spaces, whether the spaces are open or filled with porous media. One exception is that a small additional steady pressure difference could drive paraarterial flow if the space is open. The potential that the tracer injection itself could present such a pressure difference is outlined. Oscillatory (peristaltic) wall motion alone has been found to be insufficient to drive significant forward flow. However, a number of hypothesized mechanisms that have yet to be experimentally verified in the brain may create directional flow in combination with wall motion. Shear-augmented dispersion due to oscillatory pressure in channels with a range of porosity has been modeled analytically. Enhancement of axial dispersion is small for periarterial channels. In open paraarterial channels, dispersion enhancement with optimal lateral mixing is large enough that it may explain observed tracer transport without net forward fluid flow.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While several investigations have considered the flow field within the airway and its effect on airway collapse, the effect of breathing on the pharynx region is still poorly understood. We address this gap via a combined experimental and numerical study of the flow field within the pharynx and its impacts upon airway collapse. Two 3D experimental models of the upper airway were constructed based upon computerised tomography scans of a specific patient diagnosed with severe OSA; (i) a transparent, rigid model for flow visualisation, and (ii) a semi-flexible model for understanding the effect of flow on pharynx collapse. Validated simulation results for this geometry indicate that during inhalation, negative pressure (with respect to atmospheric pressure) caused by vortices drives significant narrowing of the pharynx. This narrowing is strongly dependent upon whether inhalation occurs through the nostrils. Thus, the methodology presented here can be used to improve OSA treatment by improving the design methodology for personalised, mandibular advancement splints (MAS) that minimise OSA during sleep.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here we use a rich data set of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle forces recorded during in-situ and in-vivo isometric, isotonic, and cyclic contractions to test the accuracy of forces predicted using Hill-type muscle models. We identified force-length and force-velocity parameters for each individual, and used either these subject-specific intrinsic properties, or population-averaged properties within the models. The modeled forces for cyclic in-vivo and in-situ contractions matched with measured muscle-tendon forces with r2 between 0.70 and 0.86, and root-mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.10 to 0.13 (values normalized to the maximum isometric force). The modeled forces were least accurate at the highest movement and cycle frequencies and did not show an improvement in r2 when subject-specific intrinsic properties were used; however, there was a reduction in the RMSE with fewer predictions having higher errors. We additionally recorded and tested muscle models specific to proximal and distal regions of the muscle and compared them to measures and models from the whole muscle belly: there was no improvement in model performance when using data from specific anatomical regions.

Player position appears to influence the risk of concussion but there is limited work on its effect on the risk of CTE. Computational modelling has shown that large brain deformations during head impacts co-localise with CTE pathology in sulci. Here we test whether player position has an effect on brain deformation within the sulci, a possible biomechanical trigger for CTE. We physically reconstructed 148 head impact events from video footage of American Football games. Players were separated into 3 different position profiles based on the magnitude and frequency of impacts. A detailed finite element model of TBI was then used to predict Green-Lagrange strain and strain rate across the brain and in sulci. Using a one-way ANOVA, we found that in positions where players were exposed to large magnitude and low frequency impacts (e.g. defensive back and wide receiver), strain and strain rate across the brain and in sulci were highest. We also found that rotational head motion is a key determinant in producing large strains and strain rates in the sulci. Our results suggest that player position has a significant effect on impact kinematics, influencing the magnitude of deformations within sulci, which spatially corresponds to where CTE pathology is observed. This work can inform future studies investigating different player-position risks for concussion and CTE and guide design of prevention systems.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet, our ability to confine the deposition of inhalation aerosols to specific lung regions, or local airways, remains still widely beyond reach. It has been hypothesized that by coupling magnetic particles to inhaled therapeutics the ability to locally target airway sites can be substantially improved. Although the underlying principle has shown promise in seminal in vivo animal experiments as well as in vitro and in silico studies, its practical implementation has come short of delivering efficient localized airway targeting. Here, we demonstrate in an in vitro proof-of-concept an inhalation framework to leverage magnetically-loaded aerosols for airway targeting in the presence of an external magnetic field. By coupling the delivery of a short pulsed bolus of sub-micron (~500 nm diameter) droplet aerosols with a custom ventilation machine that tracks the volume of air inhaled past the bolus, focused targeting can be maximized during a breath hold maneuver. Specifically, we visualize the motion of the pulsed SPION-laden (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) aerosol bolus and quantify under microscopy ensuing deposition patterns in reconstructed 3D airway models. Our aerosol inhalation platform allows for the first time to deposit inhaled particles to specific airway sites while minimizing undesired deposition across the remaining airspace, in an effort to significantly augment the targeting efficiency (i.e. deposition ratio between targeted and untargeted regions).

However, the segmentation process and model generation are generally not automatized in their entirety. Even with a rigorous protocol, the operator might add uncertainties during the creation of the model. The aim of this study was to evaluate a µQCT-based model of mice tumoral and sham tibias in terms of the variabilities induced by the operator and sensitivity to operator-dependent variables (such as model orientation or length). Two different operators generated finite element (FE) models from µCT images of 8 female Balb/c nude mice tibias aged 10 weeks old with bone tumors induced in the right tibia and with sham injection in the left. From these models, predicted failure load was determined for two different boundary conditions: fixed support and spherical joints. The difference between the predicted and experimental failure load of both operators was large (-122% to 93%). The difference in the predicted failure load between operators was less for the spherical joints boundary conditions (9.8%) than for the fixed support (58.3%), p < 0.001, whereas varying the orientation of bone tibia caused more variability for the fixed support boundary condition (44.7%) than for the spherical joints (9.1%), p < 0.002. Varying tibia length had no significant effect, regardless of boundary conditions (<4%). When using the same mesh and same orientation, the difference between operators is non-significant (<6%) for each model.

The objective of this study is to establish a predictive computational model for the volumetric growth of pulmonary arterial (PA) tissue following complex cardiovascular patch reconstructive surgeries for congenital heart disease patients. For the first time in the literature, the growth mechanics and performance of artificial cardiovascular patches in contact with the growing PA tissue domain is established. An elastic-growing material model was developed in the open source FEBio software suite to first examine the surgical patch reconstruction process for an idealized main PA anatomy as a benchmark model and then for the patient-specific PA of a newborn. Following patch reconstruction, high levels of stress and strain are compensated by growth on the arterial tissue. As this growth progresses, the arterial tissue is predicted to stiffen to limit elastic deformations. We simulated this arterial growth up to the age of 18 years, when somatic growth plateaus. Our research findings show that the non-growing patch material remains in a low strain state throughout the simulation timeline, while experiencing high stress hot-spots. Arterial tissue growth along the surgical stitch lines is triggered mainly due to PA geometry and blood pressure, rather than due to material property differences in the artificial and native tissue. Thus, non-uniform growth patterns are observed along the arterial tissue proximal to the sutured boundaries. This computational approach is effective for the pre-surgical planning of complex patch surgeries to quantify the unbalanced growth of native arteries and artificial non-growing materials to develop optimal patch biomechanics for improved postoperative outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Continuum methods fail to capture such molecular-scale mechanisms. A multiscale numerical model was developed to simulate this activation process, where a Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) model of viscous blood flow is interfaced with a Coarse Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) platelet model. Embedded in DPD blood flow, the macroscopic dynamic stresses are interactively transferred to the CGMD model, inducing intra-platelet associated events. The platelets activate by a biomechanical transductive linkage chain and dynamically change their shape in response. The models are fully coupled via a hybrid-potential interface and multiple time-stepping (MTS) schemes for handling the disparity between the spatiotemporal scales. Cumulative hemodynamic stresses that may lead to platelet activation are mapped on the surface membrane and simultaneously transmitted to the cytoplasm and cytoskeleton. Upon activation, the flowing platelets lose their quiescent discoid shape and evolve by forming filopodia. The model predictions were validated by a set of in vitro experiments, Platelets were exposed to various combinations of shear stresses and durations in our programmable hemodynamic shearing device (HSD). Their shape change was measured at multiple time points using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The CGMD model parameters were fine-tuned by interrogating a parameter space established in these experiments. Segmentation of the SEM imaging streams was conducted by a deep machine learning system.

Secondary screw perforation is a prominent mode of failure for PHF and typically requires reoperation. The anatomical fracture reduction is an essential factor to prevent fixation failure. However, recent studies indicate that the risk of secondary screw perforation may increase if the articular surface is perforated during predrilling of the screw boreholes (overdrilling). This study aimed to determine whether overdrilling increases the risk of secondary screw perforation in unstable PHF. Nine pairs of human cadaveric proximal humeri were osteotomized to simulate a malreduced and highly unstable 3-part fracture (AO/OTA 11 B1.1), followed by their assignment to two study groups for overdrilling or accurate predrilling in paired design, and fixation with a locking plate. Overdrilling was defined by drilling the calcar screw's boreholes through the articular surface. All humeri were cyclically loaded to screw perforation failure. Number of cycles to initial screw loosening and final perforation failure were analysed. The accurately predrilled group revealed a significantly higher number of cycles to both initial screw loosening (p < 0.01) and final screw perforation failure (p = 0.02), compared to the overdrilled one. This is the first study reporting that drilling to the correct depth significantly increases endurance until screw perforation failure during cyclic loading after locked plating in a highly unstable PHF model. Prevention of overdrilling the boreholes could help reduce failure rates of locked plating. Future work should investigate the prevalence and consequences of overdrilling in clinics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this work was to better understand the underlying postural control mechanisms, specifically the interplay of COP oscillations and sensory information flow on keeping the COM stable. Eighteen volunteers took part of the experiment divided into three parts based on sensory conditions: eyes opened, eyes closed and eyes closed with lightly touching a fixed object with one finger. Throughout each part the participants had to quietly stand for 335 s. In the middle of each part, we stabilized their COM for 105 s using a robotized waist-pull system. We recorded whole-body kinematics, COP oscillations, electromyographic activity of soleus and tibialis anterior muscles and the force applied by the finger during light touch conditions. The variability of COP significantly decreased when the COM was stabilized in all sensory conditions. The interaction between sensory condition and stabilization was also significant with different decline of COP variability between quiet standing and stabilization part in all three different sensory conditions. Ankle and knee angle variability decreased significantly while the hip angle variability did not. Our findings suggest that COP is not moving to explore the environment, but to attenuate oscillations of the COM. However, possible functional aspect of movement variability to keep the COM stable still remains.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Detection of acoustic emissions in bone can be used to identify fractures more sensitively and at an earlier inception time compared to traditional methods. However, high rate loading conditions, complex specimen-device interaction or geometry may cause other acoustic signals. Therefore, characterization of the isolated local acoustic emission response from cortical bone fracture is essential to distinguish its characteristics from other potential acoustic sources. This work develops a technique to use acoustic emission signals to determine when cortical bone failure occurs by characterization using both a Welch power spectral density estimate and a continuous wavelet transform. Isolated cortical shell specimens from thoracic vertebral bodies with attached acoustic sensors were subjected to quasistatic loading until failure. The resulting acoustic emissions had a wideband frequency response with peaks from 20 to 900 kHz, with the spectral peaks clustered in three bands of frequencies (166 ± 52.6 kHz, 379 ± 37.2 kHz, and 668 ± 63.4 kHz). Using these frequency bands, acoustic emissions can be used as a monitoring tool in biomechanical spine testing, distinguishing bone failure from structural response.

Notably, biomechanical comparisons between younger or older populations may obscure detected differences in underlying shoulder motion. Herein, biplane fluoroscopy and skin-marker motion analysis quantified humerothoracic, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral motion during 3 static poses (resting neutral, internal rotation to L4-L5, and internal rotation to maximum reach) and 2 dynamic activities (scapular plane abduction and external rotation in adduction). Orientations during static poses and rotations during active ROM were compared between subjects <35 years and >45 years of age (N = 10 subjects per group). Numerous age-related kinematic differences were measured, ranging 5-22°, where variations in scapular orientation and motion were consistently observed. These disparities are on par with or exceed mean clinically important differences and standard error of measurement of clinical ROM, which indicates that high resolution techniques and appropriately matched controls are required to avoid confounding results of studies that investigate shoulder kinematics.

Namely, five different continuum transport models were developed to study biochemicals that originate from the blood and the leaflets, as well as residence-time and flow stagnation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and platelet activation were studied for their role in calcification and thrombosis, respectively. Coherent structures were identified using vorticity and Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) for the 2D and 3D models, respectively. A very close connection between vortex structures and biochemical concentration patterns was shown where different vortices controlled the concentration patterns depending on the transport mechanism.

Although data-driven modeling presents a promising new approach, it has yet to be extended to the modeling of large-deformation biological tissues. Herein, we extend our recent local convexity data-driven (LCDD) framework (He and Chen, 2020) to model the mechanical response of a porcine heart mitral valve posterior leaflet. The predictability of the LCDD framework by using various combinations of biaxial and pure shear training protocols are investigated, and its effectiveness is compared with a full structural, phenomenological model modified from Zhang et al. (2016) and a continuum phenomenological Fung-type model (Tong and Fung, 1976). We show that the predictivity of the proposed LCDD nonlinear solver is generally less sensitive to the type of loading protocols (biaxial and pure shear) used in the data set, while more sensitive to the insufficient coverage of the experimental data when compared to the predictivity of the two selected phenomenological models. While no pre-defined functional form in the material model is necessary in LCDD, this study reinstates the importance of having sufficiently rich data coverage in the date-driven and machine learning type of approaches. It is also shown that the proposed LCDD method is an enhancement over the earlier distance-minimization data-driven (DMDD) against noisy data. This study demonstrates that when sufficient data is available, data-driven computing can be an alternative method for modeling complex biological materials.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous experiments have shown that highly compliant poles with a natural frequency lower than step frequency are more economical than rigid poles during load carriage in walking and this was successfully explained in later modeling studies. However, an energetic benefit was not observed during running with highly compliant poles. We speculate that gait type (running versus walking) may be a factor accounting for the different observations. An optimization-based biped model is adopted to predict the energy cost of load carriage with poles during running, with the parameters from previous experimental studies. The predicted load motion and load-body interaction force agree well with experimental measurements. Compared to running with rigid poles, the highly compliant pole results in reduced peak ground reaction force, longer stance phase duration, and higher energy cost. The changes in running energetics are further found to depend on the natural frequency of the load-pole system relative to the step frequency, but with an opposite trend compared to the changes in walking energetics during pole carriage. Highly compliant poles cost more energy than rigid poles during running, while stiffer poles with a higher natural frequency may offer energetic benefits. This study indicates that the fundamental difference in gait type has a profound influence on the energetic performance of load-carrying devices and this should be taken into consideration in future device designs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, no algorithm evaluating the instantaneous swimming velocity has been validated on the four swimming strokes, or on dive start. Our objective is to develop and validate a new method to measure instantaneous swimming velocity on athletes presenting various musculoskeletal and neurological impairments and swimming one of the four swimming strokes. Seven Paralympic athletes were involved and performed a total of 18 trials of 50 m in real conditions. All trials were recorded with a 3-axis accelerometer, a tethered device and a video camera. The instantaneous velocity was computed by drift-free integration of the forward acceleration. For all trials, Bland-Altman analyses showed a bias of 0.03-0.06 m.s-1 with the tethered device, with 95% LOA lower than 0.31-0.80 m.s-1, RMSE was 0.14-0.39 m.s-1, and ICC amounted 0.494-0.941. No significant difference was found for the mean 50 m velocities between the accelerometer, the tethered device and the video camera. The results obtained for freestyle were comparable to those obtained with GPS in outdoor pools. Those obtained for backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly were very encouraging.

We believe that this aspect discourages the use of computational models even when appropriate data are available and personalised biomechanical analysis would be beneficial. In this paper we present a computational tool that enables the fully automatic generation of skeletal models of the lower limb from three-dimensional bone geometries, normally obtained by segmentation of medical images. This tool was evaluated against four manually created lower limb models finding remarkable agreement in the computed joint parameters, well within human operator repeatability. The coordinate systems origins were identified with maximum differences between 0.5 mm (hip joint) and 5.9 mm (subtalar joint), while the joint axes presented discrepancies between 1° (knee joint) to 11° (subtalar joint). To prove the robustness of the methodology, the models were built from four datasets including both genders, anatomies ranging from juvenile to elderly and bone geometries reconstructed from high-quality computed tomography as well as lower-quality magnetic resonance imaging scans. The entire workflow, implemented in MATLAB scripting language, executed in seconds and required no operator intervention, creating lower extremity models ready to use for kinematic and kinetic analysis or as baselines for more advanced musculoskeletal modelling approaches, of which we provide some practical examples. We auspicate that this technical advancement, together with upcoming progress in medical image segmentation techniques, will promote the use of personalised models in larger-scale studies than those hitherto undertaken.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is indicative of the muscle's potential to contribute to actuation of a joint in a particular joint motion direction and defines the role of the muscle, for example, as a joint flexor or abductor. The aims of this study were, firstly, to measure the moment arms of the flexor and extensor muscles of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and the moment arms of the major abductor and adductor muscles of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of each finger in the hand; secondly, to assess the effect of change in joint angle on these moment arms; and thirdly, to determine if there are differences in a given flexor or extensor's muscle moment arms between the joints it spans on a given finger, and across its tendon slips to multiple fingers. The tendon-excursion method was used to measure instantaneous muscle moment arms in nine fresh-frozen entire forearm cadaver specimens. Joint flexion angle was found to have significant effects on the moment arms of the extensor muscles at the MCP and PIP joints (p < 0.05). In contrast, the digital flexor muscles maintained relatively constant moment arms through the range of joint flexion. The moment arms of the digital flexors and extensors spanning multiple joints in a finger were largest at the MCP joints and smallest at the DIP joints. The findings demonstrate greater torque generating capacity for tasks such as grasping at the proximal interphalangeal joints, and smaller torque capacity for finer movement control at the distal interphalangeal joints.

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women poses natural difficulties in achieving axial and rotational femoral stem stability. The present study examined contributing demographic, surgery-related and postoperative factors in determining the magnitude of early stem migration prior to osseointegration. A prospective cohort of 65 postmenopausal women with hip osteoarthritis (Dorr type A or B femur anatomy) underwent THA with implantation of an uncemented parallel-sided femoral component. Postoperative femoral stem translation and rotation were measured using model-based radiostereometric analysis. Based on analysis of covariance, which controlled for outliers and randomized antiresorptive treatment with denosumab or placebo, none of the analyzed demographics (including BMI) and surgery-related variables (including the stem-to-canal fil ratio) was associated with stem subsidence. Stem subsidence (mean 1.8 mm, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4) occurred even in women with normal hip BMD. Total hip BMD and postoperative walking activity (measured three months after surgery) were significantly associated with stem rotation, and height acted as a confounding factor. The effect of walking activity on stem rotation was significant at 5 months (p = 0.0083) and at 11 months (p = 0.0117). This observation confirms the previous results of instrumented hip prostheses on torsional moments affecting stems during daily activities.

The knowledge of the contribution of smooth muscle cells (SMC) to the response of endothelial cell (EC) to WSS is still incomplete. We developed a co-culture model of EC on top of SMC that mimics the inner in vivo structure of the arterial intima of large arteries. The co-cultured model, as well as a monolayer model of EC, were developed in custom-designed wells that allowed for mechanobiology experiments. Both the monolayer and co-culture models were exposed to steady flow induced WSS of up to 24 dyne/cm2 and for lengths of 60 min. Quantification of WSS induced alterations in the cytoskeletal actin filaments (F-actin) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) junctions were utilized from confocal images and flow cytometry. High confluency of both models was observed even after exposure to the high WSS. The quantitive analysis revealed larger post WSS amounts of EC F-actin polymerization in the monolayer, which may be explained by the relative help of the SMC to resist the external load of WSS. The VE-cadherin demonstrated morphological alterations in the monolayer model, but without significant changes in their content. The SMC in the co-culture maintained their contractile phenotype post high WSS which is more physiological, but not post low WSS.

Inappropriate trunk control during landing contributes to high knee valgus, with neuromuscular factors related to core stability postulated as the mechanism. This investigation probed the influence of trunk and hip mechanics, including joint stiffness, on knee mechanics, particularly high knee valgus. Specifically, this study quantified lumbar spine and hip joint rotational stiffness (a proxy for mechanical joint stability) during single-leg landing tasks known to be associated with injury risk, particularly in females. Kinematics, kinetics, and 24 channels of electromyography spanning the trunk and hip musculature were measured in 18 healthy female participants. Anatomically detailed EMG-driven musculoskeletal models quantified lumbar spine and hip joint rotational stiffness. The links between peak knee abduction angle and moment with lumbar spine and hip joint rotational stiffness were measured. Hip joint rotational stiffness influenced knee abduction across tasks (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.48 to -0.70, p < 0.05) to reduce valgus deviation. Similarly, transverse plane hip joint rotational stiffness during landings reduced knee abduction moment (R = -0.50, P = 0.03; R = -0.49, P = 0.04), and lumbar spine joint rotational stiffness reduced knee abduction angle and moment but did not consistently reach statistical significance. The control system uses stiffness to control motion. This study demonstrates the importance of proximal (lumbar spine and hip) joint rotational stiffness (i.e. core control stability) during single-leg landing to prevent knee abduction motion.

We examined gait stability and how it is altered by constrained cognitive or motor task in CP and their typically developed (TD) controls. Gait kinematics were recorded using inertial-measurement units (IMU) from 18 patients with hemiplegia (13.5 ± 2.4 years), 12 with diplegia (13.0 ± 2.1 years), and 31 TD controls (13.5 ± 2.2 years) during unconstrained gait, and motor (carrying a tray) and cognitive (word naming) task constrained gait at preferred speed (~400 steps/task). Step duration, its standard deviation and refined-compound-multiscale entropy (RCME) were computed independently for vertical and resultant horizontal accelerations. Gait complexity was higher for patients with CP than TD in all tasks and directions (p < 0.001-0.01), being pronounced in vertical direction, cognitive task and for diplegic patients (p < 0.05-0.001). The gait complexity increased more (i.e. higher dual-task cost) from the unconstrained to the constrained gait in CP compared to TD (p < 0.05). Step duration was similar in all groups (p > 0.586), but its variation was higher in CP than TD (p < 0.001-0.05), and during the constrained than unconstrained gait in all groups (p < 0.01-0.001). The gait in children with CP was more complex and the dual-task cost was higher primarily for children with diplegic CP than TD during cognitive task, indicating that attentional load hinders their gait more.

Scaffolds are artificially porous matrices, meant to promote cell seeding and proliferation, being these properties influenced by the permeability of the structure. This work employed experimental pressure drop tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics models to assess permeability (and fluid streamlines) within different triply periodic minimal surfaces scaffold geometries (Schwarz D, Gyroid and Schwarz P). The pressure outputs from the computational analysis presented a good correlation with the experimental results, with R2 equal to 0.903; they have also shown that a lower porosity may not mean a lower permeability if the geometry is altered, such as the difference between 60% porous Gyroid scaffolds (8.1*10-9 mm2) and 70% porous Schwarz D scaffolds (7.1*10-9 mm2). Fluid streamlines revealed how the Gyroid geometries are the most appropriate design for most bone tissue engineering applications, due to their consistent fluid permeation, followed by Schwarz D. The Schwarz P geometries have shown flat streamlines and significant variation of the permeability with the porosity (an increase of 10% in their porosity lead to an increase in the permeability from 5.1*10-9 mm2 to 11.7*10-9 mm2), which would imply a poor environment for cell seeding and proliferation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and anthropometric measures were obtained from 76 participants (33M, 43F) of varying body composition. Trunk, neck and head (TNH), arm, forearm and hand masses were obtained from DXA scans and center of mass locations (COM) estimated from geometric models. Groups with larger BMIs had lesser hand and forearm mass (%total body mass; p<0.001) and greater TNH mass (p=0.014). Males had greater hand, forearm, and arm masses (p<0.05). TNH COM was inferior in groups with larger BMI (p<0.01) and in males (p=0.006). In females, arm COM was distal in Obese II/III versus Normal (p=0.024).

Some patients with ACL deficiency (ACLD) experience joint instability and require a reconstructive surgery to return to daily routines, some can adapt by limiting their activities while others, called copers, can return to high-level activities with no instability. We investigated the effects of alterations in the knee flexion angle (KFA) and muscle force activations on the stability and biomechanics of ACLD joints at 25, 50, and 75% periods of gait stance. ACLD joint stability is controlled by variations in both KFA and knee muscle forces. For the latter, a parameter called activity index is defined as the ratio of forces in ACL antagonists (quadriceps and gastrocnemii) to those in ACL agonists (hamstrings). Under a greater KFA (2-6° beyond the mean of reported values in healthy subjects), an ACLD joint regains its pre-injury stability levels. The ACLD joint stability also markedly improves at smaller quadriceps and larger hamstrings forces (activity indices of 2.0-3.6 at 25%) at the first half of stance and smaller gastrocnemii and larger hamstrings forces (activity indices of 0.1-1.1 at 50% and 0.1-1.2 at 75%) at the second half of stance.

The amounts, properties and organization of bone constituents at tissue level, are known to influence its mechanical properties. It is then important to investigate the relationship between mechanical behavior and tissue composition at this scale in order to provide a better understanding of bone fragility mechanisms associates with this pathology. Our purpose was to analyze the links between ultra-structural properties and the mechanical behavior of this pathological bone tissue (osteomalacia) at tissue level (mineral and osteoid separately, or global). Four bone biopsies were taken from patients with osteomalacia, and subsequently embedded, sectioned, and polished. Then nanoindentation tests were performed to determine local elastic modulus E, contact hardness Hc and true hardness H for both mineralized and organic bone phases and for the global bone. The creep of the bone was also studied using a special indentation procedure in order to assess visco-elasto-plastic (creep) bone behavior. This allowed a detailed study of the rheological models adapted to the bone and to calculate the parameters associated to a Burgers model. Ultra-structural parameters were measured by Fourier Transform InfraRed Microspectroscopy (FTIRM) on the same position as the indents. The use of rheological models confirmed a significant contribution from the organic phase on the viscous character of bone tissue. The elastic E and the elasto-plastic Hc deformation were correlated to both collagen maturity and Mineral/Matrix. The pure plastic deformation H was only correlated to the mineral phase.

Eighteen young adults (9 males and 9 females) participated in the pelvis release experiment. The pelvis was raised through a rope attached to an electromagnet on the ceiling, so the skin surface barely touches the ultrasound probe, which flush to a Plexiglas plate placed on a force plate.

Performing a sit-to-stand (STS) can be a challenging task for older adults because of age-related declines in neuromuscular strength and coordination. We investigated the effects of different initial foot positions (IFPs) on kinematics, muscle activation patterns, and balance control during a STS in younger and older adults.


METHODS
Ten younger and ten older healthy adults participated in this study. Four symmetric IFPs were studied: (1) reference (REF), (2) toes-out with heels together (TOHT), (3) toes-out (TO), and (4) Wide. Lower-extremity muscle activation patterns and kinetic and kinematic data in the sagittal and frontal planes were measured.


RESULTS
The trunk forward-tilt angle and hip extension torque during uprising were smaller in TO and Wide for both age groups. Postural sway and center of pressure sway area were smallest in TO after completion of uprising with no difference between age groups. Adductor longus and gluteus medius activity was greater in TO than in the other IFPs, and older adults activated these muscles to a greater degree than younger adults.


CONCLUSION
Smaller trunk flexion angles with greater activation of the hip abductor and adductor muscles in TO contributed to improving postural stability during the STS.


SIGNIFICANCE
STS training with a toes-out foot position could be an effective rehabilitation strategy for older adults to strengthen hip muscles that control medio-lateral balance required for balance during a STS.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, only a few studies have investigated the mechanism of apoptosis in mechanically overloaded osteocytes. As mechanically stimulated osteocytes produce nitric oxide (NO), which triggers apoptosis in various cell types, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying apoptosis in mechanically overloaded osteocytes, focusing on intracellular NO. To investigate the effects of force magnitude on apoptosis and intracellular NO production, we isolated osteocytes from DMP1-EGFP mice and subjected them to quantitative local forces via fibronectin-coated micro beads targeting integrin on the cell surface using a magnetic tweezer. Cell shrinkage was microscopically examined, and intracellular NO production was visualized using DAR-4 M. Mechanical stimulation revealed relationships between force magnitude, apoptosis, and intracellular NO production. The application of a smaller force resulted in no significant cell shrinkage or intracellular NO production; however, a larger force caused a rapid increase in intracellular NO production followed by cell shrinkage. Besides, intracellular NOS (NO synthase) inhibition and NO donation revealed the pro-apoptotic roles of NO in osteocytes. L-NAME (NOS inhibitor)-treated cells displayed no significant shrinkage under a larger force, whereas SNP (NO donor)-treated cells showed cell shrinkage and Annexin V fluorescence, indicating apoptosis. Collectively, our study demonstrates that larger force leads to NO production-mediated osteocyte shrinkage, implying an initial apoptotic response and highlighting the importance of NO production in bone damage.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Usage of stiff tandem ureteral stents may decrease stent failure rates. In this paper we combined computational and in vitro models to examine the flow in a malignant ureteral obstruction (MUO) managed by 4 methods of drainage: single soft stent, single stiff stent, soft tandem ureteral stents, and stiff tandem ureteral stents. Pressure at the renal pelvis was the primary outcome of the computational and in vitro models. Different drainage modalities were compared using ANCOVA.

However, little attention has been given to tibial accelerations along the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior axes. Therefore, our purpose was to examine the correlation between peak tibial accelerations and ground reaction force loading rates in the medial-lateral and posterior directions. Eighteen recreational runners were recruited who ran with a rearfoot strike pattern (10 men/ 8 women, mean age (yrs) = 33 ± 11). Tibial accelerations and ground reaction forces were collected while participants ran on an instrumented treadmill at a self-selected speed. Correlations were developed for: a) peak medial and lateral accelerations with lateral and medial loading rates, respectively, b) peak anterior tibial accelerations and posterior loading rates. Significant correlations were found between tibial accelerations and loading rates in all planes. Peak medial tibial accelerations were correlated with lateral loading rates (Rs = 0.86, p < 0.001) and peak lateral tibial accelerations were correlated with peak medial loading rates (Rs = 0.91, p < 0.001). A lower correlation was found between anterior accelerations and posterior loading rates (Rs = 0.51, p = 0.030). Tibial accelerations in the medial-lateral plane seem to be a valid surrogate for the respective ground reaction force measures during running on a treadmill, explaining 74-83% of the variance in loading rates. However, with only 26% of the variance explained, the same may not be true for anterior tibial accelerations and posterior loading rates.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Incidence of rotator cuff tears significantly increases with advancing age, and up to 90% of these tears involve the supraspinatus. Previous literature has shown that aging can lead to inferior mechanics, altered composition, and changes in structural properties of the supraspinatus. However, there is little known about changes in supraspinatus mechanical properties in context of other rotator cuff tendons. Alterations in tendon mechanical properties may indicate damage and an increased risk of rupture, and thus, the purpose of this study was to use a rat model to define age-related alterations in rotator cuff tendon mechanics to determine why the supraspinatus is more susceptible to tears due to aging than the infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor. Fatigue, viscoelastic, and quasi-static properties were evaluated in juvenile, adult, aged, and geriatric rats. Aging ubiquitously and adversely affected all rotator cuff tendons tested, particularly leading to increased stiffness, decreased stress relaxation, and decreased fatigue secant and tangent moduli in geriatric animals, suggesting a common intrinsic mechanism due to aging in all rotator cuff tendons. This study demonstrates that aging has a significant effect on rotator cuff tendon mechanical properties, though the supraspinatus was not preferentially affected. Thus, we are unable to attribute the aging-associated increase in supraspinatus tears to its mechanical response alone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

 Microfluidic devices can be thought of as comprising interconnected miniaturized compartments performing multiple experimental tasks individually or in parallel in an integrated fashion. Due to its small size, portability, and low cost, attempts have been made to incorporate detection assays into microfluidic platforms for diseases such as cancer and infection. Some of these technologies have served as point-of-care and sample-to-answer devices. The methods for detecting biomarkers in different diseases usually share similar principles and can conveniently be adapted to cope with arising health challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one such challenge that is testing the performance of both our conventional and newly-developed disease diagnostic technologies. In this mini-review, we will first look at the progress made in the past few years in applying microfluidics for liquid biopsy and infectious disease detection. Following that, we will use the current pandemic as an example to discuss how such technological advancements can help in the current health challenge and better prepare us for future ones.

In this work, a theoretical, porous media framework, ultimately designed for representing downstream resistance, is presented and compared against an in vitro experimental results. The resistor consists of a poro-elastic tube, with either a constant or variable porosity profile in space. The underlying physics, characterizing the fluid flow through the porous media, is analysed by considering flow variables at different network locations. Backward reflections, originated in the reservoir of the in vitro model, are accounted for through a reflection coefficient imposed as an outflow network condition. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measurements for both the homogenous and heterogeneous porosity conditions. In addition, the comparison allows identification of the range of values representing experimental reservoir reflection coefficients. The pressure drops across the heterogeneous porous media increases with respect to the simpler configuration, whilst flow remains almost unchanged. The effect of some fluid network features, such as tube Young's modulus and fluid viscosity, on the theoretical results is also elucidated, providing a reference for the invitro and insilico simulation of different microvascular conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, a knowledge gap exists regarding associations between spasticity and gait function. This study quantified associations of hamstring and triceps surae spasticity with hip, knee and ankle CP gait patterns. This is a cohort study of children and adolescents [n = 51; 31 male; 20 female; spastic diplegia; Gross Motor Function Classification System I (n = 23) and II (n = 28)] who participated in a clinical consult including gait (Motion Analysis, USA) and modified Tardieu scale (MTS) testing (hamstrings, triceps surae). Shape-based clustering was performed on stance phase sagittal hip, knee and ankle patterns using z-normalized and non-normalized data. Linear regression (R, v3.5.0, R Core Team, Austria) was conducted to assess associations between MTS measures and data clusters (α = 0.05). Shape-clustering revealed two hip and three knee and ankle clusters for z-normalized and non-normalized data. Significant associations of hamstring spasticity and joint patterns were observed for z-normalized knee clusters (CKnee A p = 0.002; CKnee B p = 0.006) and interactions amongst non-normalized hip and knee clusters (CHipA:CKnee B p = 0.033). Trends were observed for soleus spasticity and gastrocnemius range of motion angle and non-normalized ankle clusters (CAnkle B p = 0.051; CAnkle B p = 0.053 respectively).

While aBMD correlates with bone strength, it is a poor predictor of fragility fracture risk. Alternatively, fracture toughness assesses the bone's resistance to crack propagation and fracture, making it a suitable bone quality metric. Here, we explored how femoral midshaft measurements from DXA, micro-computed tomography (µCT), and Raman spectroscopy could predict fracture toughness. We hypothesized that ovariectomy (OVX) decreases aBMD and fracture toughness compared to controls and we can optimize a multivariate assessment of bone quality by combining results from X-ray and Raman spectroscopy. Female mice underwent an OVX (n = 5) or sham (n = 5) surgery at 3 months of age. Femurs were excised 3 months after ovariectomy and assessed with Raman spectroscopy, µCT, and DXA. Subsequently, a notch was created on the anterior side of the mid-diaphysis of the femurs. Three-point bending induced a controlled fracture that initiated at the notch. The OVX mice had a significantly lower aBMD, cortical thickness, and fracture toughness when compared to controls (p < 0.05). A leave one out cross-validated (LOOCV) partial least squares regression (PLSR) model based only on the combination of aBMD and cortical thickness showed no significant predictive correlations with fracture toughness, whereas a PLSR model based on principal components derived from the full Raman spectra yielded significant prediction (r2 = 0.71, p < 0.05). Further, the PLSR model was improved by incorporating aBMD, cortical thickness, and principal components from Raman spectra (r2 = 0.92, p < 0.001). This exploratory study demonstrates combining X-ray with Raman spectroscopy leads to a more accurate assessment of bone fracture toughness and could be a useful diagnostic tool for the assessment of fragility fracture risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, biomechanics differ from 1 g vertical jumping, in particular prolongation of ground contact times (GCT), reduction of peak force, rate of force development (RFD) (and presumably stretch shortening cycle [SSC] efficacy) and stiffness, whilst also requiring relatively complex equipment. Thus, we sought to determine if horizontal spring-loaded countermovement jumps were more analogous to vertical jumping. 9 healthy (5 female) subjects (27 ± 7yrs; 169.0 ± 5.3 cm; 63.6 ± 2.6 kg) performed 10 reactive countermovement jumps vertically, and horizontally (randomized) when lay on a spring-loaded carriage performed against loading (at lift-off) equivalent (±6%) to their body weight. Jump kinetics, kinematics and lower limb/trunk electromyographic activity were compared between conditions (paired t-tests). Mean flight and GCTs did not differ, however, peak jump height (p = 0.003; d = -0.961) was greater when jumping horizontally. In contrast, ground reaction forces (zGRF) during take-off (p < 0.001; d = 1.645) and landing (p = 0.002; d = 1.309), peak acceleration (p = 0.001; d = 1.988), leg stiffness (p = 0.001; d = 2.371) and RFD (p = 0.023; d = 1.255) were lower horizontally. Mean rectus femoris activity was lower during landing (p = 0.033; d = 0.691) when horizontal, but did not differ during either take-off or land-lift. Mean medial gastrocnemius activity was significantly (p = 0.018; d = 0.317) lower during horizontal take-off. Spring-loading (1 g at take-off) maintained short GCTs and flight times presumably maintaining muscle SSC efficacy in a manner that appears intuitive (in young active subjects), simple, robust and potentially compatible with spaceflight. Whether appropriate jump characteristics can be achieved in older subjects and in μg/hypogravity needs to be determined. However, greater jump height, lower peak zGRF, RFD and leg stiffness along with reduced lower limb and trunk muscle activity suggests that 1 g at take-off is insufficient to replicate vertical jump biomechanics. Thus, further investigation is warranted to optimize, and evaluate spring-loaded jumping as a gravity-independent multi-systems countermeasure on Earth, and in Space.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, to date, this important characteristic remains poorly understood in living tissue structures. This study reports the experimental measurement of the in vivo nano-elastic modulus of the tendon in a mouse tail model. The experiment was performed on the tail tendon of an 8-week-old C57BL/6 live mouse. Mechanical loading on tail tendons was regulated by changing both voltage and frequency of alternating current stimulation on the erector spinae. The nano-elastic modulus of the tail tendon was measured by atomic force microscope. The nano-elastic modulus showed significant variation (2.19-35.70 MPa) between different locations and up to 39% decrease under muscle contraction, suggesting a complicated biomechanical environment in which cells dwell. In addition, the nano-elastic modulus of the tail tendon measured in live mice was significantly lower than that measured in vitro, suggesting a disagreement of tissue mechanical properties in vivo and in vitro. This information is important for the designs of new extracellular biomaterial that can better mimic the biological environment, and improve clinical outcomes of musculoskeletal tissue degenerations and associated disorders.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Hence, a cartilage viscoelasticity measurement could be an alternative to traditional imaging methods for osteoarthritis diagnosis. In a previous study, we confirmed the feasibility of viscoelasticity measurement in ex vivo bovine cartilage using the Lamb wave method. However, the wave speed-frequency curve of Lamb wave is totally nonlinear and the cartilage thickness could significantly affect the Lamb wave speed, making wave speed measurements and viscoelasticity inversion difficult. The objective of this study was to measure the cartilage viscoelasticity using the Rayleigh wave method (RWM). Rayleigh wave speed in the ex vivo bovine cartilage was measured, and exists only in the near-source and far-field region. The estimated cartilage elasticity was 0.66 ± 0.05 and 0.59 ± 0.07 MPa for samples 1 and 2, respectively; the estimated cartilage viscosity was 24.2 ± 0.7 and 27.1 ± 1.8 Pa·s for samples 1 and 2, respectively.

Previous works Le et al. (2010, 2013) have shown evidence for a highly dynamic inflow jet in the ostium of brain aneurysms. While it is highly desired to investigate this inflow jet dynamics in clinical practice, the constraints on spatial and temporal resolutions of in vivo data do not allow a detailed analysis of this transition. In this work, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is used to identify the most energetic modes of the inflow jet in patient-specific models of internal carotid aneurysms via the utilization of high-resolution simulation data. It is hypothesized that dynamic modes are not solely controlled by the blood flow waveform at the parent artery. They are also dependent on jet-wall interaction phenomena. DMD analysis shows that the spatial extent of low- frequency modes corresponds well to the most energetic areas of the inflow jet. The high-frequency modes are short-lived and correspond to the flow separation at the proximal neck and the jet's impingement onto the aneurysmal wall. Low-frequency modes can be reconstructed at relatively low spatial and temporal resolutions comparable to ones of in vivo data. The current results suggest that DMD can be practically useful in analyzing blood flow patterns of brain aneurysms with in vivo data.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Traditional sensor-fusion filters are largely reliant on magnetometer readings, which may be disturbed in uncontrolled environments. Careful sensor-to-segment alignment and calibration strategies are also necessary, which may burden users and lead to further error in uncontrolled settings. We introduce a new framework that combines deep learning and top-down optimization to accurately predict lower extremity joint angles directly from inertial data, without relying on magnetometer readings. We trained deep neural networks on a large set of synthetic inertial data derived from a clinical marker-based motion-tracking database of hundreds of subjects. We used data augmentation techniques and an automated calibration approach to reduce error due to variability in sensor placement and limb alignment. On left-out subjects, lower extremity kinematics could be predicted with a mean (±STD) root mean squared error of less than 1.27° (±0.38°) in flexion/extension, less than 2.52° (±0.98°) in ad/abduction, and less than 3.34° (±1.02°) internal/external rotation, across walking and running trials. Errors decreased exponentially with the amount of training data, confirming the need for large datasets when training deep neural networks. While this framework remains to be validated with true inertial measurement unit data, the results presented here are a promising advance toward convenient estimation of gait kinematics in natural environments. Progress in this direction could enable large-scale studies and offer new perspective into disease progression, patient recovery, and sports biomechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Since an incorrect transfer of CoM can lead to balance loss during locomotion, both appropriate foot elevation and CoM position must be controlled and coordinated by adjusting body segment positions. However, no studies have revealed time profiles of CoM position by coordinated segment movements and the relation of foot elevation with CoM position during obstacle crossing. Twenty-five healthy older adults crossed an obstacle (depth: 1 cm, width: 60 cm, height: 8 cm) during comfortable-speed walking. Synergy indices were calculated during lead- and trail-limb swing using uncontrolled manifold analysis. High synergy index values indicate a strong multi-joint kinematic synergy, or co-fluctuations in segment movements, to control CoM position. The maximum foot heights of the swing limbs were calculated as the maximum vertical distance between the most distal foot point and the ground. In the mediolateral direction, synergy index values during early lead-limb swing were significantly greater than during early trail-limb swing, and in the vertical direction, large synergy index values were found during early- and mid-swing phases. Moreover, maximum trail-foot height was correlated to vertical synergy index during early phase. CoM position was not well controlled by a kinematic synergy during trail-limb swing and the low control of CoM position was observed with great trail-foot height. The results suggest that a conservative strategy with great trail-foot height would not always be helpful for successful obstacle crossing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Bi-component T2 mapping measured using Multi-Component Driven Equilibrium Single Shot Observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) is sensitive for detecting cartilage degeneration within the human knee joint, but has not been correlated with cartilage composition and mechanical properties. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between bi-component T2 parameters measured using mcDESPOT at 3.0 T and cartilage composition and mechanical properties. Ex-vivo patellar cartilage specimens harvested from five human cadaveric knees were imaged using mcDESPOT at 3.0 T. Cartilage samples were removed from the patellae, mechanically tested to determine linear modulus and dissipated energy, and chemically tested to determine proteoglycan and collagen content. Parameter maps of single-component T2 relaxation time (T2), the T2 relaxation times of the fast relaxing macromolecular bound water component (T2F) and slow relaxing bulk water component (T2S), and the fraction of the fast relaxing macromolecular bound water component (FF) were compared to mechanical and chemical measures using linear regression. FF was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with energy dissipation and linear modulus. T2 was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) correlated with elastic modulus at 1 Hz and energy dissipated at all frequencies.

The advantage of the PC is that a simple strain-threshold and a tissue volume fraction can be used to predict failure properties. In this study, the PC is compared to materially nonlinear μFE analyses, where the bone tissue is modelled as an elastic, damageable material. The goal was to investigate for which outcomes the PC is sufficient and when a nonlinear (NL) simulation is required. Three types of simulation results were compared: (1) prediction of the failure load, (2) load sharing of cortical and trabecular regions, and (3) distribution of local damaged/overstrained tissue at the maximum sustainable load. The failure load obtained experimentally could be predicted well with both the PC and the NL simulations using linear regression. Although the PC strongly overestimated the failure load, it was sufficient to predict adequately normalized apparent results. An optimised PC (oPC) was proposed which uses experimental data to calibrate the individual volume of overstrained tissue. The main areas of local over-straining predicted by the oPC were the same as estimated by the NL simulation, although the oPC predicted more diffuse regions.

Individuals without mobility impairments have the ability to compensate for variability in foot-placement to maintain their balance; however, it is unknown how individuals respond to unexpected mediolateral perturbations to their foot placement that alter their balance control. The purpose of this study was to identify the biomechanical responses of individuals without mobility impairments to medial and lateral foot-placement perturbations during walking. Three-dimensional body segment kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected from 15 participants at 1.0 m/s and their self-selected speed on an instrumented treadmill. Dynamic balance was assessed by analyzing whole-body angular momentum in the frontal plane. We hypothesized that participants would respond to the perturbations with a combination of a lateral ankle strategy, hip adduction strategy and/or ankle push-off strategy to restore their balance. Overall, the medial perturbations adversely affected dynamic balance while lateral perturbations had little effect. Individuals responded to medial (lateral) perturbations with an increased (decreased) ankle inversion moment, which correlated to lateral (medial) shifts in their foot center of pressure. In addition, individuals responded to medial (lateral) perturbations with a decreased (slightly decreased) hip abduction moment. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe an ankle push-off moment response but rather, a small response in the opposite direction.

Modeling studies have shown weak shoulder adductors lead to compensations from the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles during propulsion, which may lead to altered propulsion mechanics. However, the role recovery phase hand pattern has in pain development is unclear, as each hand pattern is associated with unique mechanics and different levels of muscle demand. Previous research found no correlation between hand pattern and shoulder pain at self-selected speeds. However, fast propulsion may exacerbate poor mechanics caused by shoulder muscle weakness, which may reveal those at risk for pain development. The present study evaluated whether the hand pattern used during fast wheelchair propulsion is correlated with shoulder pain. We also assessed whether shoulder adductor strength was correlated with hand pattern. Fast propulsion data from two subsets of MWCU were analyzed at three time points (baseline, 18 months, 36 months). All participants were pain-free at baseline. Subset 1 compared individuals who remained pain-free to those who developed shoulder pain. Subset 2 compared individuals with chronic pain at follow-up to those whose pain resolved over time. The hand pattern used was not different between groups in either subset. However, more over-rim patterns were correlated with lower adductor strength in Subset 1. These results suggest that although the hand pattern used during fast propulsion is not correlated with shoulder pain, more over-rim hand patterns may indicate weaker shoulder adductors.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Even though rFE is consistently observed in isolated muscle preparations, it is not always observed in human skeletal muscle. This inconsistency might be associated with disociations between length changes in muscle tendon units (MTUs) and fibres. This prompted the question if there is rFE for conditions where the MTU is stretched while fibres shorten. Rabbit tibialis anterior (TA) MTUs (n = 4) were stretched and the isometric forces following stretching were compared to corresponding forces from isometric reference contractions. Unique combinations of stretch speed and activation were used to create conditions of continuous fibre shortening during MTU stretch. Mean force was increased (18 ± 2%) following MTU stretching compared to the isometric reference forces. Without fibre length measurements, this result would be referred to as rFE. However, fibre shortening in the reference contractions was always greater than for the eccentric stretch contractions, suggesting that the observed increase in force might be caused by less residual force depression (rFD) in the stretch tests compared to the reference contractions. However, the work performed by fibre shortening was similar between the reference and the MTU stretch contractions, suggesting that rFD was similar for both experimental conditions. Therefore, we conclude that we observed rFE in the absence of contractile element stretching. However, a lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that distinguish rFE from rFD prevents an unequivocal pronouncement of what caused the enhanced forces after active muscle stretching.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The magnitudes of shear wave speed ratio (rSWS) of the 10 CTS patients (10 hands) and 6 healthy individuals (12 hands), and 10 cadaveric hands were compared using UVE. The ratios of intra to extra-carpal tunnel SWS in CTS patients was significantly higher than those in the healthy individuals (p = 0.0008) and cadaveric hands (p = 0.0015) with 500-g tendon tension. We estimated the CTP in the carpal tunnel using the mean rSWS of each group obtained from the present study and the linear approximation obtain from cadaveric hands data with 500-g tendon tension (y = 0.0036x + 1.1413). These results indicated that the elevated pressure applied to the 3rd flexor digitorum superficialis tendon in the carpal tunnel of CTS patients resulted in faster shear wave propagation. These results show that UVE was useful to indirectly estimate the CTP by measuring the rSWS; thus, they are potentially useful for the early diagnosis and assessment of CTS.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, there is limited data regarding the in vivo biomechanical response of tibiofemoral cartilage to activities of daily living (ADLs) in ACL-deficient knees. In this study, eight otherwise healthy participants with chronic unilateral ACL deficiency completed a stress test to assess the effect of 20 min of level treadmill walking at a speed of 2.5 mph on tibiofemoral cartilage in their ACL-deficient and contralateral ACL-intact knees. Three-dimensional surface models developed from pre- and post-activity magnetic resonance (MR) images of the injured and uninjured knees were used to determine compressive strain across multiple regions of tibiofemoral cartilage (medial and lateral tibial plateaus, medial and lateral femoral condyles, medial aspect of femoral condyle adjacent to intercondylar notch of the femur). In the ACL-deficient knees, we observed significantly increased cartilage strain in the region of the medial femoral condyle adjacent to the intercondylar notch (6% in deficient vs. 2% in contralateral, p = 0.01) as well as across the medial and lateral tibial plateaus (4% vs. 3%, p = 0.01) relative to the contralateral ACL-intact knees. Increased compressive strain at the medial intercondylar notch and tibial plateau suggests alterations in mechanical loading or the response to load in these regions, presumably related to altered knee kinematics. These changes may disrupt cartilage homeostasis and contribute to subsequent development of osteoarthritis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Efforts to objectify the procedure have been undertaken since decades. Assessment of implant load as an indirect predictor of callus maturity has so far failed to enter clinical routine due to limited practicability, technical obstacles and its snap-shot nature. We recently introduced the concept of continuous implant load monitoring to aid in diagnosing fracture healing progression. This study aimed at investigating the feasibility of the system in a clinical context. Ten patients treated with Taylor-Spatial-Frame external fixators following pathological tibia fractures were equipped with a Fracture Monitor device attached to a fixator-strut and were monitored until hardware removal. Two patients were excluded due to technical issues. Implant load and fracture activity was continuously and autonomously measured for 139 ± 89 days (mean ± SD). Data was wirelessly collected with consumer smartphones. Relative implant load initially rose for 34.1 ± 22.2 days and finally declined to a level of 45.0 ± 33.8% of the maximum implant load. In five patients the load dropped below 50% of the maximum load. These patients underwent hardware removal according to the clinical assessment. In three patients, whose external fixators were exchanged to internal fixation at the end of the study, implant load did not drop below the 50% margin. The continuous measurement principle allows resolving implant load progression and appears indicative for the bone healing status. Data can be acquired in a homecare setting and is believed to provide valuable information to support timely healing assessment and enable patient specific after-care.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, there is no validated DXA-based measurement of the Achilles tendon moment arm (dAT). The aims of this study were: 1) to compare in vivo DXA derived measurements of the dAT at rest against two previously validated methods: tendon excursion (TE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at three ankle angles (-5°, 0° and +10°). 2) analyse the intra-day reliability of the DXA method at all ankle angles and compare between methods. Twelve healthy adults (mean ± SD: 31.4 ± 9.5 years; 174.0 ± 9.5 cm; 76.2 ± 16.6 kg) participated in this study, involving test-retest DXA scans, ultrasound scans and one MRI scan. The dAT was defined as the distance from the centre of the calcaneal-tibial joint axis to the Achilles tendon (AT) muscle-tendon line of action. DXA derived dAT measures were significantly greater than MRI measurements (19.7-24.9%) and were 45.2% significantly larger than the TE method. The test-retest reliability of the DXA technique at 0° was high [CV = 1.38%; ICC = 0.96] and despite the consistently larger dAT lengths obtained using DXA, MRI and DEXA data were strongly correlated (r = 0.878, p < 0.001).

A triple-inverted-pendulum model in three-dimensional space, composed of rigid-links of head-arms-trunk (HAT), thigh and shank, was employed. We derived causal relationships that can predict post-impact kinetics, including impact ground reaction forces (GRFs) and corresponding knee joint torques from a given body-kinematics immediately before impact, based on an assumption of a completely inelastic collision between a landing foot (the distal end-point of the shank in the model) and the ground. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) analysis revealed that our model can achieve an acceptable agreement between experimentally measured and model-predicted impact GRFs and corresponding knee joint torques. The 95% one-tailed lower confidence limit of CCC of vertical, mediolateral GRFs and the varus/valgus torque were 0.665>ρc,a=0.643,0.786>ρc,a=0.758 and 0.531>ρc,a=0.508, respectively, for the least acceptable values ρc,a. Using this model, effects of three types of hypothetical pre-impact kinematics with modulated (i) medial/lateral leaning HAT angle, (ii) forward/backward HAT tilt-angle, and (iii) knee flexion/extension angle on the impact GRF and corresponding knee joint torque were evaluated. We showed that the smaller knee flexion and the greater HAT leaning toward the landing-limb-side, the larger the knee valgus torque is generated, as a mechanical consequence between the specific pre-impact kinematics and the knee loading associated with the risk of ACL injury. Further exploration of hypothetical kinematics using the model in the future work might contribute to identifying the risky landing kinematics beyond experimental limitations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

When combined with specified loading conditions, assessment of strain fields can be used to craft models that accurately represent the mechanical behavior of soft tissue. Inhomogeneities in strain fields may be indicative of normal or pathological inhomogeneities in mechanical properties. In this study, we present the validation of a modified Demons registration algorithm for non-contact, marker-less strain measurement of tissue undergoing uniaxial loading. We validate the algorithm on a synthetic dataset composed of artificial deformation fields applied to a speckle image, as well as images of aortic sections of varying perceptual quality. Initial results indicate that Demons outperforms recent Optical Flow and Digital Image Correlation methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to low image quality, with similar runtimes. Demons achieves at least 8% lower maximal deviation from ground truth on 50% biaxial and shear strain applied to aortic images. To illustrate utility, we quantified strain fields of multiple human aortic specimens undergoing uniaxial tensile testing, noting the formation of strain concentrations in areas of rupture.

Twenty healthy adults walked on a laboratory walkway while synchronized biplane radiographs of the ankle and hindfoot were collected at 100 frames/s. A validated tracking technique was used to measure tibiotalar and subtalar kinematics. Differences between male and female range of motion (ROM) were observed only in tibiotalar (AP and ML) and subtalar (ML) translation (all differences<1 mm and all p < 0.04). Statistical parametric mapping identified differences between kinematics waveforms of males and females in tibiotalar translation (AP and ML) and eversion, and subtalar ML translation. No differences between dominant and non-dominant sides were observed in ROM or kinematics waveforms. The average absolute side-to-side difference in the kinematics waveforms was 4.1° and 1.5 mm or less for all rotations and translations, respectively. Tibiotalar plantarflexion was coupled to subtalar inversion and eversion during the impact and push-off phases of stance (r = 0.90 and r = 0.87, respectively).

Our objective was to establish how rehabilitation (muscle strengthening and movement training), simulated with a musculoskeletal model and probabilistic analyses, alters hip joint reaction forces (JRF) in patients with DDH during a single limb squat. In four patients with DDH, hip abductor strengthening was simulated by increasing the maximum isometric force value between 0 and 32.6% and movement training was simulated by decreasing the hip adduction angle between 0 and 10° relative to baseline. 2,000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed separately to simulate strengthening and movement training, from which 99% confidence bounds and sensitivity factors were calculated. Our results indicated that simulated movement training aimed at decreasing hip adduction had a substantially larger influence on hip JRF than strengthening, as indicated by 99% confidence bounds of the resultant JRF (0.88 ± 0.55 xBW vs. 0.31 ± 0.12 xBW, respectively). Relative to baseline, movement training that resulted in a 10° decrease in hip adduction decreased the resultant JRF by 0.78 ± 0.65 xBW, while strengthening the abductors by 17.6% increased resultant JRF by 0.18 ± 0.06 xBW.

Replacement of the failing valve with a prosthesis generally improves patient outcomes but leaves the patient with non-physiological intracardiac flow patterns that might contribute to their future risk of thrombus formation and embolism. It has been suggested that the angular orientation of the implanted valve might modify the postoperative distortion of the intraventricular flow field. In this study, we investigated the effect of prosthetic valve orientation on LV flow patterns by using heart geometry from a patient with LV dysfunction and a competent native mitral valve to calculate intracardiac flow fields with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Results were validated using in vivo 4D Flow MRI. The computed flow fields were compared to calculations following virtual implantation of a mechanical heart valve oriented in four different angles to assess the effect of leaflet position. Flow patterns were visualized in long- and short-axes and quantified with flow component analysis. In comparison to a native valve, valve implantation increased the proportion of the mitral inflow remaining in the basal region and further increased the residual volume in the apical area. Only slight changes due to valve orientation were observed. Using our numerical framework, we demonstrated quantitative changes in left ventricular blood flow due to prosthetic mitral replacement. This framework may be used to improve design of prosthetic heart valves and implantation procedures to minimize the potential for apical flow stasis, and potentially assist personalized treatment planning.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The primary purposes in this study were to determine the effects of tracking of running motion capture data to a model (1) with and without coupling of lumbar spine segments, and (2) with varying combinations of spinal markers. Running trials were collected from 7 participants, with each at three different speeds. The motion data was fit to the Full-Body Lumbar Spine Model (FBLS) with coupling of the lumbar spine enabled (CS) and disabled and therefore rigid (RS) in OpenSim through the Inverse Kinematics tool (IK). Different combinations of markers were chosen as tracking inputs for IK to represent experimental data collection with different marker sets. Root-mean-square (RMS) marker errors of all 13 markers along the spine for each gait cycle were calculated. The CS model resulted in 23.7% lower errors than the RS model (p < 0.001). The marker subset analysis showed that increasing the number of markers in the experimental data collection decreases the error, with the four marker tracking subsets with the highest number of markers tracked having the lowest errors. The location of the marker and timing in the gait cycle did not affect marker error. When spinal mechanics are of interest, the inclusion of a coupled lumbar spine in the model and a larger spinal marker set help better track experimental kinematics when fitting to a model.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Semi-automated, finite element (FE) morphing techniques eliminate the need for segmentation and have shown to accelerate the generation of multiple specimen-specific pelvic FE models to enable the study of pelvic mechanical behaviour. The purpose of this research was to produce simulated human pelvic FE models representing android, gynecoid, anthropoid and platypelloid morphologies and to isolate differences in strain patterns due to anatomic shape under physiologic loading. Using five initially generated specimen-specific FE models, each specimen-specific FE model was reconfigured into three different morphologies using FE mesh morphing techniques. Significantly different strains were found comparing the gynecoid (classical female pelvis') to the android ('true male pelvis') models (p = 0.040), with strains twice as high in the superior pubic rami. No significant differences were seen in comparing overall strains between the other pelvic shapes (p = 0.61-0.126). The highest strain regions in all models were found in the supra-acetabular regions, with high strains also found in the regions of the superior pubic rami, the greater sciatic notch and sacral regions about the L5 vertebrae. Quantifying the contributions of shape to strain in the pelvis may increase the understanding of sex and patient-specific differences in fracture risk and motivate the consideration of treatment strategies that account for anatomic pelvic differences.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Marker placement is an important source of methodological variability within human motion analysis. It is currently unclear how marker placement error effects the interpretation of biomechanical asymmetries throughout post ACLR rehabilitation. The aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of random marker placement variation on the interpretation of inter-limb differences during a change of direction (CoD) task. Forty-seven participants 9 months post-ACLR and fifty uninjured controls completed a 90° CoD task on both limbs. Inter-limb differences in kinematic and kinetic metrics during the CoD stance phase were calculated for both groups using the Vicon Plug-in Gait model, and ACLR subjects were classified as having 'normal' or 'abnormal' inter-limb differences relative to the control group. Simulated random marker displacements based on published marker placement error ranges were then repeatedly applied to the lateral thigh, femoral epicondyle and tibia markers. ACLR inter-limb differences were recalculated each time, allowing the estimation of 95% confidence intervals and minimal identifiable between-session changes. ACLR subjects were also reclassified relative to the control group after each simulation and the percentage of participants to change classification was calculated. Marker displacements caused large deviations in inter-limb difference measures in several variables including hip rotation angle, knee abduction angle and knee abduction moment, thus limiting the ability to identify participants with large inter-limb differences relative to a control group. These findings highlight the challenges in using marker-based biomechanical models to conduct objective assessments of inter-limb differences during CoD tasks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, their non-invasive determination is not widely available. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present a novel approach for the non-invasive determination of vessel's distensibility and elastic modulus. Simultaneous measurements of vessel's Diameter (D) and flow velocity (U) were recorded to determine local wave speed (nC) in flexible tubes and calf aortas non-invasively using the lnDU-loop method, which was used to calculate the Distensibility (nDs) and Elastic Modulus (nE), also non-invasively. To validate the new approach, the non-invasive results were compared to traditionally invasive measurements of Dynamic Distensibility (Dsd) and Tangential Elastic Modulus (Em). In flexible tubes, the average nDs was higher and nE was lower than Dsd and Em by 1.6% and 6.9%, respectively. In calf aortas, the results of nDs and nE agreed well with those of Dsd and Em, as demonstrated by Bland-Altman technique. The results of nDs and nE are comparable to those determined using traditional techniques.

Minor hockey is a different game when compared to elite players presenting distinctive risk factors for each age division. Objective measures of brain trauma exposure were documented for six divisions in minor ice hockey; U7, U9, U11, U13, U15, U18. Game video analysis, physical reconstruction and computational modelling was employed to capture the event conditions, frequency of impacts, frequency of high strain magnitude (>0.17) impacts, and cumulative trauma. The results showed proportional differences in the event conditions; event type, closing velocity, and head impact location, informing the improvement of age appropriate protection, testing protocols, and safety standards. Frequency of events were highest for U7 when players were learning to skate, and again in U18 as game physicality increases. No significant difference was observed in frequency of high magnitude impacts across age divisions. A peak in high magnitude impacts was empirically observed at both U7 and U15 where skill development in skating and body checking, respectively, were most prominent. Finally, a cumulative trauma metric incorporating frequency and magnitude of impacts provided a detailed analysis of trauma exposure provides for a targeted approach to managing injury risk specific to age division.

By representing experimentally observed calcium induced stiffening and actin-titin interaction induced reduced free spring length effects of active state titin in our linked fiber-matrix mesh finite element model, our aim was to study the mechanism of effects and particularly to determine the functionally more effective active state titin model. Isolated EDL muscle of the rat was modeled and three cases were studied: passive state titin (no change in titin constitutive equation in the active state), active state titin-I (constitutive equation involves a higher stiffness in the active state) and active state titin-II (constitutive equation also involves a strain shift coefficient accounting for titin's reduced free spring length). Isometric muscle lengthening was imposed (initial to long length, lm = 28.7 mm to 32.7 mm). Compared to passive state titin, (i) active state titin-I and II elevates muscle total (lm = 32.7 mm: 14% and 29%, respectively) and active (lm = 32.7 mm: 37.5% and 77.4%, respectively) forces, (ii) active state titin-II also shifts muscle's optimum length to a longer length (lm = 29.6 mm), (iii) active state titin-I and II limits sarcomere shortening (lm = 32.7 mm: up to 10% and 20%, respectively). Such shorter sarcomere effect characterizes active state titin's mechanism of effects.

Subjects with non-specific subacute and chronic LBP were screened 6 weeks following an episode. Functional tests were bending trunk test, sock test and sit to stand test. Participants performed as many repetitions as possible during 30 s for each functional test. Angular displacement, velocity and acceleration, linear acceleration, time and repetitions were analysed. Participants were divided into two groups to determine their different LBP severity with a k-means clusters according to the results obtained in Roland Morris questionnaire (RMQ). Comparing different severity groups based on RMQ score (high impact = 17.15, low impact = 7.47), bending trunk test obtained significative differences in linear acceleration (p = 0.002-0.01).

The most common numerical tool is the finite element method (FEM). However, this method crucially depends on the mesh quality. For complex geometries such as cardiac structures, it is convenient to use tetrahedral discretisations which can be generated automatically. On the other hand, such automatic meshing with tetrahedrons together with large deformations often lead to elements distortion and volumetric locking. To overcome these difficulties, different smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) have been proposed in the recent years. They are known to be volumetric locking free, less sensitive to mesh distortion and so far have been used e.g. in simulation of passive cardiac mechanics. In this work, we extend for the first time node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM) towards active cardiac mechanics. Firstly, the sensitivity to mesh distortion is tested and compared to that of FEM. Secondly, an active contraction in circumferentially aligned fibre direction is modelled in the healthy and the infarcted case. We show, that the proposed method is more robust with respect to mesh distortion and computationally more efficient than standard FEM. Being furthermore free of volumetric locking problems makes S-FEM a promising alternative in modelling of active cardiac mechanics, respectively electromechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While previous investigations have compared gait biomechanics from different laboratories assessed by different raters, estimates of relative reliability, measurement error, and thresholds for real change are still unknown. These metrics are imperative to interpret multi-centre study results. Therefore, we examined the reliability of gait biomechanics assessed in two different laboratories, by two different raters, and using the same study sample. Twelve healthy participants underwent gait assessments by two raters in two laboratories at different institutions. Identical protocols were used to collect five walking trials per participant. Discrete data were examined for knee joint angles and moments, gait speed, and stride length. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standardized error of the measurement (SEM), minimum detectable difference (MDD), and Bland and Altman plots. All spatiotemporal, joint angle, and joint moment measures had ICCs = 0.83-0.94, except for the knee adduction moment peak in late stance (ICC = 0.69 and 0.72). The knee adduction moment SEMs indicate that measurement errors due to the laboratory effect are between 0.19% and 0.31% body weight times height (0.03-0.05 Nm/kg). Meanwhile, measurement error for the knee flexion-extension angle is <2°. Our results are similar to previous test-retest reliability results from a single laboratory, and multiple laboratories, while adding previously unreported reliability metrics necessary for interpreting multi-centre study results.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite the morphological and musculoskeletal asymmetry resulting from unilateral limb loss, the mediolateral ground-reaction-impulse (GRI) should be counterbalanced between the affected and unaffected limbs during straight-ahead walking. Therefore, we investigated the strategies of mediolateral ground-reaction-force (GRF) generation adopted by UAK prosthesis users walking along a straight path. GRFs of 15 participants with UAK amputation were measured during straight-ahead walking. Then, the mediolateral GRI, stance time, and mean mediolateral GRF during the stance phase of the affected and unaffected limbs were compared. To better understand the GRF generation strategy, statistical-parametric-mapping (SPM) was applied to assess the phase-dependent difference of the mediolateral GRFs between two limbs. The results showed that UAK prosthesis users can achieve symmetric mediolateral GRI during straight-ahead walking by adopting an asymmetric gait strategy: shorter stance time and higher mean mediolateral GRF over the stance phase for the affected than for the unaffected limb. In addition, the analysis using SPM revealed that the affected limb generates a higher mean medial GRF component than the unaffected limb, especially during the single-support phase. Thus, a higher medial GRF during the single-support phase of the affected limb may allow UAK prosthesis users to achieve mediolateral GRI that are similar to those of the unaffected limb. Further insights on these mechanics may serve as guidelines on the improved design of prosthetic devices and the rehabilitation needs of UAK prosthesis users.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Timing of reactive step initiation, execution, and termination have been frequently reported to characterize reactive balance control. However, the test-retest reliabilities of these measures are unknown. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine the between- and within-session test-retest reliabilities of various force plate-derived measures of reactive stepping. Nineteen young, healthy adults responded to 6 small (~8-10% of body weight) and 6 large perturbations (~13-15% of body weight) using an anterior lean-and-release system. Tests were conducted during two visits separated by at least two days. Participants were instructed to recover balance in as few steps as possible. Step onset, foot-off, swing, and restabilization times were extracted from force plates. Relative test-retest reliability was determined through intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Absolute test-retest reliability was assessed using the standard error of the measurement (SEM). Foot-off and swing times had the highest between- and within-session test-retest reliabilities regardless of perturbation size (between-session ICC = 0.898-0.942; within-session ICC = 0.455-0.753). Conversely, step onset and restabilization times had lower ICCs and wider CIs (between-session ICC = 0.495-0.825; within-session ICC = -0.040-0.174). Between-session test-retest reliability was higher (ICC = 0.495-0.942) for all measures than within-session test-retest reliability (ICC = -0.040-0.753). Time to restabilization had the highest SEM, indicating the worst absolute reliability of the measures. These findings suggest multiple baseline sessions are needed for measuring restabilization and step onset times. The minimal detectable changes reported provide an index for measuring meaningful change due to an intervention.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to investigate transverse shank and frontal rearfoot coordination patterns and variability when running with normal foot and flatfoot. Participants with normal foot (n = 13) and flatfoot (n = 13) were asked to run at their preferred speed. The coupling angle between the shank and rearfoot, representing intersegmental coordination, was calculated using the modified vector coding technique and categorized into four coordination patterns. Standard deviation of the coupling angle was computed as a measure of coordination variability during the stance phase. No differences in the characteristics and spatiotemporal parameters between groups were found, and all participants had rearfoot strike pattern. During midstance, the flatfoot group showed a significantly greater proportion of anti-phase with proximal (shank) dominancy than the normal foot group (p = 0.04, effect size = 0.88 [large]). Furthermore, flatfoot group showed a significantly greater in variability than the normal foot group (p = 0.03, effect size = 0.91 [large]). This study's results may help explain why flatfoot is likely to result in PFPS. However, the occurrence mechanism of running injuries like PFPS is multi- factorial. Since these results alone are not sufficient to explain the cause-effect relationship between flatfoot and injuries like PFPS, a prospective study including other factors such as patellofemoral joint stress would also be needed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For this purpose, a group of 26 men with previous history of lateral ankle sprain (ASG) and a control group (CG) of 29 healthy counter-parts participated in this study. Tone, stiffness, elasticity and mechanical stress relaxation time were measured using a myotonometer in a single session. Higher tone was noted for TA and GL in ASG as compared to CG (effect size of Cohen's d = 0.57 [p = 0.04] and 0.59 [p = 0.04], respectively). Further, stiffness was higher in ASG than in CG for TA (d = 0.56; p = 0.04), PL (d = 0.58; p = 0.04) and GL (d = 0.63; p = 0.02).

There were no significant differences between groups in elasticity (p > 0.05). GM experienced no significant changes after ankle sprain in any of the variables (p > 0.05). To conclude, previous history of lateral ankle sprain results in higher TA and GL muscle tone. Likewise, these muscles in addition to PL exhibit less deformation against resistance due to their increased stiffness, thus needing a shorter time to restore to their original shape after deformation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite improvements that preserve the biological conditions for bone healing, there are concerns standard locked plating constructs may be overly stiff. Biphasic plating is a novel concept designed to provide suitable fracture motion and increased implant strength to support early full weight-bearing. This study aims to demonstrate that the Biphasic Plate can be incorporated into a pre-contoured distal femur plate while providing adequate flexibility and increased implant strength. The mechanical performance of the Biphasic Plate (BP) was investigated in comparison to a standard locking plate for the distal femur (LCP-DF). Constructs were formed by mounting the implants on a bone substitute. The construct stiffness and strength under axial loading and the magnitude of interfragmentary movement were determined using finite element analysis. The Biphasic Plate exhibited a bi-linear stiffness response; at low loads, the BP construct was 55% more compliant and at high loads 476% stiffer than the LCP-DF. The Biphasic Plate provided more consistent interfragmentary movement over a wider loading range. At partial weight-bearing loads, the Biphasic Plate produced larger interfragmentary movements (0.18 vs. 0.04 mm). However, at loads equivalent to full weight-bearing, the maximum movements were substantially smaller than the LCP-DF construct (1.5 vs. 3.5 mm). The increased flexibility at low loads was provided without sacrificing implant strength with peak stress in the Biphasic Plate 63% lower than the LCP-DF construct. The biphasic plating concept can be successfully incorporated into anatomically contoured distal femur plates while providing adequate flexibility and increasing implant strength.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone in children and young adults, while bone is a common site of metastasis for tumors initiating from other tissues. The heterogeneity, continual evolution, and complexity of this disease at different stages of tumor progression drives a critical need for physiologically relevant models that capture the dynamic cancer microenvironment and advance chemotherapy techniques. Monolayer cultures have been favored for cell-based research for decades due to their simplicity and scalability. However, the nature of these models makes it impossible to fully describe the biomechanical and biochemical cues present in 3-dimensional (3D) microenvironments, such as ECM stiffness, degradability, surface topography, and adhesivity. Biomaterials have emerged as valuable tools to model the behavior of various cancers by creating highly tunable 3D systems for studying neoplasm behavior, screening chemotherapeutic drugs, and developing novel treatment delivery techniques.

We compared the groups in terms of center of pressure (CoP) parameters (CoP velocity and amplitude, averaged across the duration of the 30-s trial), and the transient characteristics of the corresponding parameters, which were expressed as relative differences between the 1st and 2nd, and the 1st and 3rd 10-second interval within the trial (DIF_21 and DIF_31, respectively). Ballet dancers exhibited superior quiet stance postural control (2/5 parameters), as well as different transient behavior (3/5 parameters for DIF_21, and none for DIF_31). Specifically, the ballet dancers reduced body sway more during the 2nd interval, resulting in lower DIF_21 for CoP velocity (total and anterior-posterior) and CoP amplitude (medial-lateral) (effect size = 0.42-0.54). The correlations between individual CoP parameters and the corresponding DIF_21 and DIF_31 were very small or trivial (r < 0.15), suggesting that the outcomes pertaining to transient characteristic of body sway within the trial (specifically DIF_21) could represent additional information regarding the postural control during quiet stance. Future studies or even re-analyses of existing data are desired to reveal whether the measures of transient characteristics of body sway have any additional clinical utility compared to traditional whole-trial analyses.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One way to do this is by exploiting the mechanical benefit of arm swing which reduces whole-body rotation about the vertical axis and thus, minimizes the free vertical moment (FVM) that the foot applies to the ground. Humans appear to exploit these benefits of arm swing at speeds that are considered optimal, but we sought to determine if these benefits are conserved across slow to fast walking speeds. If true, arm swing may be a key feature that helps to minimize the net COT regardless of one's walking speed. We hypothesized that at all speeds, walking with arm swing would be less costly compared to walking without arm swing. As a secondary aim, we also explored if reductions in the peak FVM could explain the metabolic benefits of arm swing. Twenty-one young, healthy subjects walked with and without arm swing at speeds ranging from 0.50 to 2.00 m/s while we recorded metabolic, kinematic and kinetic data. At slow speeds (≤1.00 m/s), net COT was similar when walking with or without arm swing (p > 0.05). However, at intermediate and fast speeds (≥1.00 m/s), arm swing reduced the net COT by ~7-13% (all p's < 0.05). Additionally, peak FVM magnitudes decreased with arm swing, suggesting that it may partially explain the metabolic benefit of arm swing. Overall, we find that arm swing provides a net metabolic benefit during walking, but this benefit is constrained to intermediate and fast walking speeds.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), including balloon angioplasty and coronary stent deployment is a standard clinical invasive treatment for CAD. Coronary stents are delivered using a balloon catheter inserted across the lesion. The balloon is inflated to a nominal pressure, opening the occluded artery, deploying the stent and improving the flow of blood to the myocardium. All stent manufacturers have to perform standard in vitro mechanical testing under different physiological conditions. In this study, partially and fully bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) from Boston Scientific Limited have been examined in vitro and in silico for three different test methods: inflation, radial compression and crush resistance.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of age on the failure behavior of human knee meniscus when applying uniaxial tensile loads parallel or perpendicular to the primary circumferential fiber orientation. Two age groups were tested: under 40 and over 65 years old. We paired high-speed video with digital image correlation to quantify for the first time the planar strains occurring in the tear region at precise time points, including at ultimate tensile stress, when the tissue begins losing load-bearing capacity. On average, older meniscus specimens loaded parallel to the fiber axis had approximately one-third less ultimate tensile strain and absorbed 60% less energy to failure within the tear region than younger specimens (p < 0.05). Older specimens also had significantly reduced strength and material toughness when loaded perpendicular to the fibers (p < 0.05). These age-related changes indicate a loss of collagen fiber extensibility and weakening of the non-fibrous matrix with age. In addition, we found that when loaded perpendicular to the circumferential fibers, tears propagated near the planes of maximum tensile stress and strain. Whereas when loaded parallel to the circumferential fibers, tears propagated oblique to the loading axis, closer to the planes of maximum shear stress and strain. Our experimental results can assist the selection of valid failure criteria for meniscus, and provide insight into the effect of age on the failure mechanisms of soft fibrous tissue.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Currently, a key limitation of the experimental protocol and associated finite element (FE) models is that the exact load transfer, and consequently the loading conditions on the tibial plateau, is unknown. Often in FE models, load is applied to the tibial plateau based on inferences from micro-computed tomography (μCT). Experimental models often use a single strain gauge to assess the three-dimensional (3D) loading state. However, a single strain gauge is insufficient to validate such FE models. To address this challenge, we develop an experimentally calibrated method for identifying the load application region on the tibial plateau based upon measurements from three strain gauges. To achieve this, axial compression was conducted on mouse tibiae (n=3), with strains gauges on three surfaces. FE simulations were performed to compute the strains at the gauge locations as a function of a variable load location. By minimising the error between experimental and FE strains, the precise load location was identified; this was found to vary between tibia specimens. It was further shown that commonly used FE loading conditions, found in literature, did not replicate the experimental strain distribution, highlighting the importance of load calibration. This work provides critical insights into how load is transferred to the tibial plateau. Importantly, this work develops an experimentally informed technique for loading the tibial plateau in FE models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However clinical studies provide no information regarding the involvement of various soft tissues or how the mechanical environment affects revascularisation and bone healing. Here the results of experimental and numerical mechano-biological studies on fracture healing are summarized to provide guidance toward clinical treatment of fractures. In experimental studies, isolated muscle crush appeared to only temporarily impair fracture healing, with no significant effect to the final bone healing, whereas a more severe muscle trauma significantly reduced callus formation and biomechanical properties of the healed bones. An intraoperative trauma can furthermore impede vascularization. Surgical removal of the haematoma or periosteum disturbs fracture healing. While reaming for intramedullary nailing reduced blood flow in the bone during the early phase of bone healing, it did not affect the stiffness or strength of the final bone healing. The optimal conditions for rapid vascularization and bone healing result from fracture fixation that minimizes shearing movements in the healing zone while allowing moderate compressive movements. Bone healing is increasingly delayed with increasing fracture gap size and critical-size defects do not heal sufficiently independent of the mechanical environment. The stiffness of fracture fixation systems like nails and external fixators applied in clinical treatments frequently display a too low stiffness, whereas plate systems often cause a too stiff fixation that suppresses bone healing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, time-consuming procedures, such as the generation of high-quality FE meshes and setup of FE simulation, typically make the method impractical for rapid applications which could be used in clinical routine. Alternatively, discrete element analysis (DEA) has been developed to quantify mechanical conditions of the hip joint in a fraction of time compared to FEA. Although DEA has proven effective in the estimation of contact stresses and areas in various complex applications, it has not yet been well characterised by its ability to evaluate contact mechanics for the hip joint during gait cycle loading using data from several individuals. The objective of this work was to compare DEA modelling against well-established FEA for analysing contact mechanics of the hip joint during walking gait. Subject-specific models were generated from magnetic resonance images of the hip joints in five asymptomatic subjects. The DEA and FEA models were then simulated for 13 loading time-points extracted from a full gait cycle. Computationally, DEA was substantially more efficient compared to FEA (simulation times of seconds vs. hours). The DEA and FEA methods had similar predictions for contact pressure distribution for the hip joint during normal walking. In all 13 simulated loading time-points across five subjects, the maximum difference in average contact pressures between DEA and FEA was within ±0.06 MPa. Furthermore, the difference in contact area ratio computed using DEA and FEA was less than ±6%.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The fall rate for individuals post-stroke while turning is nearly four times as high compared to healthy adults, with most falls resulting in injury. Thus, there is a need for evidence-based rehabilitation targets to improve turning performance for individuals post-stroke. To produce well-coordinated movements, muscles can be organized into muscle modules (i.e., groups of co-excited muscles). Post-stroke these modules can be merged, leading to impaired muscle coordination and walking performance. However, the relationship between impaired coordination and turning performance is not well understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of impaired muscle coordination (i.e., merged modules) on turning performance (i.e., time and number of steps required to complete a turn, and smoothness and balance control during the turn). Individuals post-stroke and healthy controls performed three tasks including overground straight-line walking, a 90-degree turn, and a 180-degree turn. The number of muscle modules during straight-line walking were determined using non-negative matrix factorization. During 180-degree turning, those with two modules took longer to turn, used more steps and had less smooth movement. Those with reduced module complexity exhibited diminished balance control during both 90-degree and 180-degree turning. These results suggest obtaining independent modules should be an important aim in locomotor therapies aimed at improving turning performance. In addition, the time it takes to complete a 180-degree turn may provide useful clinical insight into impaired muscle coordination post-stroke.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A systematic review on the complexity of causes.,"Injury prevalence in dancers is high, and misaligned turnout (TO) is claimed to bear injury risk. This systematic review aimed to investigate if compensating or forcing TO leads to musculoskeletal injuries. A systematic literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA Guidelines using the databases of PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Academic Search Premier, and ScienceDirect. Studies investigating the relationship between compensated or forced TO and injuries in all genders, all ages, and levels of dancers were included. Details on misaligned TO measurements and injuries had to be provided. Screening was performed by two researchers, data extraction and methodological quality assessment executed by one researcher and checked by another. 7 studies with 1293 dancers were included. Methodological quality was low due to study designs and a general lack of standardised definition of pathology and methods of assessment of misaligned TO. The studies investigating the lower extremities showed a hip-focus only. Non-hip contributors as well as their natural anatomical variations were not accounted for, limiting the understanding of injury mechanisms underlying misaligned TO. As such no definite conclusions on the effect of compensating or forcing TO on musculoskeletal injuries could be made. Total TO is dependent on complex motion cycles rather than generalised (hip) joint dominance only. Objective dual assessment of maximum passive joint range of motion through 3D kinematic analysis in combination with physical examination is needed to account for anatomical variations, locate sites prone to (overuse)injury, and investigate underlying injury mechanisms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, we compared the non-amputated limb muscle coordination of eight unilateral transfemoral amputees to eight able-bodied controls. Inverse dynamics approach was conducted via a musculoskeletal model to obtain lower limb joint moments and muscle forces. In addition to the muscle forces at the instants of peak joint moments and the maximum muscle forces, the peak joint moments of the lower limbs were also investigated. The results showed that there were significant differences of muscle forces between the non-amputated limbs and the controls at the instant of peak hip extension moment, although the peak hip extension moments themselves were not significantly different between the two groups. The non-amputated limbs had significantly smaller peak hip flexion moment and peak knee extension moment, with significant differences between the muscle forces of non-amputated limbs and controls at the two instants. There was no significant difference between the muscle forces of the non-amputated limbs and controls at the peak knee flexion moment instant, despite the fact that the non-amputated limbs had significantly higher peak knee flexion moments. In addition, the non-amputated limbs had significantly smaller maximum muscle forces than the controls. These results demonstrate that amputees modify their muscle coordination to adapt to the specific joint requirements of the prosthetic gait.

These reductions in walking speeds are risk factors for negative health outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of an adaptive speed treadmill controller on walking speed and propulsive forces in older adults, including the mechanisms and strategies underlying any change in propulsive force between conditions. Seventeen participants completed two treadmill conditions, one with a fixed comfortable walking speed and one with an adaptive speed controller. The adaptive speed treadmill controller utilized a set of inertial-force, gait parameters, and position-based controllers that respond to an instantaneous anterior inertial force. A biomechanical-based model previously developed for individuals post-stroke was implemented for older adults to determine the primary gait parameters that contributed to the change in propulsive forces when increasing speed. Participants walked at faster average speeds during the adaptive speed controller (1.20 m/s) compared to the fixed speed controller conditions (0.98 m/s); however, these speeds were not as fast as their overground speed (1.44 m/s). Although average trailing limb angle (TLA) (p < 0.001) and ankle moment (p = 0.020) increased when speed also increased between treadmill conditions, increasing TLA contributed more to the increased propulsive forces seen during faster treadmill speeds. Our findings show that older adults chose faster walking speeds and increased propulsive force when walking on an adaptive speed treadmill compared to a fixed speed treadmill, suggesting that an adaptive speed treadmill controller has the potential to be a beneficial alternative to current exercise interventions for older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A recently validated individualized linear model approach that estimates scapular orientation based on measurable humerothoracic orientation has yet to be adapted for pitching and may improve upon currently recommended methods such as the acromion marker cluster (AMC). This study evaluates the ability of a pitching-specific individualized linear model to estimate scapular orientation in static positions throughout a throwing motion by comparing against palpation and an AMC. Individualized linear models were created for 14 collegiate pitchers by determining scapulothoracic and humerothoracic orientations at static arm postures throughout their individual dynamic throwing motions. Linear model and AMC estimates were compared against palpation at intermediate test positions within the throwing motion that were excluded from model creation. Linear model estimates were similar to palpation at all test positions and on all scapulothoracic axes while AMC estimates differed on internal/external rotation and anterior/posterior tilt during cocking (p = 0.001, p = 0.018) and follow-through (p = 0.003, p = 0.006). Linear model root mean square error (RMSE) values were smaller than AMC values for all positions/axes. Linear model RMSE values (2.8-6.3°) were within a range of published values previously deemed acceptable, while AMC values (5.1-15.8°) went beyond this range. The linear model approach accurately estimates static scapular orientation throughout a pitching motion and improves upon current methods. Future applications to dynamic pitching may facilitate understanding of how scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint function relate to injury risks, rehabilitation, and performance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using multiple steps to recover balance is consistently associated with increased fall risk, altered body center of mass (CoM) control and instability. The aim of this study was to compare the spatio-temporal stepping characteristics and the margin of stability (MoS) of single lateral sidesteps (LSS1) with the first and second steps of a two-step protective step sequence. Two-step sequences begin with either a cross-over step to the front or back, or a medial step followed by a lateral sidestep. Seventy-one older adults received random lateral waist-pull perturbations to either side. We hypothesized that LSS1 would be more stable (larger MoS) than either step in a two-step sequence. With some exceptions, utilizing a two-step sequence was associated with a reduced CoM velocity and distance between the base of support and CoM and decreased stability in the frontal plane following limb loading of the first and second step. There were no differences in the time available to arrest the extrapolated CoM at the end of a single lateral sidestep or the final step of a two-step sequence. Two-step sequences involving a cross-over step include more complex stepping trajectories and also challeng stability in the sagittal plane requiring a multidimensional balance correction. These results indicate important step type differences in center of mass control in recovering balance with a single lateral sidestep as opposed to a two-step sequence among older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Despite widespread, their reported accuracy in nominal working conditions shows a variability of several orders of magnitude, ranging from few microns to several millimetres. No clear explanation for this variability has been provided yet. We hypothesized that this reflects an error affecting OSS outcomes when some of the tracked markers are totally or partially occluded. The aim of this paper is to quantify this error in static and dynamic conditions, also distinguishing between total and partial marker occlusion. A Vicon system featuring 8 cameras is employed in this study. Two camera distributions, one designed to maximize OSS accuracy and another one representative of a typical gait setup, are investigated. For both the setups, static and dynamic tests are performed, evaluating the different impact of partial and total marker occlusions. Marker occlusions significantly affected the system performances. The maximum measure variation reached 1.86 mm and 7.20 mm in static and dynamic conditions, respectively, both obtained in the case of partial occlusion. This systematic source of error is likely to affect gait measures: markers placed on the patient body are often visible only by half of the cameras, with swinging arms and legs providing moving occlusions. The maximum error observed in this study can potentially affect the kinematics outcomes of conventional gait models, particularly on frontal and coronal plane, and consequently the peak muscle forces estimated with musculoskeletal models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Histological and bulk mechanical studies have identified extracellular matrix components that correlate with superior failure strength, but it is unclear how local changes in geometry and composition at the repair interface affect tissue strains under physiologic loading. Here, we investigated the effects of local compositional and interface geometry on lateral cartilage repair integration by coupling microscale Raman spectroscopy and confocal elastography to measure tissue strains under compressive and shear loading. Histological integration assessments did not have significant relationships with interface strains under compressive loading (p > 0.083) and only the perimeter attachment score was trending towards statistical significance with the |Exy| strain tensor under shear loading (p = 0.050). Interface slope had a stronger correlation with local tissue strains under compressive and shear loading compared to compositional measures of GAG, collagen, or proteins (compressive loading |Eyy| tensor: R2 = 0.400 (interface slope), 0.005 (GAG), 0.024 (collagen), and 0.012 (protein); shear loading |Exy| tensor: R2 = 0.457 (interface slope), 0.003 (GAG), 0.006 (collagen), and 0.000 (total protein)). These data support surgical publications detailing the need for vertical walls when debriding chondral defects. Current histological integration assessments and local compositional measures were insufficient for identifying the variation in interface strains under compressive and shear loading. Thus, our data points to the importance of controlling interface geometry at the time of surgery, which has implications for cartilage repair integration and long-term healing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Mevea simulation software has been utilized for this purpose, which is a novel application of this software in the field of biomechanics. The model of the human skeleton was created in Mevea using the graphics built in 3ds Max. Simulink external interface for Mevea was established. Simulink acts as a connection between the Mevea software and Kinect for controlling the model. The developed model has been tested through three case studies involving the elbow joint, thoracic joint, and full body. Changes in torque and angular position of joints based on the input of joints are presented as graphs. The developed real-time model of the human skeleton in Mevea can execute the real-time simulation of a person's movements in front of a motion capture camera and provide the changes of torques, which are dependent on the angular positions of the body joints. This work provides the possibility to use the developed real-time model for physiotherapeutic rehabilitation to identify problematic muscles based on produced torque of the joints in order to specify the therapeutic options.

It has recently been demonstrated that the magnitude and orientation of principal moments of inertia are crucial for accurate dynamic models. This is important to consider given that the orientation of principal axes is fixed for the majority of geometric and regression body models. This paper quantifies the effect of subject specific geometry on the magnitude and orientation of second moments of volume in the trunk segment. The torsos of 40 male participants were scanned using a 3D imaging system and the magnitude and orientation of principal moments of volume were calculated from the resulting geometry. Principal axes are not aligned with the segment co-ordinate system in the torso segment, with mean Euler angles of 11.7, 1.9 and 10.3 in the ZXY convention. Researchers using anatomical modelling techniques should try and account for subject specific geometry and the mis-alignment of principal axes. This will help to reduce errors in simulation by mitigating the effect of errors in magnitude of principal moments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Excessive transchondral strain can damage the solid matrix and ultimately lead to osteoarthritis. Currently, high-resolution transchondral strain distribution is unknown in the human hip. Thus, knowledge of transchondral strain patterns is of fundamental importance to interpreting the patterns of injury that occur in prearthritic hip joints. This study had three main objectives. We sought to 1) quantify high-resolution transchondral strain in the native human hip, 2) determine differences in transchondral strain between static and dynamic loading conditions to better understand recovery and repressurization of cartilage in the hip, and 3) create finite element (FE) models of the experimental testing to validate a modeling framework for future analysis. The transchondral strain patterns found in this study provide insight on the localization of strain within cartilage of the hip. Most notably, the chondrolabral junction experienced high tensile and shear strain across all samples, which explains clinical data reporting it as the most common region of damage in cartilage of the hip. Further, the representative FE framework was able to match the experimental static results and predict the dynamic results with very good agreement. This agreement provides confidence for both experimental and computational measurement methods and demonstrates that the specific anisotropic biphasic FE framework used in this study can both describe and predict the experimental results.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies have suggested that body configuration during the impact plays an important role in a hip fracture. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of body configuration angles (trunk tilt angle, trunk flexion angle, femur horizontal rotation angle, and femur diaphysis angle) on low-energy acetabular fractures via a parametric analysis. A computed tomography-based (CT) finite element model of the ground-proximal femur-pelvis complex was created, and strain magnitude, time-history response, and distribution within the acetabulum were evaluated. Results showed that while the trunk tilt angle and femur diaphysis angle have the greatest effect on strain magnitude, the direction of the fall (lateral vs. posterolateral) contributes to strain distribution within the acetabulum. The results also suggest that strain level and distribution within the proximal femur and acetabulum resulting from a sideways fall are not similar and, in some cases, even opposite. Taken together, our simulations suggest that a more horizontal trunk and femoral shaft at the impact phase can increase the risk of low-energy acetabular fractures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The torque-time signal was recorded for the plantaflexor muscles in fifteen men and the peak value of RTD was obtained. Tendon stiffness (kT) and muscle stiffness (kM) of the Gastrocnemius Medialis (GM) were assessed during maximal isometric voluntary contractions (MVC) and quick release using ultrafast ultrasound (1000 Hz). During the explosive contraction, the GM geometrical changes were recorded and the belly gearing (belly velocity/fascicle velocity) was calculated. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between variables, whereas equality of correlation coefficients between RTD and kT and kM was tested by means of the Hotelling's statistics. During explosive contraction, kT was higher than kM (~55 and ~30 N⋅mm-1, respectively). RTD positively correlated with kM (r = 0.75, p < 0.001), kT (r = 0.58, p = 0.044) and belly gearing (r = 0.78, p < 0.001). However, Hotelling's test showed no significant differences between the correlation coefficients between RTD and muscle and tendon stiffness. Further, belly gearing was significantly positively correlated with kM only (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). Our data suggest that muscle and tendon stiffness are similarly associated with RTD. Given the association with belly gearing, muscle stiffness seems to play an important role in determining the muscle length changes, thereby affecting the muscle force transmission capacity during the transient phases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the outcome of those models is sensitive to the material model and material properties chosen for ligaments, the collagen reinforced tissues connecting bone to bone. The purpose of this study was to investigate different compositionally motivated material models and further to develop a model that can accurately reproduce experimentally measured stress-relaxation data of bovine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Tensile testing samples were extracted from ACLs of bovine knee joints (N = 10) and subjected to a three-step stress-relaxation test at the toe region. Data from the experiments was averaged and one average finite element model was generated to replicate the experiment. Poroelastic and different fibril-reinforced poro(visco)elastic material models were applied, and their material parameters were optimized to reproduce the experimental force-time response. Material models with only fluid flow mediated relaxation were not able to capture the stress-relaxation behavior (R2 = 0.806, 0.803 and 0.938). The inclusion of the viscoelasticity of the fibrillar network improved the model prediction (R2 = 0.978 and 0.976), but the complex stress-relaxation behavior was best captured by a poroelastic model with a nonlinear two-relaxation-time strain-recruited viscoelastic fibrillar network (R2 = 0.997). The results suggest that in order to replicate the multi-step stress-relaxation behavior of ACL in tension, the fibrillar network formulation should include the complex nonlinear viscoelastic phenomena.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Prerequisites for quantifying such symmetries include knowledge of the gait and gait events, such as hoof to ground contact patterns over consecutive strides. Extracting this information in a robust and reliable way is essential to accurately calculate many kinematic variables commonly used in the field. In this study, optical motion capture was used to measure 222 horses of various breeds, performing a total of 82 664 steps in walk and trot under different conditions, including soft, hard and treadmill surfaces as well as moving on a straight line and in circles. Features were extracted from the pelvis and withers vertical movement and from pelvic rotations. The features were then used in a quadratic discriminant analysis to classify gait and to detect if the left/right hind limb was in contact with the ground on a step by step basis. The predictive model achieved 99.98% accuracy on the test data of 120 horses and 21 845 steps, all measured under clinical conditions. One of the benefits of the proposed method is that it does not require the use of limb kinematics making it especially suited for clinical applications where ease of use and minimal error intervention are a priority.

Treatment of fractures of the proximal humerus has the intra-operative risk of articular damage when inserting multiple screws. Distal-varus collapse of the head is a frequent complication in osteoporotic patients. The aim of this biomechanical study was to investigate if an Innovative-cement-technique (the screws are replaced by injection of cement) provides the same or better stability of the reconstructed head compared to the Standard-technique (locking screws). A four-fragment fracture was simulated in twelve pairs of humeri, with removal of part of the cancellous bone to simulate osteoporotic ""eggshell"" defect. One humerus of each pair was repaired either with a Standard-technique (locking plate, 2 cortical and 6 locking screws), or with the Innovative-cement-technique (injection of a partially-resorbable reinforced bone substitute consisting of PMMA additivated with 26% beta-TCP). Cement injection was performed both in the lab and under fluoroscopic monitoring. The reconstructed specimens were tested to failure with a cyclic force of increasing amplitude. The Innovative-cement-technique withstood a force 3.57 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions before failure started. The maximum force before final collapse for the Innovative-cement-technique was 3.56 times larger than the contralateral Standard-technique. These differences were statistically significant. The Innovative-cement-technique, based on the reinforced bone substitute, demonstrated better biomechanical properties compared to the Standard-technique. These findings, along with the advantage of avoiding the possible complications associated with the locking screws, may help safer and more effective treatment in case of osteoporotic multi-fragment humeral fractures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In mouse models of post-traumatic OA (ptOA), the pathogenesis of disease is notably impacted by sex (often worse in males) and injury model (e.g. meniscal versus ligament injury). Increasing ptOA progression and severity is often associated with greater relative instability of the joint but few studies have directly quantified changes in joint mechanics after injury and compared outcomes across multiple models in both male and female mice. Passive anterior-posterior knee biomechanics were evaluated in 10-week-old, male and female C57BL/6J mice. PtOA injury models included destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM), anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) or mechanical rupture (ACLR), and combined DMM and ACLT (DMM + ACLT). Sham operated and non-operated controls (NOC) were included for baseline comparisons.

Measures of joint laxity (range of motion, neutral zone) and stiffness were calculated. Joint laxity was comparable between male and female mice while joint stiffness was greater in females (P ≤ 0.002, correcting for body-mass and injury-model). Anterior-posterior joint mechanics were minimally altered by DMM but significantly affected by loss of the ACL (P < 0.001), with equivalent changes between ACL-injury models despite different injury mechanisms and adjacent meniscal damage. These findings suggest that despite the important role of joint injury; sex- and model-specific differences in ptOA progression and severity are not primarily driven by altered anterior-posterior knee biomechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We characterized trunk control in response to different step widths using a novel feedback system and examined the different effects of wide and narrow step widths as they each present unique task demands. Twenty healthy young adults walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s at five prescribed step widths: 0.33, 1.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67 times preferred step width. Motion capture was used to record trunk kinematics, and surface electromyography was used to record longissimus muscle activation bilaterally. Vector coding was used to analyze coordination between pelvis and thorax segments of the trunk. Results showed that while center of mass only varied across step width in the mediolateral direction, trunk kinematics in all three planes were affected by changes in step width. Angular excursions of the trunk segments increased only with wider widths in the transverse plane. Thorax-pelvis kinematic coordination was affected more by wider widths in transverse plane and by narrower widths in the frontal plane. Peak longissimus activation and bilateral co-activation increased as step widths became narrower. As a control task, walking with varied step widths is not simply a continuum of adjustments from narrow to wide. Rather, narrowing step width and widening step width from the preferred width represent distinct control challenges that are managed in different ways.

The most prescribed mobility aid, the walking cane, is often underloaded and therefore fails to reduce knee joint loading and provide symptomatic relief. For this study, a novel walking cane with haptic biofeedback was designed to improve cane loading and reduce the knee adduction moment (KAM). To determine; 1) the short-term efficacy of a novel walking cane using haptic biofeedback to encourage proper cane loading and 2) the effects of the novel cane on KAM. Cane loading and KAM, peak knee adduction moment (PKAM), and knee adduction angular impulse (KAAI)) while walking were calculated under five conditions: 1) naïve, 2A) after scale training (apply 20%BW to cane while standing, using a beam scale), 2B) scale recall (attempt to load the cane to 20%BW), 3A) after haptic training (vibrotactile biofeedback delivered when target cane load achieved), and 3B) haptic recall (attempt to load the cane to 20%BW with vibrotactile biofeedback delivered). Compared to the naïve condition all interventions significantly increased cane loading and reduced PKAM and KAAI. No differences between haptic recall and scale recall condition were observed. The haptic biofeedback cane was shown to be an effective and simple way to increase cane loading and reduced knee loading. Haptic biofeedback and scale training were equally effective at producing immediate short-term improvements in cane loading and knee loading. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of scale training and canes with haptic biofeedback on knee joint health, pain, and osteoarthritis disease progression.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unfortunately, biomechanical data describing trunk muscle activation and intervertebral load, which can contribute to understanding the pathomechanics of the AIS spine, cannot be measured in vivo due to the invasiveness of the procedures. The present study provides the biomechanical characterization of the spinal loads in scoliotic subjects by exploiting musculoskeletal modelling approach, allowing for calculating biomechanical measures in an assigned posture. A spine model with articulated ribcage previously developed in AnyBody software was applied. The predicted outcomes were evaluated in the upright posture, depending on scoliosis severity and curve type, in a population of 132 scoliotic subjects with mild, moderate, and severe scoliosis. Radiographic-based three dimensional reconstruction of vertebral orientations and scaling of body segments and trunk muscle cross-section area guaranteed geometrical subject-specificity. Validation analysis supporting the application of the model was performed. Trunk muscles were found more activated in the convex side of the scoliotic curve, in agreement with reference in vivo measurements, with progressive increase with scoliosis severity. The intervertebral lateral shear was found positively correlated with the severity of the scoliosis, demonstrating that the transferred load is not a priori orthogonal to vertebral endplate in the frontal plane, and thus questioning the assumption of the 'follower load' approach in case of experimental or computational study on the scoliotic spine.

This study investigated the relationship between angular velocity and RTD scaled to Tmax. In 17 participants, tetanic contractions (100-Hz) of the knee extensors were evoked as the knee was passively extended at different iso-velocities between 0° s-1 and 200° s-1. Each condition consisted of evoking 0.25-s contractions without pre-activation (for measuring RTD) commencing as the knee passed 95° of extension, and 1.25-s contractions with pre-activation (for measuring Tmax), commencing 1 s prior to the knee reaching 95°. Torque at 100 ms after torque onset (T100) and peak RTD (RTDpeak) in the contractions without pre-activation were normalised to Tmax. The torque-velocity relationship for T100 was flat in comparison to an inverse, curvilinear relationship for Tmax, resulting in linear increases in normalised T100 and RTDpeak with increased velocity. Results also showed normalised T100 and RTDpeak were likely overestimated due to shortening-induced force depression (FD) which would be greater in contractions with- than without- pre-activation. However, these effects of FD cannot explain the faster normalised RTD with increased velocity, as the relative difference in work done (a proxy for FD) between contractions with and without pre-activation decreased - and thus the overestimation of normalised RTD metrics likely decreased - with increased velocity. In conclusion, RTD scaled to Tmax increases with increased velocity, which appears to be an intrinsic contractile property independent of the effects of force depression.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Simulating the effect of treatments can help the patient and the treating physician to understand the effects and impact of the intervention. To simulate deformations of the tongue, identifying accurate mechanical properties of tissue is essential. However, not many succeeded in characterizing in-vivo tongue stiffness. Those who did, measured the tongue At Rest (AR), in which muscle tone subsides even if muscles are not willingly activated. We expected to find an absolute rest state in participants 'under General Anesthesia' (GA). We elaborated on previous work by measuring the mechanical behavior of the in-vivo tongue under aspiration using an improved volume-based method. Using this technique, 5 to 7 measurements were performed on 10 participants both AR and under GA. The obtained Pressure-Shape curves were first analyzed using the initial slope and its variations. Hereafter, an inverse Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was applied to identify the mechanical parameters using the Yeoh, Gent, and Ogden hyperelastic models. The measurements AR provided a mean Young's Modulus of 1638 Pa (min 1035 - max 2019) using the Yeoh constitutive model, which is in line with previous ex-vivo measurements. However, while hoping to find a rest state under GA, the tongue unexpectedly appeared to be approximately 2 to 2.5 times stiffer under GA than AR. Explanations for this were sought by examining drugs administered during GA, blood flow, perfusion, and upper airway reflexes, but neither of these explanations could be confirmed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Speculatively, these changes may be observed more readily when the force-time signal is differentiated, yielding the yank-time signal. However, the differentiation process, including the signal filtering used before or after differentiation, can significantly affect the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and likelihood of meaningful inference. The aim of the present study was to compare three methods of deriving the yank-time signal: Method 1 derived the yank-time signal using 2nd-order central differentiation subsequent to application of a 4th-order Butterworth filter; Method 2 included the same process as Method 1 but additionally filtered the yank-time data with a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter; and Method 3 directly and simultaneously derived and smoothed the yank-time signal using a Savitzky-Golay digital differentiation filter. The current analyses revealed Method 2 had the best SNR, followed by Methods 3 and 1, but caused a small loss of signal amplitude. With regards to timing of inflection points in the yank-time data, no significant difference was observed. Therefore, Method 3 led to the best derivation of the yank-time signal due to its efficiency and preservation of signal characteristics and good SNR. Also, a strong association between the first maximum point of the yank-time signal and the start of the downward movement of the body's centre of mass during a countermovement jump, as identified by 3-D motion analysis, was observed. Thus, subtle events (e.g. start of downward movement) can be easily observed in the yank-time signal.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the human trunk naturally sways during still standing, which potentially alters the targeted parameters. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of postural sway on lumbo-pelvic parameters during still standing at different arm positions. A non-radiological back measurement device was used to determine the absolute changes of back lordosis and sacral orientation during one-minute still standing while participants (10 males and 10 females without low back pain) held their arms at eight different positions. When the arms were freely hanging down at both sides, males displayed median values of 25.2° (range: 15.6-45.0°) and 7.4° (range: 2.0-26.7°) for back lordosis and sacral orientation, which were smaller than those of 33.1° (range: 11.9-41.9°) and 16.1° (range: 0.8-22.8°) for females, respectively (P < 0.05). At the same arm position, the median values were 2.7° (range: 1.3-5.2°) and 2.9° (range: 1.6-4.5°) for change of back lordosis and change of sacral orientation, respectively. Sex displayed no significant influence for both measures. Different arm positions non-significantly affected the change of back lordosis. When hands rested on horizontal bars, the change of sacral orientation was significantly less than during other arm positions (P < 0.05). Hence, back lordosis and sacral orientation inherently change during still standing, independently of sex and arm position, which could compromise the reliability of measurements at a single time point. When categorizing subjects into groups with normal or abnormal lumbo-pelvic balance, this variability should be taken into consideration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This unique shape, and the natural variations therein, have previously been analysed using a range of methods; from visual assessments, anthropometric measurements, and footprints, to x-ray, ultrasound and magnetic resonance images. However, these methods are often limited by their use of linear two-dimensional measures. Only recently have advances in three-dimensional (3D) scanning technology and statistical shape analysis been applied to studying 3D foot shape variations. Given their novelty, information regarding the reliability and repeatability of 3D foot scanning and shape modelling is lacking. To investigate whether repeated foot scans captured by two examiners give the same 3D shape and produce consistent statistical shape models, 17 healthy adults' left feet were scanned while bearing half and full bodyweight, as well as minimal weight. Surface to surface distances between corresponding foot meshes and differences between shape model quality criteria were both found to be small and insignificant. The only exception being the specificity criterion for minimally loaded foot scans. Furthermore, Euclidean vectors were used to model the magnitude and direction of deformation that feet undergo as a consequence of increased loading. The deformation models showed that loading a minimally loaded foot results in greater, but less consistent, shape changes than when increasing the load on an already loaded foot. These results show that the utilized methods offer a valuable, reliable and repeatable approach to analysing foot shape and deformation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Slotted nails allow a connection to a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) stem. This study aims to compare implant and construct stiffness, interfragmentary movement and cycles to failure between an antegrade slotted femoral nail construct docked to a TKA stem and a distal femoral locking plate in a human periprosthetic femoral fracture model. In eight pairs of fresh-frozen human femora with stalked TKA, a 10 mm transverse osteotomy gap was set simulating a Rorabeck type II, Su type I fracture. The femora were pairwise instrumented with either an antegrade slotted nail coupled to the prosthesis stem, or a locking plate. Cyclic testing with a progressively increasing physiologic loading profile was performed at 2 Hz until catastrophic construct failure. Relative movement at the osteotomy site was monitored by means of optical motion tracking. In addition, four-point bending implant stiffness, torsional implant stiffness and frictional fit of the stem-nail connection were investigated via separate non-destructive tests. Intramedullary nails exhibited significantly higher four-point bending and significantly lower torsional implant stiffness than plates, P < 0.01. Increasing difference between nail and stem diameters decreased frictional fit at the stem-nail junction. Nail constructs provided significantly higher initial axial bending stiffness and cycles to failure (200 ± 83 N/mm; 16'871 ± 5'227) compared to plate constructs (93 ± 35 N/mm; 7'562 ± 1'064), P = 0.01. Relative axial translation at osteotomy level after 2'500 cycles was significantly smaller for nail fixation (0.14 ± 0.11 mm) compared with plate fixation (0.99 ± 0.20 mm), P < 0.01.

Post-hoc investigations for in vivo loading and in vitro experiments have been developed to better understand microdamage formation. In this context, previous studies were not able to discriminate the effects caused by structural changes of the trabecular network from differences of tissue/material properties on microdamage formation. In the present study a fatigue test protocol was established to induce microdamage at a defined tensile stress state of individual trabeculae. Further, a thorough analysis of microdamage analysis was presented for 2D and 3D confocal images, enabling a comparison between the tissue and the meso-scale. Eight individual trabeculae were tested for 1500 cycles, six for 2100 cycles and seven for 3000 cycles (close to failure). Microdamage increased slowly from 1500 to 2100 cycles and showed a rapid increase at 3000 cycles. Diffuse damage was mainly present, although also linear microcracks were visible at 2100 and 3000 cycles. Average microcrack length was 93 µm and diffuse damage density was 4.4% for samples tested for 3000 cycles, comparable to previous studies on trabecular bone cores. Only one to three large microdamage sites were observed in the central region, connected to the trabecular surface with small straight cracks.

Due to its influence on microtubule stability, we and others have hypothesized that paclitaxel alters neuromechanical properties. A prior study suggested that paclitaxel increases the tensile moduli of rat sensory nerves. However, the effects of paclitaxel on tissue level viscoelasticity have not been tested. In this study, sural branches of C57BL/6J mouse sciatic nerves were bilaterally excised. One nerve was treated with Ringer's solution containing paclitaxel, and the contralateral nerve with Ringer's alone. Nerves were then subject to a passive loading protocol in which peak stress, relaxed stress, and stress-relaxation dynamics were monitored at increasing strain. Elastic and tangent tensile moduli were calculated from both peak and relaxed stress-strain curves as well as failure stress were significantly elevated in paclitaxel-treated nerves compared to controls. Double-exponential fits (with τm and τn indicating fast and slow time constants, respectively) were successfully applied to model stress-relaxation. Though no significant differences in the τm and τn were found between groups, paclitaxel treatment significantly increased the variability of τm, suggesting heterogeneous effects on nerve biomechanical properties. Our data establish that paclitaxel effects at the cellular level influence tensile viscoelastic properties of nerves at the tissue level. These results have implications for understanding biomechanical influences on the progression and physical rehabilitation of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recent advances in estimation techniques using wearable sensors for kinematic analysis and sports performance could enable estimation outside the laboratory. This paper proposes a state-input-parameter estimation framework to continuously estimate the vertical ground reaction force waveform during running. By modeling a runner as a single degree of freedom mass-spring-damper with acceleration measurements at the sacrum a state-space formulation can be applied using Newtonian methods. A dual-Kalman filter is employed to estimate the unmeasured system input which feeds through to an unscented Kalman filter to estimate system dynamics and unknown model parameters (e.g. spring stiffness). For validation, 14 subjects performed three one-minute running trials at three different speeds (self-selected slow, comfortable, and fast) on a pressure-sensor-instrumented treadmill. The estimated vertical ground reaction force waveform parameters; peak vertical ground reaction force (RMSE=6.1-7.2%,ρ=0.95-0.97), vertical impulse (RMSE=8.5-13.0%,ρ=0.50-0.60), loading rate (RMSE=24.6-39.4%,ρ=0.85-0.93), and cadence RMSE<1%,ρ=1.00 were compared against the instrumented treadmill measurements. The proposed state-input-parameter estimation framework could monitor personalized vertical ground reaction force metrics for potential biofeedback applications. The feedback mechanism could provide information about the vertical ground reaction force characteristics to the runner as they are running to provide knowledge of both desirable and undesirable loading characteristics experienced.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A better understanding of the biomechanical contributions of the PCL to knee stability under physiologic, clinically-relevant loading conditions could improve reconstruction techniques and outcomes. We employed a servohydraulic joint motion simulator to investigate the kinematics of intact and PCL-deficient knees during simulated clinical tests and activities of daily living(ADL), including gait, stair ascent and descent. PCL transection caused the tibia to be displaced posterior, relative to the intact joint, throughout flexion. PCL transection also increased the amount of posterior tibial displacement measured during posterior laxity testing by up to 9.6 ± 1.7 mm at 75° (p = 0.001). During internal-external rotational laxity testing, PCL transection increased the allowable internal and external rotation of the tibia, by up to 2.9 ± 0.5°at90° (p = 0.001) and 1.0 ± 0.2° at45°(p = 0.001), respectively. PCL transection did not have a significant effect on abduction-adduction kinematics or laxity, regardless of flexion angle. PCL transection resulted in a relative posterior displacement of the tibia during the stance phase of gait when the knee was extended (2.2 ± 2.2 mm, p = 0.045), and when the knee was flexed during stair ascent (2.4 ± 2.2 mm, p = 0.035) and descent (1.6 ± 1.4 mm, p = 0.037).

We aimed to measure the mechanical load generated by movement of functional appliances and determine the factors influencing this load. Thirteen patients aged 8-12 years were selected for the study, and the load was measured using a previously developed measurement device. To investigate the factors affecting the load, the temporomandibular joint morphology and muscles related to the mandible were examined using cone-beam computed tomography. The standard regression coefficients of the factors affecting the load per millimeter of movement distance were 0.64 and 0.66 for (a) the inclination of the articular eminence and (b) the angle between occlusal plane and posterior temporalis, respectively. Measurement of the occlusal plane to the posterior temporalis and the inclination of the articular eminence were significantly different (p < 0.05). The angle of inclination of the articular eminence emerged as a strong influencing factor. Similarly, the influence of measurements from the occlusal plane to the posterior temporalis was considerable since the posterior temporalis muscle is the most active when the mandible is extended forward. We also found a possible relationship between the occlusal force and load at the construction bite position. To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the actual load associated with the angle of the temporalis muscle to the occlusal plane, inclination angle of the articular eminence, angle between the occlusal plane and the Frankfort plane, and the angle between the geniohyoid muscle and the occlusal plane.

Improving motor skills by incorporating sensory feedback in rehabilitation protocols for persons with lower limb amputation has been gaining traction over time. However, the control mechanisms involved in this regarding time-frequency analysis have not been investigated yet. The purpose of this study was to explore the frequencies/time-scales responsible for postural stability in trans-femoral amputees with vibrotactile feedback. Center of Pressure (COP) signals were collected from 5 trans-femoral amputees and 10 healthy subjects during weight shifting balance tasks. A customized foot insole was used to estimate the COP for actuation of vibratory feedback. The evaluation of postural sway fluctuations by means of COP excursions with vibrotactile feedback was computed by wavelet transform method. Vibrotactile feedback was found to be effective in controlling low frequency postural sway in amputees. We found significantly higher energy (p = 0.004, 0.0007) at shorter time-scales (j = 6,7, freq. = 0.6-1.25 Hz) and lower energy (p = 0.0006) at longer time-scale (j = 10, freq. = 0.078 Hz) in amputees with vibrotactile feedback in comparison to healthy subjects using Coif 1 wavelet. We also found significant increase in energy (p = 0.003) during forward weight shifting with vibrotactile feedback in the sound limb of amputees in comparison to no feedback session at frequency/time-scales corresponding to somatosensory acuity (j = 6-8, freq. = 0.3-1.5 Hz) using Haar wavelet.

Based on recent findings that RFE was preserved in the reduced force state, one may speculate that the SSC effect may be preserved in the reduced force state as well. The purpose of this study was to examine the magnitude of the SSC effect in inhibited skeletal muscle force states. Normal and inhibited force conditions were analyzed using skinned rabbit soleus fibres (N = 18). The inhibited force condition was achieved by adding 2,3-Butanedione monoxime into the activating solution. For both conditions, a SSC test and a pure shortening test were performed. In the SSC tests, fibres were activated at an average sarcomere length of 2.4 μm, and then stretched to 3.0 μm. Immediately after the end of the stretch, fibres were shortened to 2.4 μm. In the pure shortening tests, fibres were activated at an average sarcomere length of 3.0 μm and then shortened to 2.4 μm. The relative increase in mechanical work in the shortening phase of the SSC compared to the pure shortening condition was defined as the SSC effect index, and the magnitude of the SSC effect was compared between the normal and the inhibited force condition. The SSC effect was greater in the inhibited compared to the normal force condition (p < 0.001).

Here, starting from the works of Decuzzi and Ferrari, who examined how the energy of a cell varies while adhering to a nanoscale surface, and of Armstrong and collaborators, who developed a continuous model of cell-cell adhesion and morphogenesis, we provide a description of how nanotopography can modulate cellular clustering. In simulations where the parameters of the model were varied over large intervals, we found that nanoroughness may induce cell aggregation from a homogenous, uniform state, also for weak cell-cell adhesion.

Using nonlinear, large deformation finite element simulations, the deformation of the bladder wall during urine storage is modeled in this study. The bladder wall is assumed to be a homogeneous, isotropic, hyperelastic spherical shell with a finite thickness. The UVJ is defined as a straight elliptical cylindrical hole through the bladder wall at the reference configuration before inflation. Broad parametric studies on different UVJ configurations are performed as the bladder inner surface stretches by a factor of 2.2 from an initial radius corresponding to bladder volumes of 10% to slightly over physiologic capacity. For each considered UVJ configuration, a simple fluid analysis of the tunnel flow resistance compares different bladder inner surface stretch ratios. Our model shows that the deformation of the UVJ depends on its orientation with respect to the bladder wall radial and circumferential directions. We show that as the UVJ insertion angle increases, the UVJ cross section decreases and its tunnel length increases during urine storage causing the closure of the UVJ and a rise in its flow resistance. The modeling results indicate that UVJ closure could be explained by bladder wall deformation rather than the local differential pressure. Our findings are consistent with the accepted primary anti-reflux mechanism of the UVJ being dependent on the tunnel length-to-diameter ratio and consequently the UVJ insertion angle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, knee joint biomechanics during cycling remains mostly unknown for TKA patients. Biomechanical differences between the replaced and non-replaced limb may inform applications of cycling in TKA rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to examine the knee joint biomechanics of TKA patients during stationary cycling. Fifteen TKA participants cycled at 80 revolutions per minute and workrates of 80 W and 100 W while kinematics (240 Hz) and pedal reaction forces using a pair of instrumented pedals (1200 Hz) were collected.

Peak KEM did not change for TKA patients with the increased workrate (p = 0.750). However, both peak hip extension moment (p = 0.009) and ankle plantarflexion moment (p = 0.017) increased due to increased workrate. Patients following TKA showed similar decreases in peak KEM and vertical pedal reaction force in their replaced compared to non-replaced limbs, as previously seen in gait.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of hospital bed height on natural transition during egress in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Twelve patients with PD and fourteen healthy elderly adults (HEA) were recruited and the natural transition during egress from three different bed heights (low, medium and high) were recorded for each participant using a motion capture system and force plates. The bed egress time, joint kinematics, ground reaction force and center of mass (CoM) were compared using a two-factor repeated ANOVA to determine the effects of three bed heights and two groups. The results showed that patients with PD had a significantly increased bed egress time, decreased peak of pelvis anterior tilt, hip flexion, and anteroposterior distance between pelvis center and CoM compared to HEA. Additionally, both PD and HEA groups increased the peak of trunk, hip and knee flexions to generate forward CoM momentum and joint torque to rise from a low bed height. These findings indicated that patients with PD invoked a more conservative movement pattern than HEA during egress to improve postural stability.

The primary objectives were to introduce a new method for determining the optimal baseplate orientation to minimize bias error during MBRSA and to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of the method using a knee positioning guide to repeatably orient the baseplate. A tibia phantom was rotated to achieve 24 different orientations with three pairs of radiographs acquired at each orientation. Radiographs were processed in MBRSA software and the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM), an indicator of bias error during model registration, was plotted as a function of the rotation angles to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations. The bias error decreased 85% between the reference orientation and the optimal orientation. An acceptable range of orientations was defined by a decrease in bias error more than 50%. Future researchers can use this method to determine the optimal orientation and a range of acceptable orientations for their specific baseplate to minimize bias error. Clinical usefulness was demonstrated by repeatedly imaging a knee model placed in a knee positioning guide (simulated clinical positioning) and demonstrating that the mean orientation ± one standard deviation fell within the acceptable range of orientations. Thus, use of a knee positioning guide was an effective tool for repeatable patient positioning and should be considered for future RSA studies to maintain consistent positioning during a longitudinal study.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Though considerable modeling work has characterized the mechanics of accommodation, little has been done to understand the mechanics of the lens capsule after cataract surgery. As such, we present the first 3-D finite element model of the post-surgical human lens capsule with an implanted tension ring and, separately, an intraocular lens to characterize the altered stress field compared to that in a model of the native lens capsule. All finite element models employed a Holzapfel hyperelastic constitutive model with regional variations in anisotropy. The post-surgical lens capsule demonstrated a dramatic perturbation to the stress field with mostly large reductions in stresses (except at the equator where the implant contacts the capsule) compared to native, wherein maximal changes in Cauchy stress were -100% and -145% for the tension ring and intraocular lens, respectively. However, implantation of the tension ring produced a more uniform stress field compared to the IOL. The magnitudes and distribution of the perturbed stress field may be an important driver of the fibrotic response of inhabiting lens epithelial cells and associated lens capsule remodeling after cataract surgery. Thus, the mechanical effects of an implant on the lens capsule could be an essential consideration in the design of intraocular lenses, particularly those with an accommodative feature.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although leg stiffness has not been directly quantified in cutting, indirect evidence suggest that greater stiffness may benefit cutting speed, but lower stiffness may benefit cut angle. No studies have investigated if stiffness causally mediates the relationship between anticipation, cutting speed and angle. The aims of the present study were to determine the influence of anticipatory cues on leg stiffness, and quantify the mediation effects of stiffness on cutting speed and angle. Seventeen healthy participants performed a 45° cut at an approach speed of 4 m/s. Leg stiffness (% bodyweight/leg length [BW/LL]), cutting angle and change in running speed between initial contact and toe-off of the cut were calculated. Causal mediation analysis was performed with anticipatory cues as the independent variable, cutting speed and angle as the dependent variables, and stiffness as the mediator. Unanticipated cutting significantly increased leg stiffness (β=3.82%BW/LL,P=0.005) compared to anticipated cutting. The average causal mediation effect of stiffness on cutting angle was not significant (P = 0.68). The average causal mediation effect of stiffness on cutting speed was significant (-0.02 m/s [95%CI -0.04 to 0.00 m/s, P = 0.016). Reduced preplanning time in cutting increased leg stiffness. Alterations in leg stiffness only explained the change in speed, and not angle, associated with cutting under different anticipatory cues. Loss of speed when cutting is unplanned may be mitigated by improving leg stiffness.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Gait regularity is typically quantified by an autocorrelation analysis of trunk/pelvis accelerations. A methodological upgrade fosters a multi-sensor approach including upper and lower limbs. Very few studies dealt with gait regularity using gyroscope data and no comparison between the two inertial sensors has been published. Therefore, this study compares gait regularity assessment by autocorrelation analyses performed on accelerometer and gyroscope data simultaneously acquired. Twenty-five adult healthy subjects walked steady-state on treadmill at three speeds (3.6, 5.0, 6.4 km/h), with rest between. Four IMUs were firmly attached on the trunk, pelvis, wrist and ankle. The autocorrelation method was applied to time-windows of the signal vector magnitude and resulted, on average for each trial, in its regularity index (RI) and periodicity index (PI), i.e. the stride time. Results showed that both sensors identified the same PI (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.999), and evidenced that, for matched sensor locations and gait speeds, the accelerometer-based RI was larger/equal to the gyroscope-based RI on 86.3% of all conditions (overall median of gyroscope-to-accelerometer RI ratio was 91.1%). The two sensors gave always statistically different RI, with the exception of the ankle at the lowest speed and wrist at higher speeds. Such results help remove potential confounders from analyses performed with different sensors and support the use of accelerometers for gait regularity assessment, not excluding that gyroscopes may be more suitable for other human movements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Its deformation has also to be taken into account because of the forces caused by the fluid; if the tumor region is not isothermal, this deformation can be also strongly affected by temperature fields. In this paper, the effects of thermal boundary conditions on a tumor region periphery with an internal heat source are investigated. The tumor region is modeled as a deformable sphere, in which two phases can be distinguished. The fluid phase is the interstitial fluid, while the rest of the tumor is modeled as the solid phase, including also capillaries and tissues. Transient-state governing equations for mass, momentum and energy are written for both phases, by also considering tumor deformation under the linear elastic material assumption. A situation of Tumor Blood Flow (TBF) rapid decay, in which vascular pressure rapidly approaches to zero, is considered, while the heat source is modeled as a fourth-grade radial-decay function. Boundary conditions for the energy equation are varied on the external surface of the sphere, in order to appreciate the effects of the surrounding on flow and temperature fields inside the tumor. After scaling equations, a finite-element scheme is employed for the numerical solution. Comparisons with analytical solutions from literature show a good agreement. Results are shown for different dimensionless parameters that are referred to temperature, volumetric strain, pressure and velocity, showing in which case external boundary conditions strongly affect tumor region flow fields and a third-kind boundary condition is needed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, this study quantified the effect of loading rate and frequency on the number of tolerated compression cycles. Energy storage and vertical deformation were secondarily examined. Thirty-two porcine spinal units were randomly assigned to experimental groups that differed by loading rate (4.2 kN/s, 8.3 kN/s) and loading frequency (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz). Following preload and range-of-motion tests, specimens were cyclically loaded in a neutral posture until fatigue-failure occurred or 10800 cycles were tolerated. Macroscopic dissection was performed to identify the fracture morphology, and measurements of energy storage and vertical displacement were calculated throughout the specimen lifespan (1%, 10%, 50%, 90%, 99%). Given the differences in compression dose-force-time integral-between experimental conditions, the number of sustained cycles were assessed following linear and nonlinear dose-normalization via correction factors calculated from existing risk-exposure approximations. Without dose-normalization, an 8.3 kN/s loading rate and 0.5 Hz loading frequency reduced the fatigue lifetime by 3541 and 5977 cycles, respectively (p < 0.001). Linear and nonlinear dose-normalization resulted in a significant rate × frequency interaction (p < 0.001). For a 1 Hz loading frequency, the number of sustained loading cycles did not differ between loading rates (padj ≥ 0.988), but at 0.5 Hz, spinal units compressed at 8.3 kN/s sustained 99% (linear) and 97% (nonlinear) fewer cycles (padj < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that the interacting effects of loading frequency and loading rate on spinal fatigue-failure depend on the normalization of dose discrepancies between experimental groups.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, a rigorous biomechanical understanding of how different positions affect a woman's pelvis during labour is currently lacking. It was hypothesized that the position of pubic bones is affected in different positions, and thus the pubic symphysis width changes. Therefore, we measured pubic symphysis width on eleven women in their seventh to ninth months of pregnancy in different positions through three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of pubic symphysis ultrasound images. Positions studies included those used in clinics like supine and lithotomy positions, in addition to squatting and standing, which are recommended by midwives. The results showed that the average superior and inferior pubic symphysis widths in lithotomy, squatting and standing positions were approximately 1 mm larger than those in the supine position. However, no significant difference between lithotomy, squatting and standing positions was found. The results were consistent with those of two comparable studies. A significant difference was only found between standing and squatting, standing and lithotomy in the rotation angle about the medio-lateral axis. The results suggest that positions with thigh hyperflexion and gravity effect make a difference in pubic symphysis width and might have a positive effect in childbirth.

Subject-specific kinematic constraints representing contact point trajectories derived from fluoroscopic measurements during lunge are introduced in a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb and compared to generic kinematic constraints. The medial, lateral, and total contact forces during gait and squat are validated using the data of four patients with an instrumented prosthesis. The accuracy of the estimated contact forces (both with subject-specific and generic kinematic constraints) remains close to the level reported in the literature. The mean root mean square errors range from 0.32 to 0.52 body weights for gait and from 0.27 to 0.72 body weights for squat. The impact of the subject-specific contact point trajectories is not found substantial or consistent between patients and tasks. Indeed, the kinematics of the total knee prostheses remains close to the kinematics of a hinge joint and the contact point locations remain generally centred at 20 mm from the tibia centreline (close to the constant value defined in the generic constraints). The contact point trajectories are also suspected to differ between tasks (lunge vs. gait and squat). While the contact point trajectories have been reported to be sensitive model parameters, no clear improvement of the contact force accuracy is demonstrated on patients with instrumented prosthesis. The introduction (as kinematic constraints) of fluoroscopy-based contact point trajectories may be considered in cases where these trajectories are significantly altered, as reported for osteoarthritis patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous work has demonstrated systematically lower accelerations measured with a bone- compared to skin-mounted accelerometer. However, no studies have assessed the effects of more or less secure attachment methods for skin mounted sensors. Our purpose was to compare two methods of attaching a skin mounted sensor on mean tibial accelerations, stride-to-stride variability, and correlations with vertical load rates. 18 injury-free runners were recruited as participants. An inertial measurement unit, containing a tri-axial accelerometer, was used to record tibial accelerations while participants ran at a self-selected speed on an instrumented treadmill to collect ground reaction forces. The two attachment methods for securing the sensor to the skin were a manufacturer-provided strap (strap condition) and a combination of tape and elastic wraps (wrap condition). Mean vertical accelerations were significantly lower in the wrap condition (p = 0.02, d = 0.57). No differences were detected in resultant accelerations, vertical loading rates, or stride-to-stride variability. Correlations between tibial accelerations and vertical loading rates were strong (r = 0.79-0.91) and similar between conditions. These results provide two key findings of evidence. Evidenced by systematically lower vertical accelerations, a more secure attachment method may be necessary for capturing the most representative measure of tibial accelerations during running. However, a less secure method (i.e. the strap) is sufficient for capturing tibial accelerations as a surrogate for impact loading forces.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

There have been no studies that three-dimensionally measured the distance between the bicipital tuberosity and the proximal ulna during active motion.

Five healthy volunteers (10 forearms) were recruited for this study. They consisted of all males with a mean age of 37 years (range, 34-46 years). Lateral fluoroscopy of forearm rotation from maximum supination to maximum pronation was recorded for both forearms. Three-dimensional forearm kinematics were determined using model-image registration techniques with fluoroscopic images and CT-derived bone models, and the closest distance between the bicipital tuberosity and the proximal ulna was computed at each 30° increment of radial axial rotation relative to the distal humerus. The distance between the bicipital tuberosity and the proximal ulna decreased with pronation, reaching a minimum value at 90° of radial rotation (average 4.6 ± 1.3 mm), then increased with further rotation to maximum pronation (P = 0.004).

Considering that energy absorption strategies have been associated with a reduced risk for sustaining an ACL injury, evaluating landing performance in youth athletes requires investigations beyond the kinematic level. The purpose of this study was to identify sex-specific energy absorption strategies in adolescent males and females, including the relationship between strength and the observed strategies. Thirty-one healthy adolescent athletes completed unanticipated single-leg drop-jump landings on their dominant limb. Sex-specific kinematics and lower-limb contributions to energy absorption were then compared over the landing phase for each jump. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients determined the relationship between isometric joint strength and the observed kinematics and energy absorption. Female participants absorbed a larger proportion of the landing energy at the ankle (p = 0.046, d = 0.75) and smaller proportion at the hip (p = 0.028, d = 0.85) compared to males. Females also reached larger peak negative joint power in their knee (p = 0.001, d = 1.1) and ankle (p = 0.04, d = 0.79). Hip extension strength was positively correlated with trunk flexion (r = 0.559, p = 0.001) and negatively correlated with forward pelvic tilt (r = -0.513, p = 0.003). Females adopted an energy absorption strategy which utilized the distal joints to absorb a larger portion of the landing forces and tended to absorb the forces later in the landing phase relative to males. The greater reliance on distal joints is correlated to reduced hip strength and may increase the risk for sustaining an ACL injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To better understand factors that influence improvements after RBT, the goal of this study was to identify key factors that strongly associate with training-induced improvements in reactive balance. This study is a secondary analysis of data from a prior study. Twenty-eight residents of senior housing facilities participated, including 14 RBT participants and 14 Tai Chi participants (controls). Before and one week after training, participants completed balance and mobility tests and a reactive balance test. Reactive balance was operationalized as the maximum trunk angle in response to standardized trip-like perturbations on a treadmill. Bivariate (Pearson) correlation was used to identify participant characteristics before RBT and measures of performance during RBT that associated with training-induced changes in maximum trunk angle. Maximum trunk angle before reactive balance training exhibited the strongest association with training-induced changes in maximum trunk angle among RBT participants (r2 = 0.84; p < .001), but not among Tai Chi participants (r2 = 0.17; p = .138). Measures of performance during RBT, based upon perturbation speed, also associated with RBT-induced improvements in maximum trunk angle.

In case of fully visible perturbations, humans can anticipate the occurrence and the magnitude of the perturbation. In case of a camouflaged perturbation, they can anticipate the occurrence based on the camouflage cover but need to predict the magnitude from experience, as it is not visible. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticipatory muscular control strategy humans employ when walking down curbs of different height and to investigate how this strategy differs if the step down is fully visible or camouflaged. The activity of five bilateral lower limb muscles (M. gastrocnemius medialis, M. soleus, M. tibialis anterior, M. biceps femoris and M. vastus medialis) of eight healthy subjects was recorded during walking down visible (0, -10 and -20 cm) and camouflaged curbs (0 and -10 cm). The results reveal that the M. gastrocnemius shows a clear anticipatory adaptation to visible curbs in the contralateral and partly also the ipsilateral leg, which further depends on the curb height.

Additionally, runners who develop overuse injuries, such as tibial stress fractures, also have higher loading rates (LR) and impact forces.


PURPOSE
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how uphill treadmill running at iso-efficient speeds (IES; a speed-incline combination having the same metabolic intensity as level running) influences impact LR, and peak vertical ground reaction forces (GRF).


METHODS
Eleven collegiate distance runners completed 3 experimental running conditions (0%, 4%, and 8% treadmill inclination). During each running condition, the metabolic intensity was controlled by implementing an IES for each runner.


RESULTS
All variables of interest were significantly reduced as treadmill incline increased (0% > 4% > 8%).


CONCLUSION
Incline running is more metabolically demanding compared to level running at the same speed.

Such microdamage is associated with plastic deformation and appears as a gradual accumulation of residual strains. The aim of this study is to investigate local residual strains in cortical bone tissue following compressive cyclic loading, using in situ X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and digital volume correlation (DVC) to provide a deeper insight on the three-dimensional (3D) relationship between residual strain accumulation, cortical bone microstructure and failure patterns. Through a progressive in situ XCT loading-unloading scheme, localisation of local residual strains was observed in highly compressed regions. In addition, a multi-scale in situ XCT cyclic test highlighted the differences on residual strain distribution at the microscale and tissue level, where high strains were observed in regions with the thinnest vascular canals and predicted the failure location following overloading. Finally, through a continuous in situ XCT compression test of cycled specimens, the full-field strain evolution and failure pattern indicated the reduced ability of bone to plastically deform after damage accumulation due to high number of cyclic loads. Altogether, the novel experimental methods employed in this study, combining high-resolution in situ XCT mechanics and DVC, showed a great potential to investigate 3D full-field residual strain development under repetitive loading and its complex interaction with bone microstructure, microdamage and fracture.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Studies have shown that changes in intravascular mechanical environment are related to ISR. Hence, an in-depth understanding of the effects of stent intervention on vascular mechanics is important for clinically optimizing stent implantation and relieving ISR. Nine rabbits with stenotic carotid artery were collected by balloon injury. Intravascular stents were implanted into different longitudinal positions (proximal, middle and distal relative to the stenotic area) of the stenotic vessels for numerical simulations. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning was performed to reconstruct the three-dimensional configuration of the stented carotid artery and blood flow velocity waveforms were collected by Doppler ultrasound. The numerical simulations were performed through direct solution of Naiver-Stokes equation in ANSYS. Results showed that the distributions of time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillating shear index (OSI) and relative residual time (RRT) in near-end segment were distinctively different from other regions of the stent which considered to promote restenosis for all three models. Spearman rank-correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between hemodynamic descriptors and the stent longitudinal positions (rTAWSS = -0.718, rOSI = 0.898, rRRT = 0.818, p < 0.01). Histology results of the near-end segment showed neointima thickening deepened with the longitudinal positions of stent which was consistent with the numerical simulations.

Therefore, the force sensing shoes with small sensors and estimation methods based on kinematics from motion capture systems or inertial measurement units were proposed. Recent studies demonstrated methods of extracting GRFs from whole-body joint kinematics, which requires a significant computational load. In this study, we propose a vertical and anterior-posterior GRFs estimation method using a single camera based on the dynamic relationship between the center of mass (CoM) and the GRFs in terms of spring mechanics. The estimation method consisted of two steps: the extraction of the vertical CoM from the video clip and the conversion of the CoM information into GRFs using a walking model. From the image of the greater trochanter that is positioned near the pelvic joint, the vertical CoM was extracted. This was done after removing the artifacts by pelvic rotation and postural change of lower limbs. The parameters of a compliant bipedal walking model were tuned to best match the CoM trajectory coupled with GRFs by spring mechanics. A video camera was used to record the walking trials of five healthy young participants from the side. The walking trials was conducted at three different speeds on the instrumented treadmill; each lasted one minute long. The GRF prediction errors were approximately 9-11%, with the best matching trials found to be at a self-selected gait speed. The prediction of anterior-posterior GRF components showed a more consistent match than the vertical GRF.

It is increasingly recognized that time-dependent mechanical properties of soft tissues influence their physiological functions and are linked to several pathological processes. Nevertheless, soft tissue time-dependent characteristics, especially their micromechanical variation with tissue composition and location, remain poorly understood. Nanoindentation is a well-established technique to measure local elastic properties but has not been fully explored to determine micro-scale time-dependent properties of soft tissues. Here, a nanoindentation-based experimental strategy is implemented to characterize the micro-scale poroelastic and viscoelastic behavior of mouse heart, kidney, and liver tissues. It is demonstrated that heart tissue exhibits substantial mechanical heterogeneity where the elastic modulus varies spatially from 1 to 30 kPa. In contrast, both kidney and liver tissues show relatively homogeneous response with elastic modulus 0.5-3 kPa. All three tissues demonstrate marked load relaxation under constant indentation, where the relaxation behavior is observed to be largely dominated by tissue viscoelasticity. Intrinsic permeability varies among different tissues, where heart tissue is found to be less permeable compared to kidney and liver tissues. Overall, the results presented herein provide key insights into the time-dependent micromechanical behavior of different tissues and can therefore contribute to studies of tissue pathology and tissue engineering applications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, to ensure accurate conclusions are drawn, experimental validation is critical. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the accuracy of strain predictions generated by subject-specific scapula FEMs through comparisons against full-field experimental strains measured using digital volume correlation (DVC). Three cadaveric scapulae were mechanically loaded using a custom-hexapod robot within a micro-CT scanner. BoneDVC was used to quantify resultant experimental full-field strains. Scapula FEMs were generated using three different density-modulus relationships to assign material properties. Two types of boundary conditions (BCs) were simulated: DVC-displacement-driven or applied-force-driven. Third principal strains were compared between the DVC measurements and FEM predictions. With applied-force BCs, poor agreement was observed between the predicted and measured strains (slope range: 0.16-0.19, r2 range: 0.04-0.30). Agreement was improved with the use of DVC-displacement BCs (slope range: 0.54-0.59, r2 range: 0.73-0.75). Strain predictions were independent of the density-modulus relationship used for DVC-displacement BCs, but differences were observed in the correlation coefficient and intercept for applied-force BCs. Overall, this study utilized full-field DVC-derived experimental strains for comparison with FEM predicted strains in models with varying material properties and BCs. It was found that fair agreement can be achieved in localized strain measurements between DVC measurements and FEM predictions when DVC-displacement BCs are used. However, performance suffered with use of applied-force BCs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twelve children with SDCP were tested with three conditions of STS task: low chair with horizontal seat (control), low chair with anterior seat inclination (AiC), and high chair with horizontal seat (HiC) conditions. A 3D motion analysis system and two force plates were used to collect and analyze the movement time, mechanical work, kinematics, and kinetics. The results showed that in the AiC and HiC conditions, movement time and mechanical work during STS were significantly reduced when compared with the control condition. In addition, in the AiC condition, trunk alignment at the beginning of the STS task improved and the range of pelvis movement reduced, whereas in the HiC condition, the range of movement of hip, knee, and ankle joint and maximum hip and knee extension moment were reduced in children with SDCP when compared with the control condition. These results suggest that chair height and anterior seat inclination may have a positive effect on STS ability in children with SDCP.

The effect of a concurrent text-based math task on dynamic stability control remains unclear during stair descent when considering the influence of gait velocity. Twenty-six participants performed three successful stair descent trials under TEXTING or NO-TEXTING conditions at their preferred speed. Synchronous kinematics and kinetics were collected by an eight-camera Vicon infrared motion capture system and two force platforms. Repeated measures analysis of covariance and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze the differences between the two different task conditions with gait velocity as a covariate. The outcomes indicated that under TEXTING condition, sagittal margin of stability increased at right-foot-landing; step cadence, double-support percentage, sagittal and frontal joint moment decreased; and sagittal and frontal joint angles were also modified. It is concluded that concurrent TEXTING impaired sagittal and frontal stability control during stair descent despite slowing down the step cadence. Knee and ankle joint adjustment strategies were mainly adopted in response to stability control in the sagittal plane with the interference of TEXTING, whereas the hip joint adjustment strategy was adopted in the frontal plane. In conclusion, texting behaviors on mobile phones should be minimized during stair descent.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The middle third of an injured patient's patellar tendon (PT) is a commonly used graft for ACL reconstruction. However, many clinicians and researchers question whether it is the best option, as several studies have suggested that it is a stiffer material than the ACL. Still, there is little to no consensus on even the most basic material property of ligaments/tendons: the tangent modulus in the fiber direction, or slope of the linear portion of the uniaxial stress-strain curve. In this study, we investigate the effect of fiber splay (the tendency of collagen fibers to spread out near the enthesis) on the apparent tangent modulus. Using a simplified theoretical model, we establish a quantity we call the splay ratio, which describes the relationship between splay geometry and the apparent tangent modulus. We then more rigorously investigate the effect of the splay ratio on the apparent tangent modulus of the ovine PT and anteromedial and posterolateral regions of the ACL using experimental and computational methods. Both approaches confirmed that splay geometry significantly affects the apparent material behavior. Because true material properties are independent of geometry, we conclude that the macroscopic response of ligaments and tendons is not sufficient for the characterization of their material properties, but rather is reflective of both material and structural properties. We further conclude that the PT is probably not a stiffer material than ACL, but that the PT graft is likely a stiffer structure than either ACL region.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study assessed the between-day reliability of the HIKOB FOX IMU in measuring local dynamic stability (LDS) and variability of trunk movements in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). The local divergence exponent (λmax) was used to quantify LDS and the mean standard deviation (MeanSD) between cycles was used to quantify variability during 30 repetitive cycles of flexion/extension, rotation, and complex movement tasks. For λmax the average coefficient of variation (CV) was ~10% in the flexion/extension and rotation tasks, and all CV values were <20% when also including the complex task. ICC values for λmax ranged from 0.28 to 0.81. Reliability of λmax was similar between the pelvis and thorax segments (CV: ~10%, ICC: 0.48-0.78) and worse for the lumbar spine (CV: ~15%, ICC: 0.28-0.59). The CV for MeanSD was typically in the range of 20-30%, with even greater CV in the non-primary axes during each task (30-52%). Similarly, ICC values were lowest about the anterior-posterior axis in the flexion/extension task (ICC: 0.15-0.29) and largest about the longitudinal axis in the rotation task (ICC: 0.76-0.88). The moderate between-day reliability of λmax in the sagittal and transverse planes offers improvement over manual and subjective tests with poor reliability that are currently used in clinics.

Surface electromyograms (sEMG) of a large number of muscles and force sensors have been used to develop control algorithms for lower limb powered prostheses, but there are no commercial sEMG controlled prostheses available to date. Unlike ankle disarticulation, transtibial amputation yields less intact lower leg muscle mass. Therefore, minimizing the use of sEMG muscle sources utilized will make powered prosthesis controller economic, and limiting the use of specifically the lower leg muscles will make it flexible. Presently, we have used healthy population data to (1) test the feasibility of the neural network (NN) approach for developing a powered ankle prosthesis control algorithm that successfully predicts sagittal ankle angle and moment during walking using exclusively sEMG, and (2) rank all muscle combination variations according to their success to determine the economic and flexible NN's. sEMG amplitudes of five lower extremity muscles were used as inputs: the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and gluteus maximus (GM). A time-delay feed-forward-multilayer-architecture NN algorithm was developed. Muscle combination variations were ranked using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r > 0.95 indicates successful correlations) and root-mean-square error between actual vs. estimated ankle position and moment.

In the wrist, these have often been obtained through in vitro motion analysis. These definitions are then employed for in vivo applications, such as the design of implants or the development of musculoskeletal models. However, functional unguided joint motions are, by definition, affected by the activity of muscles. Previously published data has disagreed on the relative position and orientation of the two primary axes of rotation of the wrist, i.e. the radioulnar deviation (RUD) axis with respect to the flexion-extension (FE) axis. An in vivo study comparing the FE and RUD IHAs and SDAs of guided motions, to replicate in vitro conditions, and unguided motions of 23 healthy participants was conducted using optical motion capture. Guided motions were performed with the hand and forearm flush against a flat surface. The relative position and orientation of the RUD SDAs with respect to the FE SDAs differed (p = 0.019, p = 0.001) between unguided FE and guided RUD (0.1 ± 4.3 mm, 93.5 ± 16.0°) and guided FE and RUD (1.6 ± 4.0 mm, 107.8 ± 17.7°). This indicates that the use of different constraints, and not physiological differences, is the primary cause of differences in the relative positions and orientations of the FE and RUD axes in the literature. Thus, the practice of using in vitro definitions of the axes of rotation of the wrist for in vivo applications, especially involving FE, may be inappropriate and care must be taken to account for any constraint on wrist motion. It is recommended that investigators define the axes of rotation specifically for their study or refer to literature featuring the desired levels of constraint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We propose a new zero-dimensional model for the pressure drop across the stenosis considering its geometric characteristics and flow rate. To identify the geometric parameters affecting the pressure drop, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations for thirty-three patient-specific coronary stenoses. From these numerical simulations, we show that the pressure drop is mostly determined by the curvature as well as the area-reduction ratio of the stenosis before the minimal luminal area (MLA), but heavily depends on the area-expansion ratio after the MLA due to flow separation. Based on this result, we divide the stenosis into the converging and diverging parts in the present zero-dimensional model. The converging part is segmented into a series of straight and curved pipes with curvatures, and the loss of each pipe is estimated by an empirical relation between the total pressure drop, flow rate, and pipe geometric parameters (length, diameter, and curvature). The loss in the diverging part is predicted by a relation among the total pressure drop, Reynolds number, and area expansion ratio with the coefficients determined by a machine learning method. The pressure drops across the stenoses predicted by the present zero-dimensional model agree very well with those obtained from three-dimensional numerical simulations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Moreover, several quantitative MRI techniques are significantly influenced by the magic angle effect. The combinations of ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI with magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) and Adiabatic T1ρ (UTE-AdiabT1ρ) imaging allow magic angle-insensitive assessments of all regions of articular cartilage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlations between quantitative three-dimensional UTE MRI biomarkers and mechanical properties of human tibiofemoral cartilage specimens. In total, 40 human tibiofemoral cartilage specimens were harvested from three male and four female donors (64 ± 18 years old). Cartilage samples were scanned using a series of quantitative 3D UTE Cones T2* (UTE-T2*), T1 (UTE-T1), UTE-AdiabT1ρ, and UTE-MT sequences in a standard knee coil on a clinical 3T scanner. UTE-MT data were acquired with a series of MT powers and frequency offsets to calculate magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), as well as macromolecular fraction (MMF) and macromolecular T2 (T2mm) through modeling. Cartilage stiffness and Hayes elastic modulus were measured using indentation tests. Correlations of 3D UTE Cones MRI measurements in the superficial layer, deep layer, and global regions of interest (ROIs) with mechanical properties were investigated. Cartilage mechanical properties demonstrated highest correlations with UTE measures of the superficial layer of cartilage. AdiabT1ρ, MTR, and MMF in superficial layer ROIs showed significant correlations with Hayes elastic modulus (p < 0.05, R = -0.54, 0.49, and 0.66, respectively). These UTE measures in global ROIs showed significant, though slightly lower, correlations with Hayes elastic modulus (p < 0.05, R = -0.37, 0.52, and 0.60, respectively). Correlations between other UTE MRI measurements (T2*, T1, and T2mm) and mechanical properties were non-significant.

Seventy-two subjects were included in the test-retest, with a one week interval. The plantar pressure maps were constructed using a pressure platform.

Forty (age 36 ± 11 years) manual wheelchair users propelled their own daily living wheelchair at 1.11 m·s-1 for three minutes on a dual-roller ergometer. Shoulder pain was evaluated using the Performance Corrected Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (PC-WUSPI). Correlation analyses between spatio-temporal, kinetic and upper limb kinematic variables during wheelchair propulsion and PC-WUSPI scores were assessed. Furthermore, kinematic differences between wheelchair users with no or mild shoulder pain (n = 33) and moderate pain (n = 7) were investigated using statistical parametric mapping. Participant mean PC-WUSPI scores were 20.3 ± 26.3 points and varied from zero up to 104 points. No significant correlations were observed between kinetic or spatio-temporal parameters of wheelchair propulsion and shoulder pain. However, lower inter-cycle variability of scapular internal/external rotation was associated with greater levels of shoulder pain (r = 0.35, P = 0.03). Wheelchair users with moderate pain displayed significantly lower scapular kinematic variability compared to those with mild or no pain between 17 and 51% of the push phase for internal rotation, between 31-42% and 77-100% of the push phase for downward rotation and between 28-36% and 53-65% of the push phase for posterior tilt. Lower scapular variability displayed by wheelchair users with moderate shoulder pain may reflect a more uniform distribution of repeated subacromial tissue stress imposed by propulsion. This suggests that lower scapular kinematic variability during propulsion may contribute towards the development of chronic shoulder pain.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here, we show the substantial contributions of non-extension movements, in generating mechanical energy directly contributing to the jumping height (Evert) in RSLJ. We determined the component of increase in Evert due to each segment movement in RSLJs by 13 male high-jumpers. The stance-leg shank forward rotation (rotation opposite to the actions of the knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors on the shank), increased Evert (0.76 ± 0.70 J/kg). Evert due to the stance-leg thigh forward rotation (4.39 ± 0.57 J/kg) was substantially larger than the inflowing energy into the thigh (difference: 2.36 ± 0.42 J/kg). These results suggest that the forward rotations of the shank and thigh transformed horizontal kinetic energy (Ehori) to Evert.Evert was increased by the elevation of the free-leg side of the pelvis (0.53 ± 0.22 J/kg) and rotation of free-leg thigh (1.52 ± 0.26 J/kg). The non-extension movements contributed to over half (59 ± 6%) the increase in Evert during the take-off phase. Human-specific morphologies are essential for the contributions of non-extension movements; fully extensible knee joints and relatively longer legs with respect to body mass for the transformation from Ehori to Evert by shank and thigh rotations, and a wide and short pelvis for increasing Evert by pelvic elevation.

Genipin-crosslinked fibrin (FibGen) hydrogel is an injectable AF sealant previously shown to partially restore IVD motion segment biomechanical properties. A small animal model of herniation and repair is needed to evaluate repair potential for early-stage screening of IVD repair strategies prior to more costly large animal and eventual human studies. This study developed an ex-vivo rat caudal IVD herniation model and characterized torsional, axial tension-compression and stress relaxation biomechanical properties before and after herniation injury with or without repair using FibGen. Injury group involved an annular defect followed by removal of nucleus pulposus tissue to simulate a severe herniation while Repaired group involved FibGen injection. Injury significantly altered axial range of motion, neutral zone, torsional stiffness, torque range and stress-relaxation biomechanical parameters compared to Intact. FibGen repair restored the stress-relaxation parameters including effective hydraulic permeability indicating it effectively sealed the IVD defect, and there was a trend for improved tensile stiffness and axial neutral zone length. This study demonstrated a model for studying IVD herniation injury and repair strategies using rat caudal IVDs ex-vivo and demonstrated FibGen sealed IVDs to restore water retention and IVD pressurization.

Recent studies have reported methods for predicting GRFs from IMU measurement data by using artificial neural networks (ANNs). To obtain reliable predictions, the ANN requires a large number of measurement inputs at the cost of wearable convenience. Recognizing that the dynamic relationship between the center of mass (CoM) and GRF can be well represented by using spring mechanics, in this study we propose two GRF prediction methods based on the implementation of walking dynamics in a neural network. Method 1 takes inputs to the network that were CoM kinematics data and Method 2 employs forces approximated from CoM kinematics by applying spring mechanics. The gait data of seven young healthy subjects were collected at various walking speeds. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed with normalized root mean square error and r as quantitative measures of prediction performance. The vertical and anteroposterior (AP) GRFs obtained using both methods agreed well with the experimental data, but Method 2 yielded improved predictions of AP GRF compared to Method 1 (p = 0.005).

Muscle fatigue is a variable able to influence neuromuscular control, altering muscle activation timing and proprioception. The aim of the study was to describe shoulder complex HAs dispersion after muscle fatigue during upper limb movements of young healthy subjects. Thirty healthy right-handed volunteers (age 23.2 ± 2.6 years) were asked to perform a test made up of 15 humerothoracic flexion and rotation movements using both upper limbs in two different recording sessions. After each session, muscles of the tested movement were fatigued in isometric condition at dominant side. After fatigue, subjects repeated the test. Kinematics was recorded by an optoelectronic system and HAs dispersion was computed using Mean Distance (MD) and Mean Angle (MA) for the entire Range of Motion (RoM) and in portions of RoM. After fatigue of shoulder flexion muscles, greater MD (p = 0.001) and MA (p = 0.019) were found on the dominant side. After fatigue of shoulder rotation muscles, greater MD and MA were found on the dominant (p = 0.002 for MD; p = 0.047 for MA) and non-dominant (p = 0.038 for MD; p = 0.019 for MA) sides.

It equips researchers with a shared lexicon for describing their research and, in this way, adoption of a normative description facilitates communication within the research community. Although there is an abundance of descriptions of sit-to-stand movement, there is not a commonly accepted normative description of sit-to-stand; study-specific descriptions are commonplace. This work evaluates the breadth of existing sit-to-stand descriptions using new experimental data from 15 healthy young adults standing from a 46 cm chair. Our goal is to develop a normative description of the sit-to-stand motion that is in harmony with the literature. After aligning experimental data to seat-off (the one sit-to-stand event with a clear definition), events defining the start of sit-to-stand, seat-off, and the end of sit-to-stand are identified using a density-based clustering method. Then, the intermediary events of start of seat unloading, end of momentum transfer, and beginning of stabilization are determined while maintaining consistent sequencing and biomechanical meaning. These six events of sit-to-stand are determined from trunk, hip, knee, and ankle angle data and vertical ground reaction forces. The events are in greatest accordance with the descriptions of sit-to-stand introduced by Schenkman et al. (1990) and Kralj et al. (1990), and the event timings are in alignment with the findings of other researchers. The proposed description of healthy sit-to-stand promotes consistency in the description of this motion and adoption of this description will promote effective communication in sit-to-stand research.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Important parameters include the fascicle length, the angle of pennation, the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) as well as aponeurosis and tendon dimensions. During growth, skeletal muscles have to react to an increasing body mass and size demanding adaptations in muscle dimensions. Investigations of muscle architectural changes during growth are sparse, and existing studies often confine their scope to specific parameters or regions of the muscle. For this cross-sectional study, we determined the entire three-dimensional fascicle architecture of rabbit M. soleus via manual digitization. To this end, the investigations covered nine rabbits in the age-range between 29 days and 109 days. Fascicle length, muscle belly length, and aponeurosis length increased by 40%, 107%, and 111%, respectively. As the pennation angle remained almost constant and the contribution of fascicle length growth to muscle belly growth was minor, the increase in muscle mass primarily led to an increase in PCSA (462%), which required a similar increase in aponeurosis area (434%). Results gain new insight into the build-up of rabbit M. soleus and reveal that increases in muscle belly length are primarily connected to increases in aponeurosis length (83%). Contributions from fascicle length increase (17%) only play a minor role.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Spatiotemporal behavior (step time, length, and speed) has been investigated in starting, stopping, and walking to running transitions, but speed transitions during walking have yet to be investigated. This study quantified the spatiotemporal parameter behavior during walking speed transitions with a range of magnitudes (or differences between pre- and post-transition normalized speeds ranging from 0.03 to 0.13, or approximately 1.18 m/s to 1.58 m/s). 23 healthy adults walked on a treadmill at five different constant speeds for one minute each to establish a baseline. They then performed walking speed transitions, in which they walked on the treadmill as it randomly changed between the five speeds. Linear mixed effect models showed that subjects converged to slightly different post-transition step time and step length averages than established in the constant speed baseline, but the differences are likely too small to be meaningful (on the order of 0.01 s and 0.01 m). When diverging from the pre-transition speed, subjects either diverged in only step time (with step length remaining the same), only step length (with step time remaining the same), or both step time and step length to reach the post-transition speed, with the behavior strongly tied to the magnitude of the speed transition (p<0.001). Step time often overshot the new value before converging. The number of steps required for each parameter to converge increased with increasing transition magnitude (p<0.001) and was consistently higher at all magnitudes for speed than step time and length (p<0.001). In summary, transition magnitude affected the spatiotemporal behavior during walking speed transitions. Further, step time, length, and speed all exhibited slightly different divergence and convergence behavior during transitions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Machine learning techniques have been developed to measure biomechanical parameters with body-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. However, a robust method to classify runners is still unavailable. In this paper, we developed two models to classify running performance and predict biomechanical parameters of 30 subjects. We named the models RunNet-CNN and RunNet-MLP based on their architectures: convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), respectively. In addition, we examined two validation approaches, subject-wise (leave-one-subject-out) and record-wise. RunNet-MLP classified runner's performance levels with an overall accuracy of 97.1%. Our results also showed that RunNet-CNN outperformed RunNet-MLP and gradient boosting decision tree in predicting biomechanical parameters. RunNet-CNN showed good agreement (R2 > 0.9) with the ground-truth reference on biomechanical parameters. The prediction accuracy for the record-wise method was better than the subject-wise method regardless of biomechanical parameters or models.

In the process of probing cell biomechanics the passage of a cell through a narrow microchannel or a small pore has attracted much attention during the recent years. And the study of cellular deformability and transportability using these systems with enhanced resolution and accuracy has opened a new paradigm for high-throughput characterization of both healthy and diseased cell populations.Here we use the level-set method to explore the relationship between the transit time and mechanical properties of normal white blood cells (WBCs) and breast cancer epithelial cells (MCF7) under different microenvironmental parameters (i.e., pressure difference, cell size, effective cell surface tension, constriction size and taper angle) in a 2-D computational domain by considering the cell as a viscous drop. The novel biomechanical relations are obtained for each cell type by the Response Surface Method (RSM), relating microenvironmental parameters to the dimensionless entry time of the normal and cancer cells. Our results revealed that MCF7 cells show asignificantly different behavior (a bifurcating behavior when the pressure difference of inlet/outlet increases) in regards to the dimensionless entry time as a function of microchannel taper angle in comparison with the WBC. These results suggest that the microenvironmental parameters have a significant effect on the transportability of the cells and different cells have different behaviors in response to a specific microenvironmental parameter. Finally, it can be claimed that this method can be also utilized to distinguish between benign and cancerous cells or even to probe tumor heterogeneity toward high throughput cell cytometry.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This paper presents a novel gait pattern prediction model based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Gait data were collected from one hundred and twenty healthy young adults (78 males and 42 females), who were instructed to walk back and forth on a 12-meter-long walking platform while having their heel strike coinciding with the beat of a metronome. The lower-limb joint (i.e., the hip, knee and ankle) angular kinematics were segmented, resampled and transformed into Fourier coefficients. The LASSO regression model with age, gender and 14 anthropometric parameters as prediction variables was trained and used to estimate the Fourier coefficients which were then applied in the lower-limb joint angle trajectory reconstruction. The results showed that the root mean square errors between the actual and predicted joint angle trajectories ranged from 3.41° to 4.55°. The parameters of the linear fit method further revealed the waveform similarity between the actual and predicted joint angle time series. These results suggested that the proposed model was able to accurately predict lower-limb joint kinematics during gait. Application of the proposed model can help resolve the overfitting problem, and provides a new solution to individualized gait pattern prediction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Finite element models with different constitutive models (linear-elastic, isotropic hyperelastic, and fiber-dependent) were established to simulate the non-contact tonometry test. The results showed that the corneal nonlinear mechanical property and fiber distribution had significant effects on the corneal deflection profile.

Post-TKR (82.4 ± 6.7 months), gait analysis was performed on 25 patients (27 knees), to calculate knee kinematics and kinetics. For a step activity, video fluoroscopic analysis quantified in-vivo implant kinematics. Frontal plane lower-limb alignment was defined by the Hip-Knee-Ankle angle (HKA) measured on long leg static X-rays. Transverse plane component rotation was calculated from computed tomography scans. Sagittal plane alignment was defined by measuring the flexion angle of the femoral component and the posterior tibial slope angle (PTSA). For gait analysis, a more varus HKA correlated with increased peak and dynamic joint kinetics, predicting 47.6% of Knee Adduction Angular Impulse variance. For the step activity, during step-up and single leg loaded, higher PTSA correlated with a posterior shift in medial compartment Anterior-Posterior (AP) translation. During step-down, higher PTSA correlated with reduced lateral compartment AP translation with a posterior shift in AP translation in both compartments. A more varus HKA correlated with a more posterior medial AP translation and inter-component rotation was related to transverse plan range of motion. This in-vivo study found that frontal plane lower-limb alignment had a significant effect on joint forces during gait but had minimal influence on in-vivo implant kinematics for step activity.

Increased trunk stiffness and decreased trunk damping have been shown in people with recurrent LBP. However, no study has examined these properties using external force perturbations to the trunk during acute LBP when protective adaptations might be expected to have most relevance. Adaptations to an acute painful stimulus via unilateral injection of hypertonic saline into the right longissimus muscle were assessed using a trunk force perturbation paradigm and a mass-spring-damper model to describe effective trunk dynamical properties. Equal weights (15% body weight) were connected to the front and back of the trunk via a cable. Either one was dropped at random to perturb the trunk. Effective trunk dynamical properties were estimated in fourteen males (mean (standard deviation) age 25 (6) years) assuming that trunk movement can be modelled as a second order linear system. Effective trunk dynamical properties were compared before, during and after the experimentally induced painful period. Estimates of effective trunk stiffness (K) decreased and damping (B) increased during pain compared to both before ([mean contrast, 95% CI] K: -403 [-651 to -155] Nm-1, B: 28 [9-50] Nms-1) and after (K: -324 [-58 to -591] Nm-1, B: 20 [4-33] Nms-1) the experimentally induced painful period.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that racial differences in gait mechanics exist between African Americans (AA) and white Americans (WA). Ninety-two participants (18-30 years old) were recruited with equal numbers in each racial group and sex. Self-selected walking speed was measured for each participant. 3D motion capture and force plate data were recorded during 7 walking trials at regular and fast set speeds. Step length, step width, peak vertical ground reaction force, peak hip extension, peak knee flexion, and peak ankle plantarflexion were computed for all trials at both set speeds. Multivariate and post-hoc univariate ANOVA models were fit to determine main and interaction effects of sex and race (SPSS V26, α = 0.05). Self-selected walking speed was slower in AA (p = 0.004, ƞp2 = 0.088). No significant interactions between race and sex were identified. Males took longer steps (regular: p < 0.001, ƞp2 = 0.288, fast: p < 0.001, ƞp2 = 0.193) and had larger peak knee flexion (regular: p = 0.007, ƞp2 = 0.081, fast: p < 0.001, ƞp2 = 0.188) and ankle plantarflexion angles (regular: p = 0.050, ƞp2 = 0.044, fast: p = 0.049, ƞp2 = 0.044).

Specifically, common complications include instability, separation, sliding, and edge loading within the hip joint. Unfortunately, evaluating potential solutions to these issues can be costly and time-consuming. Fortunately, mathematical modeling is an accurate and efficient tool that can be used to evaluate potential solutions. A forward dynamics mathematical model of the hip allows users to virtually insert a hip implant into a theoretical patient and observe the predicted postoperative mechanics. The objective of this study is therefore to develop, validate, and use a fully functional forward solution mathematical model that allows for a comparison between various hip implant designs and a determination of factors leading to in vivo hip separation, instability, and edge loading. The model presented herein has been validated kinetically against telemetric data and kinematically against fluoroscopic data. It was determined through this research that shifting of the joint rotation center during total hip arthroplasty has the potential to yield postoperative instability, and surgical errors can exacerbate these outcomes. However, the relationships between subject-specific joint shifting and hip instability are extremely complex, and therefore it becomes essential for surgeons to focus on implanting components as accurately as possible to minimize these risks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We recently published such data for autopsied aortas and the present aim was to measure axial residual stretches at different wall depths, along with layer thicknesses on images borrowed from that work. Residual stretches at the external surface and medial-adventitial interface increased along the aorta's ascending course, decreased along its descending course, and increased from the diaphragm toward the iliac arteries. Residual stretches at the intimal-medial interface and internal surface decreased down the distal one-third of the aorta. A continuous decrease in medial thickness was witnessed along the vessel, whereas intimal and adventitial thickness remained fairly stable. At some axial locations, smaller were the axial residual stretches of the outer than those of the other quadrants, with minor differences in layer-specific thicknesses among quadrants. Adventitial thickness did not vary with age, while the intima and media thickened considerably with different time-courses. The observed intimal thickening solely between young (≤40 yr) and middle-aged subjects (40-60 yr) is consistent with the increased circumferential residual stretches previously established by our group between those subject groups and the minimal further increase in old subjects (≥60 yr). The observed medial thickening between middle-aged and old subjects was accompanied by decreased axial residual stretches that were not seen between young and middle-aged subjects.

It was hypothesized that increased residual bone movement would correlate to worse patient-reported comfort and function. The secondary goals were to assess within-subject step-to-step variability and between-subject variability in residual femur motion within the socket during gait. Dynamic biplane radiography, combined with conventional motion capture, was used to measure residual femur motion within the socket during treadmill walking for 10 unilateral transfemoral amputees. The questionnaire for persons with a transfemoral amputation (Q-TFA) was administered to assess prosthetic use, mobility, health problems, and global health. Increased femur pistoning (proximal-distal translation relative to the socket) correlated with worsening Q-TFA problem and global scores (ρ = 0.741, p = 0.04 and ρ = -0.783, p = 0.02, respectively). Average residual femur rotation ROMs were 7.3°±3.7°, 10.8°±4.4°, and 7.7°±4.8° for anterior tilt, internal-external rotation, and varus-valgus, respectively. Average residual femur translation ROMs were 8.6 mm ± 3.0 mm, 28.4 mm ± 13.9 mm, and 20.4 mm ± 7.2 mm for medial-lateral, pistoning, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. Within-subject rotational and translational variability during gait averaged 2.8° and 2.0 mm or less, whereas the between-subject variability was up to 9.4° and 18.6 mm, which demonstrates residual femur motion relative to the socket is repeatable within subjects, but inconsistent across subjects during gait.

Alterations in structure and mechanical properties of the ankle plantarflexors and Achilles tendon are of particular interest due to their important 'catapult-like' function during efficient and healthy human locomotion. In this study, we examined age-related differences in the in vivo mechanical properties of both muscle and tendon in the human ankle plantarflexors in healthy younger (21 ± 3.25 years) and older (69 ± 2.86 years) adults. All participants were physically active, to represent healthy ageing. B-mode ultrasound coupled with force measurements was used to determine in vivo Achilles tendon stiffness and shear-wave elastography was used to measure shear modulus, an index of muscle stiffness, in the medial and lateral gastrocnemii. We found that older adults displayed 43% lower (p = 0.004) Achilles tendon stiffness, 59% lower (p < 0.001) Achilles tendon Young's modulus, and 34% greater (p = 0.002) Achilles tendon cross-sectional area compared to younger participants. We found no difference in the shear modulus of the medial or lateral gastrocnemii between the younger and older individuals. The reduction in Achilles tendon stiffness coupled with similar gastrocnemii muscle shear modulus likely influences the integrated neuromechanical function of the ankle plantarflexor muscle-tendon units during locomotor tasks.

When inappropriately performed, these actions can impose excessive mechanical loads at the lower limb joints, specifically at the knee and ankle joints, usually associated with increased risk of injury. This work aims to estimate muscle forces and muscle contributions to the acceleration of the center of mass during a rapid maximal single-leg forward braking and backward acceleration task. Fourteen elite male injury-free indoor-sports athletes participated in this work. Scaled generic musculoskeletal models, consisting of 12 segments, 23 degrees of freedom, and 92 muscle-tendon actuators were used in OpenSim software. Due to the nature of the musculoskeletal system, all muscles are considered when joint and segment positions, velocities, and accelerations are calculated, resulting in muscles acting to accelerate joints it does not span. The knowledge of muscle interaction during this multijoint task is important and was achieved through an induced acceleration analysis. The vasti (-9.18 ± 2.09 and -7.63 ± 1.33 N/Kg) were the main contributors to the centre of mass deceleration profile along the anterior/posterior direction, aided by the soleus muscle (9.72 ± 2.35 and 9.62 ± 2.07 N/Kg), which counteracted most of the effects applied by gravity along the vertical direction, during both phases.

Inter-individual comparisons of G usually require normalization by maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), but MVC procedures may not be appropriate for certain clinical populations including those presenting with pain or other compromised functionality. This study aimed to test whether muscle size-scaled G, which does not require MVC testing, would yield stronger correlation with absolute torque than unscaled G. Twelve-healthy males performed isometric elbow extension across a range of torque magnitudes (from 5 Nm until 60% MVC). G of the triceps brachii was measured using shear wave elastography during each trial. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) of the triceps brachii were measured at rest. Scaled G was calculated as a product of G and CSA or MT (""G-CSA"" and ""G-MT"", respectively). Within-individual linear regressions were conducted between absolute torque and the three force indicator variables. The regression slopes' coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each indicator across individuals. Between-individual correlation coefficients were calculated, after pooling all data across individuals into a single regression analysis for each indicator. Linear regression found that inter-individual slope variation increased in the following order: G-CSA, G-MT, and unscaled G (CV = 0.15, 0.18, and 0.29, respectively). Pooled-individual correlation coefficients were significantly higher in G-CSA and G-MT than in unscaled G (r = 0.948, 0.924, and r = 0.783, respectively).

Temporal coupling of anti-phase motion between the upper and lower body angular accelerations was assessed with magnitude squared coherence and cross-spectral phase angles. People with mTBI demonstrated greater sway than controls across conditions and directions.

However, previous models that could capture realistic crack paths in cortical bone were due to the required computational effort limited to idealized osteon geometries and small (<1 mm2) model domains. The objective of this study was therefore to bridge the gap between experimental and numerical analysis of crack propagation in cortical bone by introducing image-based models at the mesoscale. Tissue orientation maps from high-resolution micro-CT images were used to define the distribution and orientation of weak interfaces in the models. Crack propagation was simulated using the extended finite element method in combination with an interface damage model, previously developed to simulate crack propagation in microstructural osteon models. The results showed that image-based mesoscale models can be used to capture interactions between cracks and microstructure. The simulated crack paths predicted the general trends seen in experiments with more irregular patterns for cracks propagating perpendicular compared to parallel to the osteon orientation. In all, the proposed method enabled an efficient description of the tissue level microstructure, which is a necessity to predict realistic crack paths in cortical bone and is an important step towards simulating crack propagation in bone models in 3D.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to design a mechanical balancing device, which measures deflections resulting from forces applied on each condyle to provide numerical data indicating the extent of ligament release needed, or angular changes in the bone cuts required to achieve a balanced knee. Two mechanical devices were designed and 3D printed, Pistol Grip and In-line. The Pistol Grip design consisted of a lever system that indicated the difference between lateral and medial forces with a single pointer. The In-line design allows for the quantification of the absolute force applied on each individual condyle. The two designs were evaluated on a test rig designed to model balance and imbalance conditions in the knee. For the Pistol Grip design maximum pointer deflection indicates a 2 mm change in elevation per condyle and/or a 3 degrees angular change of the condyles which can be corrected by adjusting the ligament lengths equivalent to 2 mm and/or by modifying the proximal or distal femur bone cut by 3 degrees. For the In-line design, maximum pointer deflection represented a 40 N load on the condyle. Our mechanical balancer designs were successful in providing information that can guide surgeons to accurately achieve balance through ligamentous releases and/or modification to bone cuts. The balancer designs are easy to use, do not require any electronics or software, and can be incorporated into the surgical procedure.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Because cross bridge kinetics and titin isoforms, which are thought to be related to RFE, differ between muscles, the SSC effect may be also muscle-dependent. Thus, we compared the SSC effect between psoas and soleus muscles, which have a distinct fiber type distribution and different titin isoforms. Four tests (SSC, SSC control, RFE, RFE control) were conducted using isolated, skinned fibers of psoas and soleus. In the SSC tests, fibers were activated at an average sarcomere length of 2.4 μm, stretched to 3.0 μm, and shortened to 2.4 μm. In the SSC control tests, fibers were activated at an average sarcomere length of 3.0 μm and then shortened to 2.4 μm. The relative increase in mechanical work obtained during shortening between tests was defined as the SSC effect. In the RFE tests, fibers were activated at an average sarcomere length of 2.4 μm and then stretched to 3.0 μm, while the RFE control tests consisted of an isometric contraction at 3.0 μm. The difference in steady-state isometric force between tests was defined as RFE. The SSC effect was greater in soleus than in psoas, while the RFE was the same for both muscles. Since the SSC effect was greater in soleus, while the RFE was the same, the observed greater SSC effect is probably not directly caused by RFE, but may be related to differences in cross bridge kinetics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nineteen healthy participants aged 24-74 years underwent the same set of measurements on two separate occasions. Retroreflective markers were placed on anatomical regions, including C7, T1, T4, T5, T8, T9, T12 and L1 spinous processes, pelvis, upper and lower limbs, and head. We created full-body musculoskeletal models with detailed thoracolumbar spines, and scaled these to create subject-specific models for each individual and each session. Models were scaled from distances between markers, and spine curvature was adjusted according to marker-estimated measurements. Using these models, we estimated vertebral compressive loading for five different standardized postures: neutral standing, 45˚ trunk flexion, 15˚ trunk extension, 20˚ lateral bend to the right, and 45˚ axial rotation to the right. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement were calculated as measures of between-session reliability and measurement error, respectively. Spine curvature measures showed excellent reliability (ICC = 0.79-0.91) and body scaling segments showed fair to excellent reliability (ICC = 0.46-0.95). We found that musculoskeletal models showed mostly excellent between-session reliability to estimate spine loading, with 91% of ICC values > 0.75 for all activities. This information is a necessary precursor for using motion capture data to estimate spine loading from subject-specific musculoskeletal models, and suggests that marker data will deliver reproducible subject-specific models and estimates of spine loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Graft placements lead to an acute drop in compliance which effects cardiovascular risk and the development of graft related complications. A custom-made spring casing was applied to a Dacron graft segment under physiological pressure conditions within a five-element biventricular mock circulation loop, to investigate experimentally a concept to improve the compliance of a conventional aortic prosthesis by changing the transverse graft cross-section. Two different prosthesis locations, proximal and distal of compliant silicone tubing were used to study uniaxial graft compression with an elastic device. To characterise the devices' performance by means of pulse pressure (PP), diastolic pressure (Pdia) and pulse wave velocity(PWV), fluid pressures and flow were recorded. In a proximal graft setting (ascending aorta repair) elastic uniaxial compression with a custom-made spring casing (2 cm width) could significantly reduce PP by 10-14% (p < .001) and slowed PWV from 6.7 to 5.2 m/s (22%, p = .002). Applied to a graft in a distal position, the spring casing demonstrated less impact on PP (2-10%), but significantly reduced PWV in this mock aorta segment from 13.7 to 5.5 m/s (60%, p = .004). In conclusion, a newly conceptualised spring casing applied to the external wall of synthetic aortic grafts can reduce PP and slow PWV.

However, we were not able to investigate active muscle stiffness as more than 250 deg·s-1 due to the limitation of the torque motor of dynamometer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of angular velocities (including higher angular velocities of more than 250 deg·s-1) on active muscle stiffness. Eighteen males volunteered for this study. Active muscle stiffness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle was calculated according to changes in the estimated muscle force and fascicle length during fast lengthening at five different angular velocities (100, 200, 300, 500, and 600 deg·s-1). Electromyographic activities of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LG) and soleus muscle (SOL) were evaluated over two different phases: before the stretch (mEMGa) and after the stretch (mMEGb). Active muscle stiffness was higher at 300 than at 100 deg·s-1, but decreased as the angular velocity increased from 300 to 600 deg·s-1. There were no differences in mEMGa and mEMGb values among the five angular velocities, whereas mEMGb values were higher than mEMGa for all angular velocities. In conclusion, active muscle stiffness was highest at 300 deg·s-1 and decreased at both slower and faster angular velocities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized a greater increase in muscle PCSA after training with lower lengthening velocities and a greater increase in fascicle length after higher lengthening velocities. Forty-seven young men were randomly assigned to either a control (n = 14) or an intervention group (n = 33). The participants of the intervention group were randomly allocated to one of four isokinetic eccentric training protocols of the knee extensors, with four different knee angular velocities (45°/s, 120°/s, 210°/s and 300°/s), yet similar range of motion (25-100° knee joint angle), load magnitude (100% of isometric maximum) and load volume (i.e. similar time under tension for one training set). Before and after an 11-week training period with 3 times per week exercise, muscle volume, pennation angle, fascicle length and PCSA of the VL muscle were measured using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. After the training, the VL muscle volume and fascicle length increased similarly and approximately 5% in all investigated protocols. The PCSA and pennation angles of the VL did not change after any exercise protocol, indicating negligible radial muscle adaptation after the training. The reason for the found hypertrophy of VL muscle after eccentric training in a wide range of lengthening velocities was mainly a longitudinal muscle growth. Further, the longitudinal muscle growth was independent of the lengthening velocity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Quantification of TMJ kinematics is clinically relevant in cases of prosthetic rehabilitations, TMJ disorders, osteoarthritis, trauma, tumour resection and congenital abnormalities, which are known to directly influence mandibular motion and loading. The objective of this systematic review was to critically investigate published literature on historic and contemporary measurement modalities used to quantify in vivo mandibular and TMJ kinematics in six degrees of freedom. The electronic databases of Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Embase and Central were searched and 109 relevant articles identified. Publication quality was documented using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Axiography and ultrasonic tracking are commonly employed in the clinical setting due to their simplicity and capacity to rapidly acquire low-fidelity mandibular motion data. Magnetic and optoelectronic tracking have been used in combination with dental splints to produce higher accuracy measurements while minimising skin motion artefact, but at the expense of setup time and cost. Four-dimensional computed tomography provides direct 3D measurement of mandibular and TMJ motion while circumventing skin motion artefact entirely, but employs ionising radiation, is restricted to low sampling frequencies, and requires time-consuming image processing. Recent advances in magnetic tracking using miniature sensors adhered to the teeth in combination with intraoral scanning may facilitate rapid and high precision mandibular kinematics measurement in the clinical setting.

Numerous studies demonstrate that intracardiac fluid flow patterns in the embryonic and fetal circulation can impact cardiac structural formation and remodeling. This highlights the importance of quantifying the altered hemodynamic environment in congenital heart defects, like HLHS, relative to a normal heart as it relates to cardiac development. Therefore, to study human cardiovascular fetal flow, computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed using 4D patient-specific ultrasound scans in normal and HLHS hearts. In these simulations, we find that the HLHS right ventricle exhibits a greater cardiac output than normal; yet, hemodynamics are relatively similar between normal and HLHS right ventricles. Overall, this study provides detailed quantitative flow patterns for HLHS, which has the potential to guide future prevention and therapeutic interventions, while more immediately providing additional functional detail to cardiologists to aid in decision making.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

An ideal coupon geometry for tensile testing is a dumbbell shape (dog-bone), yet the cost and time required to fabricate custom steel punches to cut dumbbell-shaped coupons has hindered their universal application in biomechanics research. In this study, we developed an economical and reliable cutting device that can extract dumbbell-shaped coupons from soft biological tissue. The novel device, called Print-A-Punch, uses three-dimensional (3D) printed components in combination with standard fasteners and replaceable flexible razors. We identified design factors that influence the dimensional accuracy and symmetry of elastomer coupons extracted using this cutting device, and demonstrated its use on bovine meniscus. Advantages of this 3D printed device include a fast fabrication time, low material cost, good accuracy, replaceable blades, and an ability to scale coupon dimensions for specific tissues and experiments. By reducing the cost and time to cut accurate dumbbell-shaped coupons, this technology can facilitate the broad adoption of standard test methods that improve the quality and reproducibility of tensile tests in soft biological tissue.

Balancing in less challenging environments allows for flexibility in control, which may not depend on health status but instead may reflect personal preferences. To make assessment less ambiguous, trunk neuromuscular control should be maximally challenged. Thirty-four healthy subjects balanced on a robotic seat capable of adjusting rotational stiffness. Subjects balanced while rotational stiffness was gradually reduced. The rotational stiffness at which subjects could no longer maintain balance, defined as critical stiffness (kCrit), was used to quantify the subjects' trunk neuromuscular control. A higher kCrit reflects poorer control, as subjects require a more stable base to balance. Subjects were tested on three days separated by 24 hours to assess test-retest reliability. Anthropometric (height and weight) and demographic (age and sex) influences on kCrit and its reliability were assessed. Height and age did not affect kCrit; whereas, being heavier (p < 0.001) and female (p = 0.042) significantly increased kCrit. Reliability was also affected by anthropometric and demographic factors, highlighting the potential problem of inflated reliability estimates from non-control related attributes. kCrit measurements appear reliable even after removing anthropometric and demographic influences, with adjusted correlations of 0.612 (95%CI: 0.433-0.766) versus unadjusted correlations of 0.880 (95%CI: 0.797-0.932).

Various lifting analysis tools such as musculoskeletal models, regression equations and NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) lifting equation (NLE) have been proposed to evaluate and mitigate associated risks during manual material handling activities. Present study aims to compare predicted spinal loads from 5 different lifting analysis tools as well as to critically evaluate the NIOSH recommended weight limit (RWL). Spinal loads were estimated under different symmetric/asymmetric lifting tasks in which hand-load mass at each task was set based on RWL from NLE. Estimated intradiscal pressures (IDPs) of various tools were also compared with in vivo measurements. We compared RWL by NLE versus our estimations of RWL calculated from our regression equations using biomechanical criteria (compression <3400 N with/without shear <1000, 1250 or 1500 N). Our regression equations followed by OpenSim, AnyBody, simple polynomial and 3DSSPP satisfactorily predicted L4-L5 IDPs. Lifting analysis tools estimated comparable spinal compression forces (mean Pearson's r = 0.80; standard deviation of relative difference = 26%) while in shear, differences were greater (mean Pearson's r = 0.68; standard deviation of relative difference = 56%). NLE estimations of RWL were conservative in comparison with our estimations for lean individuals (BMI < 25 kg/m2) when compression <3400 N and shear <1250 N were considered as the biomechanical criteria. For heavier individuals, however, NLE estimations of RWL generated spinal compression >3400 N (NIOSH biomechanical safety threshold) as well as shear >1000 N. Although RWLs estimated by NLE was body weight independent, body weight substantially altered RWLs estimated from our regression equations.

This study aimed to evaluate the amount of collagen and biomechanics at different levels and segments of the aortic root. Ten aortic roots from healthy pigs were excised including the aortic annulus, the sinuses of Valsalva, and the sinotubular junction (STJ). Specimens were further divided into three circumferential segments; left coronary (LC)-, right coronary (RC)-, and non-coronary (NC) sinus. Collagen was determined using hydroxyproline analysis and specimens were tested biomechanically for stress-strain relations. The annulus showed significantly larger average maximum stiffness (9.6 ± 4.5 N/mm) compared with the sinus (4.5 ± 2.0 N/mm) and STJ (4.8 ± 1.8 N/mm). The average collagen content was likewise higher in the annulus (4.0 ± 1.0 mg/ml) compared with the sinus (2.4 ± 0.6 mg/ml) and STJ (2.2 ± 0.5 mg/ml) for all three segments. The NC sinus segment exhibited a significantly larger maximum stiffness and stress under static conditions compared with the RC. These results suggest that the aortic root is heterogeneous in both structure and biomechanical properties and that it varies both in levels and segments of the aortic root. Future surgical approaches should consider enhanced strength parameters for specific areas of the aortic root to achieve the best results when performing aortic valve-sparing techniques. From this study, we conclude that the aortic annulus needs special attention to imitate normal physiologic properties during aortic valve-sparing surgery due to its higher maximum stiffness, stress, and load.

The Microsoft Kinect™ sensor is, in this regard, advantageous over the traditional skin-marker-based optical motion capture systems for being marker-less, portable, cost-effective, and easy-to-use in real workplaces. While several studies have demonstrated the validity/reliability of the Kinect for posture measurements especially during gait trials, its capability to adequately drive a detailed spine musculoskeletal model for injury risk assessments remains to be investigated. Lumbosacral (L5-S1) load predictions of a Kinect-driven and a gold-standard marker-based Vicon-driven musculoskeletal model were compared for various standing static load-handling activities at different heights/asymmetry angles/distances. Full body kinematics of eight individuals each performing eighteen activities were simultaneously recorded by a single-front-placed Kinect and a 10-camera Vicon motion capture system and input to AnyBody Modeling System. The predicted spinal loads by the two models were in average different by 17.8 and 25.9% for the L5-S1 disc compressive and shear forces, respectively, with smaller errors for the activities at higher load heights. Some activities performed near the floor could, however, not be recorded by a single-front-placed Kinect sensor due to the joint occlusion. The capability of the Kinect to adequately drive a spine musculoskeletal model depended on the complexity of the activity.

To this end, in this study, we developed a three-dimensional multiscale finite element model that linked submicroscale models of MCF networks to microscale models of several lamellae. The developed models evaluated the individual and relative influence of MCF orientation as well as material property variation due to MCF mineral distribution and interaction on the lamellar scale mechanical response of bone. The simulation results showed that the elastic modulus, ultimate strength, and fracture energy at the lamellar scale decreased as the angle between the main axis of MCFs and loading direction increased. The heterogeneity in mineral distribution along MCFs did not lead to a significant difference in the mechanical behavior at the lamellar scale compared to the material property heterogeneity introduced in the models due to MCF orientation variation. Variation in the interaction between MCFs at the submicroscale had a substantial influence on the lamellar scale mechanical properties. In summary, this study established a multiscale model that linked MCFs to lamellae providing the capability of quantifying the relative influence of modifications in material and organizational properties of MCFs due to age, diseases, and treatments on the fracture processes at the lamellar length scale.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

 Continuous positive airway pressure is the most effective long-term treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea, which is a sleeping disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. It introduces pressurized atmospheric air into the respiratory system in order to maintain open airways without blockage. Some continuous positive airway pressure devices incorporate a convective heat transfer humidifier to overcome dryness. However, many side effects, including the unacceptable excess of water droplets in the air supply line, have been reported and improvements are essential for better patient’s comfort and acceptance of the therapy. The excess of water droplets is attributed to the qualitative rather than the quantitative approach of determining the rise in temperature and humidity of the inspired air. Therefore, a human upper airway mathematical model is developed to predict the heat and water transfer variation between normal breathing and continuous positive airway pressure conditions and determine the optimal input temperature and relative humidity in the continuous positive airway pressure humidifier.

This work aimed to evaluate and quantify the effects of HFNC flowrate and gas type on airway pressures measured in vitro in infant airway replicas. Ten realistic infant airway replicas, extending from nares to trachea, were connected in turn to a lung simulator and were supplied gas flows through HFNC. Air and heliox were each provided at two weight-indexed flowrates, 1 l/min/kg and 2 l/min/kg. Pressure and lung volume were continuously measured during simulated breathing. For constant simulated patient effort, no statistically significant change in tidal volume was measured between baseline and lower or higher HFNC flowrates, nor was there any significant difference in tidal volume between air and heliox. Tracheal pressure increased with increasing HFNC flow rate, and was highly variable between airway replicas. Higher pressures were measured for air versus heliox. For air supplied at 2 l/min/kg, average airway pressures in excess of 4 cm H2O were generated, with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ranging from 2.5 to nearly 12 cm H2O across the replicas. A predictive correlation for PEEP was proposed based on supplied gas density and flow velocities exiting the cannula and nares, and was able to account for a portion of variability between airway replicas (R2 = 0.913). Additionally, PEEP was well correlated with, and predictive of, expiratory peak pressure (R2 = 0.939) and average inspiratory pressure (R2 = 0.944).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While it has been shown that isolated nuclei can adapt to applied force ex vivo, the mechanisms governing nuclear mechanoadaptation in response to physiologic forces in vivo remain unclear. To investigate nuclear mechanoadaptation in cells, we developed an atomic force microscopy (AFM) based procedure to probe live nuclei isolated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) following the application of low intensity vibration (LIV) to determine whether nuclear stiffness increases as a result of LIV. Results indicated that isolated nuclei were, on average, 30% softer than nuclei tested within intact MSCs prior to LIV.

LIV-induced nuclear stiffening required functional Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, but was not accompanied by increased levels of the nuclear envelope proteins LaminA/C or Sun-2. While depleting LaminA/C or Sun-1&2 resulted in either a 47% or 39% increased heterochromatin to nuclear area ratio in isolated nuclei, the heterochromatin to nuclear area ratio was decreased by 25% in LIV-treated nuclei compared to controls, indicating LIV-induced changes in the heterochromatin structure. Overall, our findings indicate that increased apparent cell stiffness in response to exogenous mechanical challenge of MSCs in the form of LIV is in part retained by increased nuclear stiffness and changes in heterochromatin structure.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The use of different perturbation methods may produce method-specific balance-correcting responses. This study evaluated balance-correcting responses induced with platform-translation and shoulder-pull methods with equilibrated perturbation intensities, and whether the absence of vision affects balance-correcting responses differently between perturbation methods. Fifteen healthy young males participated. Unexpected forward and backward platform-translation and shoulder-pull perturbations were induced with eyes-open and eyes-closed. Participants were asked to behave naturally. Forward stepping trials were analyzed. Margin of stability (MOS) was calculated from the position data of reflective markers placed strategically around the body. MOS was reported at step onset and at foot contact. MOS was smaller at step onset (0.01 ± 0.01 m) and at foot contact (0.09 ± 0.01 m) during platform-translation trials and at both time points during shoulder-pull trials (0.04 ± 0.01 m and 0.17 ± 0.01 m, respectively). The absence of vision did not affect MOS at step onset. At foot contact during platform-translation with eyes-closed MOS was larger (0.11 ± 0.01 m) than with eyes-open (0.08 ± 0.01 m), but not different between eyes-open (0.17 ± 0.01 m) and eyes-closed (0.18 ± 0.01 m) during shoulder-pull. Participants required a second step to recover balance in 14% of the platform-translation and 3% of the shoulder-pull trials. During platform-translation trials participants demonstrated smaller MOS which placed them in a less favorable circumstance for balance recovery. Platform-translation appears to be more challenging than shoulder-pull perturbation in terms of balance recovery. This study underscores that caution is required when interpreting results of studies utilizing different perturbation paradigms.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using biplane fluoroscopic imaging, we investigated the ranges of motion (ROMs) of the three joints in the cervical spines (from C3 to C7) of eighteen asymptomatic subjects. Three functional neck motions were examined, including flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB) and axial twisting (AT). Our measurements showed that the translations of both IVD and FJs primarily occurred in the sagittal plane during all neck motions, and the anteroposterior translations of IVDs were significantly smaller than those of the corresponding FJs (p < 0.05) at all segments. For example, the ranges of IVD and FJ anteroposterior translations at C3/4 were 2.7 ± 0.7 mm vs. 3.5 ± 1.1 mm in FE, 0.9 ± 0.5 mm vs. 4.6 ± 1.1 mm in LB, and 1.0 ± 0.5 mm vs. 3.1 ± 1.0 mm in AT. Furthermore, we introduced an IVD-FJ translation ratio, which represents the ratio of the IVD to FJ translational ROMs. In FE neck motion, the IVD-FJ anteroposterior translation ratios decreased from 0.81 ± 0.18 at C3 to 0.52 ± 0.19 at C3, indicating gradually increasing resistances of IVDs compared to FJs from the proximal to distal levels. In LB neck motion, the smallest IVD-FJ translation ratios (0.14 ± 0.09 and 0.43 ± 0.30) occurred at C4/5 for both anteroposterior and left-right translations. In AT neck motion, the largest IVD-FJ anteroposterior translation ratio (0.42 ± 0.21) occurred at C3/4, and was significantly different from those at C4/5 and C5/6 (p < 0.05).

So far, interventions focused on reducing the peak knee adduction moment (pKAM) and it remains unclear if this can be done individually without increasing the peak knee flexion moment (pKFM). Additionally, while modifying foot progression angle (FPA) and step width (SW) is common, little is known about modifications in stride length (SL). This study aimed at characterizing the feasibility of a dual kinetic change, consisting in reducing the pKAM by at least 10% without increasing the pKFM. It also aimed to evaluate the added value of SL modifications in achieving the dual kinetic change. Gait trials with modifications in FPA, SW and SL were recorded for 11 young healthy subjects in a laboratory equipped with an augmented-reality system displaying instruction footprints on the floor. All participants achieved the dual kinetic change with at least one of the modifications. Seven participants achieved it with FPA modification, three with SW modification, and seven with SL modification. In conclusion, this study showed that it is feasible to achieve the dual kinetic change individually through subject-specific modifications in footprint parameters, suggesting that, in the future, gait retraining could aim for more specific kinetic changes than simply pKAM reductions. Modifying SL allowed achieving the dual kinetic change, stressing out the value of this parameter for gait retraining, in addition to FPA and SW. Finally, an augmented-reality approach was introduced to help footprint parameter modifications in the framework of knee OA.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of the study is to carry out the cardiac mechanics analysis to show the changes of left ventricular (LV) wall stresses after LV hypertrophy (LVH) and myocardial infarction (MI). Here, LVH and MI were generated in rabbit hearts through the transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and the distal left circumflex (LCx) artery ligation operations, respectively. Physiological and CT measurements were carried out at postoperative 2 and 4 weeks, based on which a finite element (FE) model was developed to perform the mechanics computation. We found a gradual increase of end-diastolic myofiber stress in free wall and interventricular septum of LVH and MI (higher stress in the free wall than the septum).

In this study we uncover the underlying mechanism of such behaviour; high levels of in-plane compaction occurs due to increasing tension in strain-stiffening fibres, leading to unphysical out-of-plane expansion. We demonstrate that auxetic behaviour is primarily influenced by the ratio of fibre to matrix stiffness, and is accentuated by strain-stiffening fibres in a constant stiffness matrix (e.g., the widely used neo-Hookean matrix with exponentially stiffening fibres). We propose a new bilinear strain stiffening fibre and matrix (BLFM) model which allows close control of the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio, thereby robustly eliminating auxetic behaviour. We demonstrate that our model provides accurate prediction of experimentally observed out-of-plane compaction, in addition to stress-stretch anisotropy, for arterial tissue subjected to uniaxial tension testing.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Force plate derived center of pressure (CoPpos) and vertical force (vGRF) may provide valuable information regarding limb and joint loading impairments in this group. This study aimed to determine the: 1) relationship between measures CoPpos and intra-limb extensor moment distribution during a squat, and 2) utility of using CoPpos and vGRF to estimate knee extensor moment deficits post-ACLr. Twenty-four individuals, 142 ± 22.5 days post-ACLr, performed bilateral squats. Ankle (aEXT), knee (kEXT) and hip (hEXT) extensor moments were calculated using three-dimensional kinematics and GRF. Moments, CoPpos and vGRF were identified at peak kEXT. Intra-limb moment distribution was characterized using hEXT/kEXT and aEXT/kEXT ratios. Linear regressions analyzed relationships between CoPpos and hEXT/kEXT and aEXT/kEXT. Stepwise regressions determined if between-limb CoPpos ratio predicted between-limb ratios of hEXT/kEXT and aEXT/kEXT. Stepwise regression determined if between-limb CoPpos and vGRF ratios predicted between-limb kEXT ratio. Results found that CoPpos predicts intra-limb moment distribution (hEXT/kEXT and aEXT/kEXT); more anterior CoPpos related to higher moments at the hip and ankle relative to the knee. In addition, between-limb CoPpos ratio predicts between-limb ratio of hEXT/kEXT and aEXT/kEXT ratios. Together between-limb CoPpos (52%) and vGRF (18%) ratios explained 70% of the variance in between-limb kEXT ratios (R2 = 0.70, p < 0.001).

Osteoarthritis is a disease associated with progressive changes in the tissue structure which affects mechanical properties of the tissue. Experimental studies show that abnormal/excessive mechanical loading or changes in biochemical composition can alter the structure which leads to degradation and loss of stiffness. In this study, deformation-induced degradation of human knee articular cartilage is investigated by conducting excessive deformations and inspecting progressive changes in mechanical properties of the tissue. Evolution of the properties is formulated to predict the amount of damage and consequently to connect the loss of stiffness to the grade of osteoarthritis. It is shown that, for tensile strains up to almost 15%, the tissue may recover its initial properties without permanent damage but for higher deformations degradation is expected. The proposed model is not confined to tension as the evolution laws are expressed in a 3D framework. The model predicts higher thresholds for compression and shear (25-30%) which is in good correlation with experimental investigations. It is concluded that, modelling the alterations of mechanical properties can be an effective method for predicting degradation of the AC under excessive loading and its connection to the associated diseases.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the most prevalent cell type in the artery wall, but it is unclear how much of the vessel nonlinearity is attributable to VSMCs. Here, we used cellular microbiaxial stretching (CμBS) to measure the large-strain mechanical properties of individual VSMCs. We find that the mechanical properties of VSMCs with native-like architectures are highly anisotropic, due to their highly aligned actomyosin cytoskeletons, and that inhibition of actomyosin contraction with rho-associated kinase inhibitor HA-1077 results in nearly isotropic material properties. We further find that when VSMCS are exposed to large strains (up to 60% stretch), the cells' stress-strain behavior is surprisingly linear. Finally, we modified a previously published Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden type strain energy density function to characterize individual VSMCs, to account for the observed large-deformation linearity.

The numerical simulation of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a typical biomechanical simulation process based on the LPM of blood circulatory system. In order to simulate patient-specific hemodynamic effects of EECP and develop best treatment strategy for each individual, this study developed an optimization algorithm to individualize LPM elements. Physiological data from 30 volunteers including approximate aortic pressure, cardiac output, ankle pressure and carotid artery flow were clinically collected as optimization objectives. A closed-loop LPM was established for the simulation of blood circulatory system. Aiming at clinical data, a sensitivity analysis for each element was conducted to identify the significant ones. We improved the traditional simulated annealing algorithm to iteratively optimize the sensitive elements. To verify the accuracy of the patient-specific model, 30 samples of simulated data were compared with clinical measurements. In addition, an EECP experiment was conducted on a volunteer to verify the applicability of the optimized model for the simulation of EECP. For these 30 samples, the optimization results show a slight difference between clinical data and simulated data. The average relative root mean square error is lower than 5%. For the subject of EECP experiment, the relative error of hemodynamic responses during EECP is lower than 10%. This slight error demonstrated a good state of optimization.

The quantification of thrombus permeability is challenging since it cannot be directly measured nor derived from radiological imaging data. As a proxy of thrombus permeability, thrombus perviousness has been introduced, which assesses the amount of contrast agent that has penetrated the thrombus on single-phase computed tomography angiography (CTA). We present a method to assess thrombus permeability rather than perviousness. We follow a three-step approach: (1) we propose a theoretical channel-like structure model describing the thrombus morphology. Using Darcy's law, we provide an analytical description of the permeability for this model. According to the channel-like model, permeability depends on the number of channels in the thrombus, the radius of the occluded artery, and the void fraction representing the volume available for the blood to flow; (2) we measure intra-thrombus blood flow and velocity on dynamic CTA; and (3) we combine the analytical model with the dynamic CTA measurements to estimate thrombus permeability. Analysis of dynamic CTA data from 49 AIS patients showed that the median blood velocity in the thrombus was 0.58 (IQR 0.26-1.35) cm/s. The median flow within the thrombus was 3.48 · 10-3 (IQR 1.71 · 10-3-9.21 · 10-3) ml/s. Thrombus permeability was of the order of 10-3-10-5 mm2, depending on the number of channels in the thrombus.

Twenty women performed treadmill walking (5 km/h) and running (7 and 10 km/h) combining different footwear (barefoot, minimalist, and traditional) and breast support conditions (bare breast, everyday bra, and sports bra). Three-dimensional data from breast and trunk markers were tracked for 10 stride cycles. Relative breast displacement was calculated and derived for velocity. An interaction effect was observed between support, footwear, and speed conditions. The bare breast conditions presented differences from the other conditions in the majority of the kinematic variables, presenting higher breast displacement and velocity values. On the other hand, the sports bra conditions presented the lowest values for the kinematics variables. In the vertical component of breast displacement during running (10 km/h) we verified that the sports bra presented reductions of 56% and 43% in relation to the bare breast and everyday bra conditions, respectively.

Such model, not available for pelvic artefacts, could allow pelvic STA compensation in routine gait analysis by embedding it in skeletal kinematics estimators and developing ad-hoc optimization problems for the estimate of subject-specific model parameters. It was developed as driven by adjacent body segment kinematics. Model architecture feasibility was tested; its compensation effectiveness was assessed evaluating the error in pelvic orientation after removing the modelled artefact from the measured one. Five volunteers with a wide body mass range (BMI: 22-37) underwent MRI scans to reconstruct subject-specific pelvic digital bone models. Multiple anatomical calibrations performed in different static postures, as occurring during walking and star-arc movements, registering the bone-models with points digitized through stereophotogrammetry over pelvic bony prominences, allowed to define the relevant poses of a pelvis-embedded anatomical coordinate system. Such approach allowed to measure STAs over several pelvic anatomical landmarks, for each posture and subject. Model parameters were estimated by minimizing the least squares difference between measured and modelled STAs. The measured STAs were appropriately modelled with subject-specific calibrations, both in terms of shape (correlation coefficient: median [inter-quartile-range]: 0.72 [0.36]) and amplitude (root mean square residual: 3.0 [3.2] mm).

This demographic is also the population that most frequently receives devices such as hip implants. However, high porosity complicates surgery and reduces the fixation and effectiveness of orthopaedic devices, which are typically designed using cadaveric specimens from the general population. Synthetic bones are also used in the design of such devices but need to represent the properties of the patient population. Thus, the mechanical response of two iterations of novel synthetic femurs were evaluated for their ability to represent osteoporotic cadaveric specimens and were tested and compared against cadaveric specimens across four loading modes. The first iteration had reduced density and wall thickness compared to standard models and was typically too rigid or too stiff to be a feasible alternative to cadaveric specimens. The second iteration, with similarly reduced wall thickness and further reduced density, was quite representative, with no statistical differences identified against the cadaveric specimens in any loading mode, except in screw pullout. Such a model can provide a foundation for the development of orthopaedic devices better suited to osteoporotic bone, potentially improving surgical outcomes, reducing medical expense, and improving quality of life for patients.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Initial contact (IC) detection for each gait cycle obtained from the GRF is used for calculating temporal gait parameters (e.g., gait variability, step time, stride time). Occasionally, the participant steps with one leg on the contralateral belt (i.e., crossing) making the IC undetectable and the calculation of temporal gait parameters are compromised. We term this the double-belt problem (DBP).


OBJECTIVE
here we developed a complementary detection method using the loading response peak (LRP), anchor point for calculating gait parameters.


METHODS
we used GRF gait data from twenty adults (age 56.45 ± 4.81 y; 6 males) who walked on an SBTM. First, we used no-crossing gait periods free of the DBP to calculate stride time, step time, and stride time to stride time coefficient of variation and evaluated the true error and the normalized true error of the LRP detection method. Then, we used multiple comparisons between no-crossing data and crossing data.


RESULTS
we found that normalized errors (in comparison to the IC method) are ≤5.1%. Strong correlations were found between gait parameters computed based on the two detection methods (Intraclass correlation coefficient ≥0.97; p ≤ 0.001).

detecting gait cycle timing based on the LRP detection method is reliable for estimating temporal gait parameters, demonstrating high correspondence with the gold standard IC detection method.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Repetitive active neck movements (flexion-extension, bilateral lateral flexion and bilateral rotation) were performed at different speeds, either at full range of motion (RoM) or restricted to 45° RoM at baseline, pre-exercise (T0), immediately following eccentric neck exercise (T1), 24 h (T2) and 48 h post-exercise (T3). The mean distance (MD) and mean angle (MA) parameters of the helical axis were extracted to quantify movement variability. MD, measured during movements performed at full RoM, reduced significantly at T2 compared to T0 (P = 0.001) regardless of direction or speed of movement. MA was significantly lower at T2 and T3 compared to T1 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.033, respectively). When RoM was restricted to 45°, significantly lower MD values were observed at T3 compared to T1 (P = 0.034), and significantly lower MA values were measured at T3 compared to T0, T1 and T2 (all P < 0.0001). This study uniquely demonstrates that neck movement variability is reduced immediately after, 24 h and 48 h after eccentric exercise, indicating that acute neck muscle soreness modifies the quality of neck movement.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Electromyography (EMG) analyses in PFP patients are usually performed individually for each muscle. However, several studies suggest that the central nervous system may modulate neural commands directed to groups of co-activated muscles, called muscle synergies. Investigating the synergistic organization in PFP will advance our knowledge of the influence of pain on muscle coordination. This study aimed to compare the motor coordination between women with and without PFP during the lateral step down (LSD). 15 women with PFP and 14 asymptomatic women underwent three-dimensional kinematics and EMG assessment during LSD. The Movement Deviation Profile (MDP) was calculated from kinematic data. Muscle synergies were extracted from EMG data of eight lower limb muscles using a non-negative factorization algorithm. Results revealed differences in MDP and an altered synergistic control between women with PFP and asymptomatic while performing the same motor gesture. Particularly, the variability accounted for (VAF) when using 3 synergies to reconstruct EMGs of the PFP group was higher than in the control group, suggesting reduced complexity of motor control in PFP. Detailed synergy analyses highlighted specific differences between groups in vastii and rectus femoris, which are muscles with a crucial role during the squat phase and the transition to rise phase of the LSD. This study shows the ability of muscle synergies analysis to reveal impaired motor coordination in PFP patients, and has the potential to be explored as a complementary tool to current clinical assessment techniques.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that weakening the appropriately chosen muscles on the concave side can decelerate AIS deformity progression. Muscle forces and reaction loads were estimated by an optimization-driven musculoskeletal (MS) model of adolescents with a normal- and an AIS trunk, and then applied on the finite element model of GPs of L1 through L4. Different set patterns of 95% reduction in the strength of the concave-side longissimus thoracis pars thoracic (LGPT), multifidus lumborum (MFL), and LGPT + MFL muscles were performed in the MS models. Results of this study showed that weakening of the concave-side MFL and LGPT muscles rendered a 35% correction in the symptomatic axial rotation of the AIS spine, and a reduction of about 25% in the compressive von Mises stress on the concave side of GPs, respectively, which can decelerate the deformity progression. It was observed that unilateral muscle weakening caused a compensatory activation of the rest of muscles to retain the spine stability. The intradiscal pressures and ratio between the rotations toward either side of the scoliotic spine, found here, matched well with some recent in-vivo investigations. One of the applications of the stability-based MS model of AIS spine with unilaterally weakened muscles presented in this study is to optimize the performance of the currently used braces. To fortify the presented therapeutic approach, experiments should be done on scoliotic animals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A safe sleep product design perspective.,"The design of inclined sleep products may be associated with an increased risk of suffocation when an infant finds themselves prone in the product. It is important to understand how different inclined sleep surface angles impact infants' muscle activity when considering a safe sleep environment. The purpose of this study was to assess muscle activity of healthy infants when they lie supine and prone on different inclined crib mattress surfaces (0° vs. 10° vs. 20°). Fifteen healthy infants were recruited for this study. Surface EMG was recorded from cervical paraspinal, abdominal, lumbar erector spinae, and triceps muscles for 60 s during supine and prone positioning. Repeated measures ANOVAs and Bonferroni post-hoc adjustments were performed to test the effect of incline angles. Paired t-tests were performed to test the effect of position (supine vs. prone). During prone lying, abdominal muscle activity increased by 33% and 71% for 10° and 20° compared to 0°, while erector spinae and triceps muscle activity decreased for 20° compared to 0°. Lumbar erector spinae and cervical paraspinal muscle activity increased by 185% and 283% for prone compared to supine lying. During prone positioning, the 20° inclined surface resulted in significantly higher muscle activity of the trunk core muscles (abdominals), which may exacerbate fatigue and contribute to suffocation if an infant cannot self-correct to the supine position. Compared to supine positioning, prone lying requires higher musculoskeletal effort to maintain a safe posture to prevent suffocation, and babies likely fatigue faster when lying prone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As such, large excursions of the trunk during controlled activities are believed to be the result of poor trunk control. Here, we show that the axial torque actively induces the trunk axial rotation (the thoracic rotation relative to the pelvis) rather than minimise the axial rotation during sidestep cutting. We analysed the kinematic and kinetic data of 90° sidestep cutting with maximal effort by 10 physically active men. The thorax rotated toward the objective direction prior to the pelvis, resulting in the trunk axial rotation with the peak angle of 21.0 ± 6.0°. Lumbosacral axial torque was exerted toward the objective direction during the early stance phase, and it was then exerted inversely during the late stance and flight phases, which was consistent with the increase/decrease in the trunk axial rotation velocity. In the early stance phase, the absolute integrated component of the lumbosacral axial torque for pelvic rotation (0.074 ± 0.033 Nms/kg) was significantly larger than any other integrated component. In the late stance and flight phases, the lumbosacral axial torque mainly rotated the pelvis. The results indicate that the axial torque is exerted to actively induce the trunk axial rotation rather than minimise the trunk movement, suggesting that the trunk control concept probably should include not only stabilising but also actively moving the trunk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Recent studies have identified two unique regions within the PDL, the 'dense collar' region and the 'furcation' region, which exhibit distinct structural and compositional differences. However, specific functional differences between these regions have yet to be investigated. We adapted an AFM-based nanoscale rheology method to regionally assess mechanical properties and poroelasticity in the mouse PDL while minimizing the disruption of the 3-dimensional native boundary conditions, and then explored tissue mechanical function in four different regions within the dense collar as well as in the furcation region. We found significant differences between the collar and furcation regions, with the collar acting as a stabilizing ligamentous structure and the furcation acting as both a compressive cushion for vertical forces and a conduit for nutrient transport. While this finding supports our hypothesis, based on previous studies investigating structural and compositional differences, we also found surprising inhomogeneity within the collar region itself. This inhomogeneity supports previous findings of a tilting movement in the buccal direction of mandibular molar teeth and the structural adaptation to prevent lingual movement. Future work will aim to understand how different regions of the PDL change functionally during biological or mechanical perturbations, such as orthodontic tooth movement, development, or aging, with the ultimate goal of better understanding the mechanobiology of the PDL function in health and disease.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It was recently shown in the Biomechanics literature that Cardan angles inaccurately estimate true mean attitude due to an important mathematical inadequacy: attitude under-representation; at least four quantities are needed to unambiguously specify attitude. Directional statistics, which is the multivariate generalization of (univariate) circular statistics, solves this problem using four-dimensional unit vectors and the mathematics of hyperspherical geometry. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of directional analysis to the results of uni- and multi-variate Cardan analysis for representative joint kinematic data during gait. We analyzed hip, knee and pelvis data from three open datasets and report exemplary results for knee kinematics in v-cut vs. side shuffle tasks. We also conducted Monte Carlo simulations, using synthetic data with precisely controlled true angular effects, to systematically compare directional and Cardan analyses. Results show that directional analysis yielded considerably smaller p values (p<0.03) than Cardan analysis (p>0.055) for the exemplary dataset. Simulation results confirmed that directional analysis is considerably more powerful (i.e., much more able to detect true angular effects) than both uni- and multi-variate Cardan analysis. These results suggest that directional statistics should be used to analyse attitude, including 3D joint kinematics, to avoid false negatives.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigated the immediate and prolonged effects of wearing body armor on timing aspect of lumbo-pelvic coordination during the toe-touch (TT) and two-legged-squat (TLS) tests. A cross-over study design was used wherein twelve asymptomatic and gender-balanced individuals completed two experimental sessions with and without body armor. A session included two similar sets of tests, before and after exposure to a treadmill walk, containing a TT and a TLS test with ten cycles of fast bending and return. Reflective markers were attached on the participants to capture the kinematics of body segments in conjunction with a motion capture system. The mean absolute relative phase (MARP) and deviation phase (DP) between the thorax and pelvis were calculated for each test. The pre-walk MARP in the return was significantly larger with versus without body armor (p = 0.022), while there were no significant effects of body armor on the other outcome measures. In addition, the pre-walk MARP and DP in the bending and return, as well as the walk-induced changes in the MARP in the bending phase were significantly larger in TLS versus TT (p < 0.026). Therefore, using a body armor immediately made the lumbo-pelvic coordination less in-phase during return, but no prolonged effects were found. Further investigation is necessary to specify chances wearing a body armor increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries in the lower back and lower extremities joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Perturbations make the athlete unbalanced or at loss of control, which ultimately can lead to injury. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in ACL agonist and antagonist muscle forces, between sexes, during unexpected perturbations. Twenty recreational athletes were perturbed during walking at a speed of 1.1 m/s. Motion analysis data were used to create subject-specific musculoskeletal models and static optimization was performed to calculate muscle forces in OpenSim. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to compare muscle forces between males and females during the stance phase of the perturbed cycle. Females illustrated higher ACL antagonist muscle forces (p < 0.05) and lower ACL agonist muscle forces, compared to their male counterparts. The quadriceps (QUADs) muscle group peak was about 1.4 times higher in females (35.50 ± 8.71 N/kg) than males (22.81 ± 5.83 N/kg during 57%-62% of the stance phase (p < 0.05). Females presented a larger peak of gastrocnemius (GAS) at two instances: 12.42 ± 4.5 N/kg vs. 8.10 ± 2.83 N/kg between 70% and 75% at p < 0.05 and 2.26 ± 0.55 N/kg vs. 0.52 ± 0.09 N/kg between 95% and 100% at p < 0.05. Conversely, males illustrated higher initial hamstrings (HAMS) peak of 10.67 ± 4.15 N/kg vs. 5.38 ± 1.1 N/kg between 8% and 11%. Finally, males showed almost double the soleus (SOL) peak at 30.63 ± 8.64 N/kg vs. 17.52 ± 3.62 N/kg between 83% and 92% of the stance phase at p < 0.001.

Microcracks are associated with bone resorption and may also play an important role in root resorption. This study aimed to assess the occurrence of microcracks on the root surface induced by orthodontic force, analyze the association between force and microcrack development, and propose potential measures to reduce microcracks. Different loads (0.5, 1, or 2 N) were applied between the left first molar and anterior teeth for different durations (1, 3, 7, or 14 days) in a rabbit model. The first molar was dissected and its surface was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed the presence of microcracks on the compressed side of the root apices. The number, width, and length of microcracks were all positively correlated with the load magnitude and duration. The breaking strength of the root apex was tested by using a digital force tester. In addition, a finite element (FE) model was used to analyze the stress at the root apices and the crack propagation on the root surfaces. FE analysis calculated that the regions of maximum stress at the root apices were consistent with the microcrack regions observed via SEM. These results imply that orthodontic force can directly induce the occurrence and development of microcrack, and may contribute to further root resorption. Therefore, an appropriate interval and direction of orthodontic force may help reduce microcracks and prevent root resorption.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Until now, however, the assessment of functional kinematics in healthy knees has been mostly restricted to the loaded stance phase of gait, and level walking only, but the most critical conditions for the surrounding soft tissues are known to occur during high-flexion activities. This study aimed to determine the ranges of tibio-femoral rotation and condylar translation as well as provide evidence on the location of the centre of rotation during multiple complete cycles of different gait activities. Based on radiographic images captured using moving fluoroscopy in ten healthy subjects during multiple cycles of level walking, downhill walking and stair descent, 3D femoral and tibial poses were reconstructed to provide a comprehensive description of tibio-femoral kinematics. Despite a significant increase in joint flexion, the condylar antero-posterior range of motion remained comparable across all activities, with mean translations of 6.3-8.3 mm and 7.3-9.3 mm for the medial and lateral condyles respectively. Only the swing phase of level walking and stair descent exhibited a significantly greater range of motion for the lateral over the medial compartment. Although intra-subject variability was low, considerable differences in joint kinematics were observed between subjects. The observed subject-specific movement patterns indicate that accurate assessment of individual pre-operative kinematics together with individual implant selection and/or surgical implantation decisions might be necessary before further improvement to joint replacement outcome can be achieved.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Our study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the RFD-SF in dynamic drop jump (DJ) task (RFD-SFDJ). A total of 55 young athletes performed isometric plantarflexion at different submaximal intensities and 60 DJs (6 different drop heights). For each participant we calculated linearity (r2) and slope in isometric task (RFD-SFPF), eccentric part of DJ (RFD-SFDJ-ECC) and concentric part of DJ (RFD-SFDJ-CON), as well as average jump height (DJH) from each drop height. Our results revealed strong linear force-RFD relationship for isometric plantarflexion (r2 = 0.90 ± 0.06), eccentric (r2 = 0.87 ± 0.09) and concentric phase of DJ (r2 = 0.80 ± 0.18). Significant moderate positive correlations were calculated between RFD-SFPF and RFD-SFDJ-ECC (r = 0.311, p < 0.05) and small negative correlations between RFD-SFDJ-CON and RFD-SF (r = -0.276, p < 0.05).

This is the first study to introduce and confirm that RFD-SFDJ can be obtained from the multi-joint tasks (60 jumps) and still provide acceptable reliability and linear relationship.

Characterization of fragile bone tissue is challenging and available methodologies include quasi-static compressive tests of small size specimens, ultrasound and indentation techniques. We hypothesized that modal analysis of flexure beams could be a complementary methodology to obtain Young modulus. The sampling methodology was adapted such that the uniqueness of the linear dynamic response was available to determine the elastic modulus from natural frequencies and mode shapes. In a first step, the methodology was validated using a synthetic bone model as control. Then, water-jet cutting allowed collecting fourteen small beam-like specimens in canine distal femurs. X-ray microtomography confirmed the microarchitecture preservation, the homogeneity and the isotropy at the specimen scale to derive effective properties. The first natural frequency in clamped-free boundary conditions was used to obtain mean values of Young modulus, which ranged from 210 MPa to 280 MPa depending on the specimen collection site. Experimental tests were rapid and reproducible and our preliminary results were in good agreement with literature data.

Twenty volunteers participated in a single experimental session during which their postural stability was assessed based upon the center of pressure (COP) trajectories during the transitions in two typical sensory conditions: with eyes open (EO) and with eyes closed (EC). To quantify the postural control we applied Fitts' model treating the postural sway as the noise at the initial and the target setpoint control. Results showed that in young healthy subjects characteristics of the transition to either left or right single-leg stance were quite symmetrical. The postural sway at the target posture was characterized by the double increase of postural sway when tested with EO and by the almost quadrupled amount of sway in EC trials. The sway at the target resulted in the decline of the COP mean and peak velocity proportionally to the movement index of difficulty (ID). The estimated ID value increased by 74% in EC trials while the probability of instability increased to 70%.

Reliable and objective measurements are important to ascertain throughout rehabilitation. Current methods-manual muscle testing, electromechanical dynamometer, and hand-held dynamometer-are accurate and reliable, but have limitations that prevent wide implementation. As healthcare systems adapt to more patient-centered outcome models, changes to the delivery of rehabilitation, whether at-home or in the clinic, must also change to become more cost effective and accessible and provide quantifiable information regarding patient progress. We developed a novel Force Sensing (FoSe) device to quantify either tensile or compressive isometric muscle strength. The device was tested in a laboratory setting with healthy participants (n = 32) and compared to the commonly used hand-held dynamometer (HHD). Participants used both devices to perform several common isometric muscle tests including: hip abduction, knee extension, knee flexion, shoulder external rotation, and shoulder internal rotation. Compared to the HHD, FoSe was found to be an accurate and reliable measurement of force production. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranged from 0.58 to 0.89 without a magnitude dependent variation in force measurement.

Hip joint loading depends, in part, on muscle-induced joint reaction forces (JRFs), and therefore, is influenced by hip muscle moment arm lengths (MALs) and lines of action (LoAs). The current study used subject-specific musculoskeletal models and in-vivo motion analysis to quantify the effects of DDH bony anatomy on dynamic muscle MALs, LoAs, and their contributions to JRF peaks during early (~17%) and late-stance (~52%) of gait. Compared to healthy hips (N = 15, 16-39 y/o), the abductor muscles in patients with untreated DDH (N = 15, 16-39 y/o) had smaller abduction MALs (e.g. anterior gluteus medius, 35.3 vs. 41.6 mm in early stance, 45.4 vs. 52.6 mm late stance, p ≤ 0.01) and more medially-directed LoAs. Abduction-adduction and rotation MALs also differed for major hip flexors such as rectus femoris and iliacus. The altered MALs in DDH corresponded to higher hip abductor forces, medial JRFs (1.26 vs. 0.87 × BW early stance, p = 0.03), and resultant JRFs (5.71 vs. 4.97 × BW late stance, p = 0.05). DDH anatomy not only affected hip muscle force generation in the primary plane of function, but also their out-of-plane mechanics, which collectively elevated JRFs. Overall, hip muscle MALs and their contributions to JRFs were significantly altered by DDH bony anatomy. Therefore, to better understand the mechanisms of joint degeneration and improve the efficacy of treatments for DDH, the dynamic anatomy-force relationships and multi-planar functions of the whole hip musculature must be collectively considered.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A chronic Type A (Stanford) dissected aorta was retrieved for research from a 73-year-old male donor without diagnosed genetic disease. The aorta presented a dissection over the full length, and it reached a diameter of 7.7 cm in its ascending portion. The descending thoracic aorta underwent layer-specific quasi-static and dynamic mechanical characterizations after layer separation. Mechanical tests showed a physiological (healthy) behavior of the intima and some mechanical anomalies of the media and the adventitia. In particular, the static stiffness of both these layers at smaller strains was three times smaller than any one measured for twelve healthy aortas. When the viscoelastic properties were tested, adventitia presented a larger relative increase of the dynamic stiffness at 3 Hz with respect to most of the healthy aortas. The loss factor of the adventitia, which is associated with dissipation, was at the lower limit of those measured for healthy aortas. It seems reasonable to attribute these anomalies of the mechanical properties exhibited by the media and the adventitia to the severe remodeling secondary to the chronic nature of the dissection.

Knowing the required mechanical power output is of relevance due to its relationship with the metabolic power. For example, a better understanding of the dependencies of required mechanical power output on weight, running and wind speed, step frequency, ground contact time etc. is very valuable for the assessment, analysis and optimization of running performance. Therefore, a mathematical model based on very few assumptions is devised. The purpose of the proposed model is to relate running speed and required mechanical power output as an algebraic function of the runner's mass, height, step rate, ground contact time and wind speed. This is relevant in order to better understand the mechanical energy cost of locomotion, and how much it depends on which parameters. The first of the main energy dissipation mechanisms is due to vertical oscillation, i.e., during each step some of the potential energy difference gets transformed into heat. The second mechanism is due to the anterior ground reaction force during the first part of stance and the third is due to aerodynamic drag. With the approximations of constant running speed and a sinusoidal vertical ground reaction force profile one obtains closed algebraic expressions for the center of mass trajectory and the required mechanical power output. Comparisons of model predictions and reported performance data suggest that approximately a quarter of the ground impact energy is stored during the first part of ground contact and then released during the remaining stance phase. Further, one can conclude from the model that less mechanical power output is required when running with higher step rates and a higher center of mass. Non intuitive is the result that a shorter ground contact time is beneficial for fast runs, while the opposite holds for slow runs. An important advantage of the devised model compared to others is that it leads to closed algebraic expressions for the center of mass trajectory and mechanical power output, which are functions of measurable quantities, i.e., of step rate, ground contact time, running speed, runner's mass, center of mass height, aerodynamic drag at some given speed, wind speed and heart rate. Moreover, the model relies on very few assumptions, which have been verified, and the only tuning parameter is the ratio of recovered elastic energy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These fluctuations are typically reported as pulsatile velocity-time traces or fast-Fourier-transformed power-frequency spectra, often from a single point or at most a handful of points. Originally inspired by its use in spectral Doppler ultrasound, here we demonstrate the utility of the simplest form of time-frequency representation - the spectrogram - as a more comprehensive yet still-intuitive means of visualizing the potential harmonic complexity of pulsatile cardiovascular flows. After reviewing the basic theory behind spectrograms, notably the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), we discuss the choice of input parameters that inform the appearance and trade-offs of spectrograms. We show that spectrograms using STFT were able to highlight spectral features and were representative of those obtained from more complex methods such as the Continuous Wavelet transforms (CWT). While visualization properties (colourmap, filtering, smoothing/interpolation) are shown to affect the conspicuity of spectral features, the window properties (function, size, overlap) are shown to have the greatest impact on the resulting spectrogram appearance. Using a set of cerebral aneurysm CFD cases, we show that spectrograms can readily reveal the case-specific nature of the time-varying flow instabilities, whether broadband, suggesting intermittent turbulent-like flow, or narrowband, suggesting laminar vortex shedding, or some combination thereof.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The 3D velocity profiles obtained from 4D flow MRI were given as input boundary conditions to a computational fluid dynamics analysis (CFD) model. After performing the CFD analyses, we verified that the obtained time-averaged velocity profiles and flow eccentricity were in good agreement with 4D flow MRI. Then we used the CFD analyses to evaluate the time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and the local normalized helicity (LNH). We found that the flow eccentricities at the aortic root were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between TAV and BAV phenotypes. TAWSS (R2 = 0.697, p = 0.025) and absolute LNH (R2 = 0.964, p < 0.001) are in good correlation with flow eccentricity. We conclude that eccentricity at the aortic root is a major determinant of hemodynamics patterns in ATAA patients regardless of the aortic valve phenotype.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Current reports in CP are conflicting. The tendon travel method of estimating MA requires constant force, but passive force is high and variable in CP, and range of motion is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine triceps surae muscle MA in 12 subjects with mild to moderate CP (15-32 years) and 10 typically developing peers (TD, 17-26 years) by tendon travel and by visually measuring the apparent MA. MA was calculated at 90° and at a reference angle (∼106°) with zero net passive moment. The tendon travel (28.8 ± 5.6 mm) and visual methods (29.1 ± 5.5 mm) yielded similar MA in CP (p = 0.94) at the reference angle. TD had significantly larger triceps surae muscle MA than CP subjects (p = 0.002), 35.4 ± 4.1 mm at the reference angle for tendon travel and 35.4 ± 3.6 mm by the visual method. Test/retest revealed less bias (0.8 mm) using the visual method. Calculated active peak isometric force was significantly less in CP (1983.8 ± 887.0 N) than TD (4104.9 ± 1154.9 N, p < 0.001). There are challenges in estimating MA in CP, but the visual method is more reliable. Although a shorter moment arm would reduce the joint moment, joint angular velocity for a given velocity of muscle shortening would be enhanced. Strength training may mitigate the effects of the smaller moment arm and reduced joint moment generated in those with CP.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Injuries in knee cartilage are often characterized by lesions or tears. In addition to acute traumatic joint injuries, microscale damages, which may form because of wear, are thought to be a contributing factor in the development of osteoarthritis. While the overall function of a joint may not be affected by the presence of microcracks, we hypothesized that strain magnification in the vicinity of microcracks might be significant. We tested this hypothesis by creating partial cuts in articular cartilages and measuring the strain within 20 µm from the edge of these cuts. Measurements were made in the superficial and middle zones of articular cartilage extract samples. We found that local strain in the vicinity of cuts is magnified by a factor of 1.2-1.6 compared to strains in intact regions for nominal compressions exceeding 5%. For nominal compressions of less than 5%, no strain magnification was detected in the vicinity of the cracks. We concluded that articular cartilage cracks magnify local strains by damaging the structural integrity and decreasing the fluid pressure in the matrix.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, no evidence exists associating greater isometric hip abductor muscle strength with smaller peak hip adduction angle during running. Beyond muscle strength, muscle activation patterns may play an important role in controlling joint movement during running. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine if associations existed among hip adduction angle, hip abductor muscle activity, and isometric hip abductor muscle strength. Twenty-five currently healthy female runners participated. Average gluteus medius muscle activity and tensor fascia lata muscle activity were determined during hip abductor maximal voluntary isometric contractions. Three-dimensional kinematics and hip abductor muscle activity were collected during treadmill running. Dependent variables were analyzed via Pearson product moment correlations. Multi-variable linear regression determined muscle activity's and strength's contributions to the peak hip adduction angle. A fair positive correlation was observed between the peak hip adduction angle and average tensor fascia lata muscle activity magnitude. Additionally, there was a moderate negative correlation between isometric hip abductor muscle strength and average gluteus medius muscle activity magnitude. Tensor fascia lata activity magnitude accounted for the most variance of the peak hip adduction angle. This study adds to the literature which indicates a lack of association between isometric hip abductor muscle strength and peak hip adduction angle in healthy runners. Factors other than hip abductor muscle strength and activation may account for more of the variance in peak hip adduction angles among runners.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Bone tissue-engineered techniques are improving, and adjuncts such as vascularization technologies allow re-evaluation of traditional reconstructive methods for healingofcritical-sized bone defect. Slow infiltration rate of vasculogenesis after cell-seeded scaffold implantation limits the use of clinically relevant large-sized scaffolds. Hence, in vitro vascularization within the tissue-engineered bone before implantation is required to overcome the serious challenge of low cell survival rate after implantation which affects bone tissue regeneration and osseointegration. Mechanobiological interactions between cells and microvascular mechanics regulate biological processes regarding cell behavior. In addition, load-bearing scaffolds demand mechanical stability properties after vascularization to have adequate strength while implanted. With the advent of bioreactors, vascularization has been greatly improved by biomechanical regulation of stem cell differentiation through fluid-induced shear stress and synergizing osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation in multispecies coculture cells. The benefits of vascularization are clear: avoidance of mass transfer limitation and oxygen deprivation, a significant decrease in cell necrosis, and consequently bone development, regeneration and remodeling. Here, we discuss specific techniques to avoid pitfalls and optimize vascularization results of tissue-engineered bone. Cell source, scaffold modifications and bioreactor design, and technique specifics all play a critical role in this new, and rapidly growing method for bone defect reconstruction. Given the crucial importance of long-term survival of vascular network in physiological function of 3D engineered-bone constructs, greater knowledge of vascularization approaches may lead to the development of new strategies towards stabilization of formed vascular structure.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False
