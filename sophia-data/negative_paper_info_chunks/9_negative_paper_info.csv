We found that the enzyme from Petrotoga mobilis (P. mob) necessitates an absolute requirement of the allosteric effector (fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate) to ensure functionality. In contrast, even without allosteric effector, the LDH from Thermus thermophilus (T. the) is functional when the temperature is raised. We report the crystal structure of P. mob LDH in the Apo state solved at 1.9 Å resolution. We used this structure and the one from T. the, obtained previously, as a starting point for MD simulations at various temperatures. We found clear differences between the thermal dynamics, which accounts for the behavior of the two enzymes. Our work demonstrates that, within an allosteric enzyme, some areas act as local gatekeepers of signal transmission, allowing the enzyme to populate either the T-inactive or the R-active states with different degrees of stringency.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although the NiRs have been well studied, with over 100 Protein Data Bank entries, such issues as crystal packing, photoreduction, and lack of high pH cases have impeded structural analysis of their catalytic mechanisms. Here we show the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Achromobacter cycloclastes NiR (AcNiR) at pH 6.2 and 8.1. The optimization of 3D-reconstruction parameters achieved 2.99 and 2.85 Å resolution. Comprehensive comparisons with cryo-EM and 56 AcNiR crystal structures suggested crystallographic artifacts in residues 185-215 and His255' due to packing and photoreduction, respectively. We used a newly developed map comparison method to detect structural change around the type 2 Cu site. While the theoretical estimation of coordinate errors of cryo-EM structures remains difficult, combined analysis using X-ray and cryo-EM structures will allow deeper insight into the local structural changes of proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Indeed, in their free form, most transition metal ions are toxic. Therefore, an excess of physiologic metal ions or the uptake of non-physiologic metal ions can be highly detrimental to the organism. It is thus fundamental to understand metal distribution under physiological, pathological or environmental conditions, for instance in metal-related pathologies or upon environmental exposure to metals. Elemental imaging techniques can serve this purpose, by allowing the visualization and the quantification of metal species in tissues down to the level of cell organelles. Synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) microscopy is one of the most sensitive techniques to date, and great progress was made to reach nanoscale spatial resolution. Here we propose a correlative method to couple SR-XRF to electron microscopy (EM), with the possibility to quantify selected elemental contents in a specific organelle of interest with 50x50 nm2 raster scan resolution. We performed EM and SR-XRF on the same section of hepatocytes exposed to silver nanoparticles, in order to identify mitochondria through EM and visualize Ag co-localized with these organelles through SR-XRF. We demonstrate the accumulation of silver in mitochondria, which can reach a 10-fold higher silver concentration compared to the surrounding cytosol. The sample preparation and experimental setup can be adapted to other scientific questions, making the correlative use of SR-XRF and EM suitable to address a large panel of biological questions related to metal homeostasis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The human gut bacterium Ruminococcus bromii synthesizes two extracellular pullulanases, Amy10 and Amy12, that are incorporated into the multiprotein amylosome complex that enables the digestion of granular resistant starch from the diet. Here we provide a comparative biochemical analysis of these pullulanases and the x-ray crystal structure of the wild type and the nucleophile mutant D392A of Amy12 complexed with maltoheptaose and 63-α-D glucosyl-maltotriose. While Amy10 displays higher catalytic efficiency on pullulan and cleaves only α1,6 linkages, Amy12 has some activity on α1,4 linkages suggesting that these enzymes are not redundant within the amylosome. Our structures of Amy12 include a mucin-binding protein (MucBP) domain that follows the C-domain of the GH13 fold, an atypical feature of these enzymes. The wild type Amy12 structure with maltoheptaose captured two oligosaccharides in the active site arranged as expected following catalysis of an α1,6 branch point in amylopectin. The nucleophile mutant D392A complexed with maltoheptaose or 63-α-D glucosyl-maltotriose captured β-glucose at the reducing end in the -1 subsite, facilitated by the truncation of the active site aspartate and stabilized by stacking with Y279. The core interface between the co-crystallized ligands and Amy12 occurs within the -2 through +1 subsites, which may allow for flexible recognition of α1,6 linkages within a variety of starch structures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

During evolution, slugs have lost their mineralized external shell but some of them have retained an internal shell (IS). Unlike external shells, which have been widely investigated, the ISs have been poorly studied. We report for the first time the compositional and complete morphological characterization of Ariolimax californicus' IS. According to literature, this shell calcifies and decalcifies depending on the animal's needs. Its composition is mostly organic, consisting of proteins and β-chitin. The internal shell is organized in layers and membranes in which CaCO3 crystal formation occurs in specific areas. In the two faces of the IS we observed different morphologies and aggregations of calcite bio-crystals along with a different organization of the organic matrix. Dorsally, the mineral forms a thick layer composed of misaligned crystal aggregates of large dimensions, separated by thin organic layers. This suggest a protective purpose and the use of this layer as a long-term calcium storage system. Ventrally, the mineral phase is organized in small crystal aggregates of comparable size, separated by thin organic layers, and quite aligned one to the other. The whole ventral mineral layer is covered by a membrane, identified as the hypostracum. This face is proposed to be a short-term calcium storage system. In vitro crystallization experiments suggest massive calcium ions sequestration from the solution for the precipitation of calcite crystals inside the organic matrix. In conclusion, this research provides new information on the dynamic of biomineralization on mollusk evolved in calcium-poor environments.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In response, bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements have co-evolved anti-CRISPR proteins to inhibit the bacterial defense. We and others have previously shown that anti-CRISPR associated (Aca) proteins can regulate this anti-CRISPR counter-attack. Here, we report the first structure of an Aca protein, the Aca2 DNA-binding transcriptional autorepressor from Pectobacterium carotovorum bacteriophage ZF40, determined to 1.34 Å. Aca2 presents a conserved N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a previously uncharacterized C-terminal dimerization domain. Dimerization positions the Aca2 recognition helices for insertion into the major grooves of target DNA, supporting its role in regulating anti-CRISPRs. Furthermore, database comparisons identified uncharacterized Aca2 structural homologs in pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that Aca2 represents the first characterized member of a more widespread family of transcriptional regulators.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Alba domain containing proteins have been reported to be involved in many cellular processes, such as regulation of translation, maintaining genome stability, regulation of RNA processing and so on. In Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), there are four Alba proteins identified, which are named TbAlba1 to TbAlba4. However, the structure and function of TbAlba proteins are still unknown. Here, we solved the crystal structure of TbAlba1 to a resolution of 2.46 Å. TbAlba1 adopts a similar Alba-fold, which comprises of four β-strands (β1-β4) and three long α-helices (α1-α3).

As for all non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, the morbilliviral genome is enwrapped by thousands of nucleoprotein (N) protomers. Each bound to six ribonucleotides, N protomers assemble to form a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that serves as scaffold for nucleocapsid formation and as template for viral replication and transcription. While the molecular details on RNP complexes elucidated in human measles virus (MeV) served as paradigm model for these processes in all members of the Morbillivirus genus, no structural information has been obtained from other morbilliviruses, nor has any CeMV structure been solved so far. We report the structure of the CeMV RNP complex, reconstituted in vitro upon binding of recombinant CeMV N to poly-adenine ssRNA hexamers and solved to 4.0 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. In spite of the amino acid sequence similarity and consequently similar folding of the N protomer, the CeMV RNP complex exhibits different helical parameters as compared to previously reported MeV orthologs. The CeMV structure reveals exclusive interactions leading to more extensive protomer-RNA and protomer-protomer interfaces. We identified twelve residues, among those varying between CeMV strains, as putatively important for the stabilization of the RNP complex, which highlights the need to study the potential of CeMV N mutations that modulate nucleocapsid assembly to also affect viral phenotype and host adaptation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The ICL of S.cerevisiae (ScIcl1) is tagged for proteasomal degradation through ubiquitination by a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase (the glucose-induced degradation-deficient (GID) complex), whereas that of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (CaIcl1) escapes this process. However, the reason for the ubiquitin targeting specificity of the GID complex for ScIcl1 and not for CaIcl1 is unclear. To gain some insight into this, in this study, the crystal structures of apo ScIcl1 and CaIcl1 in complex with formate and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of apo CaIcl1 were determined at a resolution of 2.3, 2.7, and 2.6Å, respectively. A comparison of the various structures suggests that the orientation of N-terminal helix α1 in S.cerevisiae is likely key to repositioning of ubiquitination sites and contributes to the distinction found in C.albicans ubiquitin evasion mechanism. This finding gives us a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of ubiquitin-dependent ScIcl1 degradation and could serve as a theoretical basis for the research and development of anti-C.albicans drugs based on the concept of CaIcl1 ubiquitination.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we describe a workflow that combines on-grid immunogold labeling, followed by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) imaging and structural analyses to identify and characterize the structure of photosystem II (PSII) complexes. Using an antibody specific to a core subunit of PSII, the D1 protein (uniquely found in the water splitting complex in all oxygenic photoautotrophs), we identified PSII complexes in biophysically active thylakoid membranes isolated from a model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

Since the deamination of guanine to xanthine results in the production of a mutagenic base, these enzymes have evolved to be very specific in nature. Surprisingly, they accept structurally distinct triazine ammeline, an intermediate in the melamine pathway, as one of the moonlighting substrates. Here, by employing NE0047 (a GD from Nitrosomonas europaea), we delineate the nuance in the catalytic mechanism that allows these two distinct substrates to be catalyzed. A combination of enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallographic, and calorimetric studies reveal that GDs operate via a dual proton shuttle mechanism with two glutamates, E79 and E143, crucial for deamination. Additionally, N66 appears to be central for substrate anchoring and participates in catalysis. The study highlights the importance of closure of the catalytic loop and of maintenance of the hydrophobic core by capping residues like F141 and F48 for the creation of an apt environment for activation of the zinc-assisted catalysis. This study also analyzes evolutionarily distinct GDs and asserts that GDs incorporate subtle variations in the active site architectures while keeping the most critical active site determinants conserved.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

AO-LapA is secreted as a zymogen by the host and requires enzymatic cleavage of the autoinhibitory propeptide to reveal its full activity. Scarcity of structural data of zymogen aminopeptidases hampers a better understanding of the details of their molecular action of autoinhibition and how this might be utilised to improve the properties of such enzymes by recombinant methods for more effective bioprocessing. To address this gap in the literature, herein we report high-resolution crystal structures of recombinantly expressed AO-LapA precursor (AO-proLapA), mature LapA (AO-mLapA) and AO-mLapA complexed with reaction product l-leucine (AO-mLapA-Leu), all purified from Pichia pastoris culture supernatant. Our structures reveal a plausible molecular mechanism of LapA catalytic domain autoinhibition by propeptide and highlights the role of intramolecular chaperone (IMC). Our data suggest an absolute requirement for IMC in the maturation of cognate catalytic domain of AO-LapA. This observation is reinforced by our expression and refolding data of catalytic domain only (AO-refLapA) from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, revealing a limited active conformation. Our work supports the notion that known synthetic aminopeptidase inhibitors and substrates mimic key polar contacts between propeptide and corresponding catalytic domain, demonstrated in our AO-proLapA zymogen crystal structure. Furthermore, understanding the atomic details of the autoinhibitory mechanism of cognate catalytic domains by native propeptides has wider reaching implications toward synthetic production of more effective inhibitors of bimetallic aminopeptidases and other dizinc enzymes that share an analogous reaction mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The kanosamine biosynthetic pathway from glucose 6-phosphate in Bacillus cereus UW85 was recently reported, and the functions of each of the three enzymes in the pathway, KabA, KabB and KabC, were demonstrated. KabA, a member of a subclass of the VIβ family of PLP-dependent aminotransferases, catalyzes the second step in the pathway, generating kanosamine 6-phosphate (K6P) using l-glutamate as the amino-donor. KabA catalysis was shown to be extremely efficient, with a second-order rate constant with respect to K6P transamination of over 107 M-1s-1. Here we report the high-resolution structure of KabA in both the PLP- and PMP-bound forms. In addition, co-crystallization with K6P allowed the structure of KabA in complex with the covalent PLP-K6P adduct to be solved. Co-crystallization or soaking with glutamate or 2-oxoglutarate did not result in crystals with either substrate/product. Reduction of the PLP-KabA complex with sodium cyanoborohydride gave an inactivated enzyme, and crystals of the reduced KabA were soaked with the l-glutamate analog glutarate to mimic the KabA-PLP-l-glutamate complex. Together these four structures give a complete picture of how the active site of KabA recognizes substrates for each half-reaction.

Compared with the first-generation, single-electron counting direct detection camera (Gatan K2), the latest K3 camera is faster, larger, and now offers a correlated-double sampling mode (CDS). Importantly this results in a higher DQE and improved throughput compared to its predecessor. In this study, we focused on optimizing camera data collection parameters for daily use within a cryo-EM facility and explored the balance between throughput and resolution. In total, eight data sets of murine heavy-chain apoferritin were collected at different dose rates and magnifications, using 9-hole image shift data collection strategies. The performance of the camera was characterized by the quality of the resultant 3D reconstructions. Our results demonstrated that the Gatan K3 operating in CDS mode outperformed standard (nonCDS) mode in terms of reconstruction resolution in all tested conditions with 8 electrons per pixel per second being the optimal dose rate. At low magnification (64kx) we were able to achieve reconstruction resolutions of 149% of the physical Nyquist limit (1.8 Å with a 1.346 Å physical pixel). Low magnification allows more particles to be collected per image, aiding analysis of heterogeneous samples requiring large data sets. At moderate magnification (105kx, 0.834 Å physical pixel size) we achieved a resolution of 1.65 Å within 9 hours of data collection, a condition optimal for achieving high-resolution on well behaved samples. Our results also show that for an optimal sample like apoferritin, one can achieve better than 2.5 Å resolution with 5 minutes of data collection.

Most biological specimens are too thick to be directly investigated and are therefore thinned by milling with a focused ion beam under cryogenic conditions (cryo-FIB). This procedure is prone to contaminations, which makes it a tedious process, often leading to suboptimal results. Here, we present new hardware that overcomes the current limitations. We developed a new glove box and a high vacuum cryo transfer system and installed a stage heater, a cryo-shield and a cryo-shutter in the FIB milling microscope. This reduces the ice contamination during the transfer and milling process and simplifies the handling of the sample. In addition, we tested a new software application that automates the key milling steps. Together, these improvements allow for high-quality, high-throughput cryo-FIB milling.

Owing to the limited tilting range of samples with a slab geometry, electron tomograms suffer from so-called missing wedge information in Fourier space. In dual-axis cryo-ET, two tomograms reconstructed from orthogonally oriented tilt series are combined into a tomogram with improved resolution as the missing wedge information is reduced to a pyramid. Volta phase plate (VPP) allows to perform in-focus cryo-ET with high contrast transfer at low-resolution frequencies and thus its application may improve the quality of dual-axis tomograms. Here, we compare dual-axis cryo-ET with and without VPP on Ebola virus-like particles to visualize and segment viral and host cell proteins within the membrane-enveloped filamentous particles. Dual-axis VPP cryo-ET reduces the missing wedge information and ray artifacts arising from the weighted back-projection during tomogram reconstruction, thereby minimizing ambiguity in the analysis of crowded environments and facilitating 3D segmentation. We show that dual-axis VPP tomograms provide a comprehensive description of macromolecular organizations such as nucleocapsid assembly states, the distribution of glycoproteins on the viral envelope and asymmetric arrangements of the VP40 layer in non-filamentous regions of virus-like particles. Our data reveal actin filaments within virus-like particles in close proximity to the viral VP40 scaffold, suggesting a direct interaction between VP40 and actin filaments. Dual-axis VPP cryo-ET provides more complete 3D information at high contrast and allows for better interpretation of macromolecule interactions and pleomorphic organizations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Structurally, Tth-MCO has a unique feature: a β-hairpin near the T1Cu site, which is not present in any other laccases deposited at the PDB. This β-hairpin has an expected crystallographic behavior in solvent-exposed areas of a crystallized protein: lack of electron density, high B-values and several crystalline contacts with neighboring crystallographic copies; however, its dynamical behavior in solution and its biological implications have not been described. Here, we describe four new Tth-MCO crystallographic structures, and the β-hairpin behavior has been analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations, considering the effect of pH and temperature. The β-hairpin new crystallographic conformations described here, together with their dynamics, were used to understand the pH-restrained laccase activity of Tth-MCO against substrates as syringaldazine. Remarkably, there are insertions in laccases from Thermus and Meiothermus genus, sharing the same position and a methionine-rich composition of the Tth-MCO β-hairpin. This unique high methionine content of the Tth-MCO β-hairpin is responsible to coordinate, Ag+1 and Hg+1 in oxidative conditions, but Cu+1 and Cu+2 are not coordinated in crystallographic experiments, regardless of the redox conditions; however, Ag+1 addition does not affect Tth-MCO laccase activity against syringaldazine. Here, we propose that the pH-dependent β-hairpin dynamical behavior could explain, at least in part, the inefficient laccase activity displayed by Tth-MCO in acidic pH values.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is this intermediate that mediates toxicity and it has been suggested, somewhat controversially, that it has the α-sheet structure. Nests and α-strands are similar peptide motifs in that alternate residues lie in the αR and γL regions of the Ramachandran plot for nests, or αR and αL regions for α-strands. In nests a concavity is formed by the main chain NH atoms whereas in α-strands the main chain is almost straight. Using ""Ramachandran propensity plots"" to focus on the α L/γL region, it is shown that glycine favours γL (82% of amino acids are glycine), but disfavours α L (3% are glycine). Most charged and polar amino acids favour α L with asparagine having by far the highest propensity. Thus, glycine favours nests but, contrary to common expectation, should not favour α-sheet. By contrast most charged or polar amino acids should favour α-sheet by their propensity for the α L conformation, which is more discriminating amongst amino acids than the α R conformation. Thus, these results suggest the composition of sequences that favour α-sheet formation and point towards effective prediction of α-sheet from sequence.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

High expression levels of BRP39 have been detected in breast carcinoma. It helps in proliferation of cells during the progression of this disease and may act as a signaling factor. BRP39 may act as a potential candidate for rational structure-based drug design against breast carcinoma. In this study, we report the crystal structure of mouse recombinant BRP39 expressed in E. coli. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.6 Å resolution. The overall structure of BRP39 consisted of two globular domains: a large (β/α)8 triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain and a small (α+β) domain. Three non-proline cis-peptides were detected in the sugar-binding cleft of BRP39, including Ser57-Phe58, Leu141-Tyr142, and Trp353-Ala354. The latter residues were conserved in other GH18 family members. It was notable that the conformation of critical Trp100 residue within the sugar-binding cleft was oriented away from the barrel. The side-chain conformation was found to be similar to that observed in chitinases, however, it was oriented into the barrel in other chitinase-like proteins (CLPs). The conformation of this critical residue may have significant implications in sugar binding. Further, two amino acid substitutions were observed in the sugar-binding groove of BRP39. The conserved Asn100 and Arg263 in Hcgp39 and other CLPs proteins (SPX-40 structures) were substituted by Lys101 and Lys264 in BRP39 which may have a significant impact on the sugar-binding properties.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In reconstruction of amyloid fibril structures from cryo-EM images, an important early step is the selection of fibril locations. This fibril picking step is typically done by hand, a tedious process when thousands of images need to be analyzed. Here we present a computer program called FibrilFinder that identifies the locations and directions of fibril segments in cryo-EM images, by using the properties that the fibrils should be linear objects and have widths within a specified range. The program outputs the fibril locations in text files compatible with the RELION density reconstruction program. After RELION is used to extract the particle image boxes contained in the fibril segments identified by FibrilFinder, a second program called FibrilFixer removes boxes that contain more than one fibril, for instance because two fibrils cross each other. As concrete and realistic examples, we describe the application of the two programs to cryo-EM images of two different amyloid fibrils, namely 40-residue amyloid-β fibrils derived from human brain tissue by seeded growth and fibrils formed by the C-terminal half of the low-complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS. Both examples of amyloid fibrils can be picked from cryo-EM images using the same set of FibrilFinder and FibrilFixer parameters, showing that this software does not require re-optimization for each sample. A set of 1337 cryo-EM images was analyzed in 17 minutes with one multi-core computer. The new fibril picking software should enable the rapid analysis and comparison of more helical structures using cryo-EM, and perhaps serve as part of the greater automation of the entire structure determination process.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, there is a gap of knowledge between the decoded genome and the structure. To bridge the gap, we focused on the secondary structure (SS). From a comprehensive analysis of predicted SS of proteins in different types of organisms, we have arrived at the following findings: The proportions of SS in genomes were different among phylogenic domains. The distributions of strand lengths indicated structural limitations in all of the species. Different from bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes have an abundance of α-helical and random coil proteins. Interestingly, there was a relationship between SS and post-translational modifications. By calculating hydrophobicity moments of helices and strands, highly amphipathic fragments of SS were found, which might be related to the biological functions. In conclusion, comprehensive predictions of SS will provide valuable perspectives to understand the entire protein structures in genomes and will help one to discover or design functional proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In mammals, the regulatory (R) subunits sequester and target the catalytic (C) subunits to proper subcellular locations. This targeting is accomplished by the dimerization and docking (D/D) domain of the R subunits. The activation of the holoenzyme depends on the binding of the second messenger cAMP. The only available structures of the D/D domain proceed from mammalian sources. Unlike dimeric mammalian counterparts, the R subunit from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bcy1) forms tetramers in solution. Here we describe the first high-resolution structure of a non-mammalian D/D domain. The tetramer in the crystals of the Bcy1 D/D domain is a dimer of dimers that retain the classical D/D domain fold. By using phylogenetic and structural analyses combined with site-directed mutagenesis, we found that fungal R subunits present an insertion of a single amino acid at the D/D domain that shifts the position of a downstream, conserved arginine. This residue participates in intra-dimer interactions in mammalian D/D domains, while due to this insertion it is involved in inter-dimer contacts in Bcy1, which are crucial for the stability of the tetramer. This surprising finding challenges well-established concepts regarding the oligomeric state within the PKAR protein family and provides important insights into the yet unexplored structural diversity of the D/D domains and the molecular determinants of R subunit oligomerization.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Hence, preventing dissociation of the dimer would maintain the enzymatic activity in detrimental conditions e.g. high temperature. To prevent dissociation of the dimer, a disulphide (S-S) bond was introduced at the dimer interface. In the wild type structure, S126 interacts with S126 of the other monomer. In the presented work, a mutant was designed with an S126C substitution. The crystal structure of the S126C mutant showed that only 50-70% of monomers formed the S-S bond. This observed imperfect S-S bonding was likely caused by photolytic S-S bond breakage mediated by the neighbouring tryptophan residue. In the wild type, S126 is located facing W163 and forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with E164; W163 and E164 are crucial in the enzyme's activity. The replacement of S126 by a cysteine residue lowered the activity of the enzyme by ∼70%. S126 has never been considered to play a role in the enzyme's activity or stability, thus the finding showed the importance of this residue.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Little is known about how these changes affect the tooth response to load. Using a series of finite element models of teeth attached to the jawbone, and by comparing these to a validated model of a 'young' pig 3-rooted tooth, the effects of these structural changes were studied. Models of altered teeth show a stiffer response to mastication even when material properties used are identical to those found in 'young' teeth. This stiffening response to occlusal loads is mostly caused by the thicker cementum found in 'old' teeth. Tensile stresses associated with bending of dentine in the roots fall into a narrower distribution range with lower peak values. It is speculated that this is a possible protective adaptation mechanism of the aging tooth to avoid fracture. The greatest reduction in lateral motion was seen in the bucco-lingual direction. We propose that greater tooth motion during mastication is typical for the young growing animal. This motion is reduced in adulthood, favoring less off-axis loading, possibly to counteract natural bone resorption and consequent compromised anchoring.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These antiterminators are generally composed of three modules, an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (CAT) followed by two homologous regulation modules (PRD1 and PRD2) that control the RNA binding activity of the effector domain via phosphorylation on conserved histidines. Although several structures of isolated domains of BglG-like proteins have been described, no structure containing CAT and at least one PRD simultaneously has yet been reported in an active state, precluding detailed understanding of signal transduction between modules. To fulfill this gap, we recently reported the complete NMR sequence assignment of a constitutively active mutant (D99N) CAT-PRD1*, which contains the effector domain and the first regulation domain of LicT. As a follow-up, we have determined and report here the 3D solution structure of this active, dimeric LicT construct (40 kDa). The structure reveals how the mutation constrains the PRD1 regulation domain into an active conformation which is transduced to CAT via a network of negatively charged residues belonging to PRD1 dimeric interface and to the linker region. In addition, our data support a model where BglG-type antitermination regulatory modules can only adopt a single conformation compatible with the active structure of the effector domain, regardless of whether activation is mediated by mutation on the first or second PRD. The linker between the effector and regulation modules appears to function as an adaptable hinge tuning the position of the functional modules.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This process usually requires particle picking, clustering and alignment of subtomograms to produce an average structure of the complex. When applied to heterogeneous samples, template-free clustering and alignment of subtomograms can potentially lead to the discovery of structures for unknown endogenous complexes. However, such methods require scoring functions to measure and accurately rank the quality of aligned subtomogram clusters, which can be compromised by contaminations from misclassified complexes and alignment errors. Here, we provide the first study to assess the effectiveness of more than 15 scoring functions for evaluating the quality of subtomogram clusters, which differ in the amount of structural misalignments and contaminations due to misclassified complexes. We assessed both experimental and simulated subtomograms as ground truth data sets. Our analysis showed that the robustness of scoring functions varies largely. Most scores were sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio of subtomograms and often required Gaussian filtering as preprocessing for improved performance. Two scoring functions, Spectral SNR-based Fourier Shell Correlation and Pearson Correlation in the Fourier domain with missing wedge correction, showed a robust ranking of subtomogram clusters without any preprocessing and irrespective of SNR levels of subtomograms. Of these two scoring functions, Spectral SNR-based Fourier Shell Correlation was fastest to compute and is a better choice for handling large numbers of subtomograms.

Neutron contrast matching experiments on selectively deuterated heterodimers allow us to define the contribution of each subunit to the solution scattering. SiRHP binding induces a change in the position of SiRFP's flavodoxin-like domain relative to its ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase domain while compacting SiRHP's N-terminus. Reduction of SiRFP leads to a more open structure relative to its oxidized state, re-positioning SiRFP's N-terminal flavodoxin-like domain towards the SiRHP binding position.

 The high SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number driving the COVID-19 pandemic has been a mystery. Our recent in vitro, and in vivo coronaviral pathogenesis studies involving Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) suggest a crucial role for a small host membrane-virus contact initiator region of the Spike protein, called the fusion peptide that enhances the virus fusogenicity and infectivity. Here we study the Spike from five human β-coronaviruses (HCoV) including the SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 for comparison. The structural and dynamics analyses of the Spike show that its fusion loop spatially organizes three fusion peptides contiguous to each other to synergistically trigger the virus-host membrane fusion process. We propose a Contact Initiation Model based on the architecture of the Spike quaternary structure that explains the obligatory participation of the fusion loop in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. Among all the HCoV Spikes in this study, SARS-CoV-2 has the most hydrophobic surface and the extent of hydrophobicity correlates with the reproductive number and infectivity of the other HCoV. Comparison between results from standard and replica exchange molecular dynamics reveal the unique physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The importance of the fusion loop makes it an apt target for anti-virals and vaccine candidates.

The results from thermal shift assay (TSA, ΔTm, 18.82±0.51°C) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC, Kd, 7.30±2.20 nM) suggested that there is an intense binding force and favorable thermodynamic changes during the process of KW-2478 binding with Hsp90N. Additionally, KW-2478 exhibited favorable anti-NSCLC activity in vitro, as it inhibited cell proliferation (IC50, 8.16 μM for A549; 14.29 μM for H1975) and migration, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis. Thirty-six novel KW-2478 derivatives were designed, based on the complex crystal structure and molecular interaction analysis of Hsp90N-KW-2478 complex. Among them, twenty-two derivatives exhibited increased binding force with Hsp90N evaluated by molecular docking assay. The results would provide new guidance for anti-NSCLC new drug development based on the lead compound KW-2478.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Cryo-CLEM provides advantages for identifying and distinguishing fluorescently labeled proteins, macromolecular complexes, and organelles from the cellular environment. Challenges remain on how correlation workflows and software tools are implemented on different microscope platforms to support automated cryo-EM data acquisition. Here, we present CorRelator: an open-source desktop application that bridges between cryo-FLM and real-time cryo-EM/ET automated data collection. CorRelator implements a pixel-coordinate-to-stage-position transformation for flexible, high accuracy on-the-fly and post-acquisition correlation. CorRelator can be integrated into cryo-CLEM workflows and easily adapted to standard fluorescence and transmission electron microscope (TEM) system configurations. CorRelator was benchmarked under live-cell and cryogenic conditions using several FLM and TEM instruments, demonstrating that CorRelator reliably supports real-time, automated correlative cryo-EM/ET acquisition, through a combination of software-aided and interactive alignment.

Experimental results demonstrate the ability of 3DVA to resolve multiple flexible motions of α-helices in the sub-50 kDa transmembrane domain of a GPCR complex, bending modes of a sodium ion channel, five types of symmetric and symmetry-breaking flexibility in a proteasome, large motions in a spliceosome complex, and discrete conformational states of a ribosome assembly. 3DVA is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite their importance in many Earth science disciplines, there is still little consensus on foraminiferal shell mineralization. Geochemical, biochemical, and physiological studies showed that foraminiferal shell formation might take place through various and diverse mineralization mechanisms. In this study, we contribute to benthic foraminiferal shell calcification through deciphering crystallite organization within the shells. We base our conclusions on results gained from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements and describe microstructure/texture characteristics within the laminated shell walls of the benthic, symbiontic foraminifera: Ammonia tepida, Amphistegina lobifera, Amphistegina lessonii. We highlight crystallite assembly patterns obtained on differently oriented cuts and discuss crystallite sizes, morphologies, interlinkages, orientations, co-orientation strengths. We show that: (i) crystals within benthic foraminiferal shells are mesocrystals, (ii) have dendritic-fractal morphologies and (iii) interdigitate strongly. Based on crystal size, we (iv) differentiate between the two layers that comprise the shells and demonstrate that (v) crystals in the septa have different assemblies relative to those in the shell walls. We highlight that (vi) at junctions of different shell elements the axis of crystal orientation jumps abruptly such that their assembly in EBSD maps has a bimodal distribution. We proof (vii) extensive twin-formation within foraminiferal calcite and demonstrate (viii) the presence of two twin modes: 60°/[001] and 77°/∼[6-61] and visualize their distributions within the shells.

Clinical manifestations of OI include skeletal fragility, bone deformities, and severe functional disabilities, such as hearing loss. Progressive hearing loss, usually beginning in childhood, affects approximately 70% of people with OI with more than half of the cases involving the inner ear. There is no cure for OI nor a treatment to ameliorate its corresponding hearing loss, and very little is known about the properties of OI ears. In this study, we investigate the morphology of the otic capsule and the cochlea in the inner ear of the oim mouse model of OI. High-resolution 3D images of 8-week old oim and WT inner ears were acquired using synchrotron microtomography. Volumetric morphometric measurements were conducted for the otic capsule, its intracortical canal network and osteocyte lacunae, and for the cochlear spiral ducts. Our results show that the morphology of the cochlea is preserved in the oim ears at 8 weeks of age but the otic capsule has a greater cortical thickness and altered intracortical bone porosity, with a larger number and volume density of highly branched canals in the oim otic capsule. These results portray a state of compromised bone quality in the otic capsule of the oim mice that may contribute to their hearing loss.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Unfortunately, comparatively little is known about freshwater zooplankton in lakes influenced by the Southern Ocean. In order to predict the impact of climate change and chemicals on freshwater species like B. poppei, it is necessary to understand the nature of their most resilient life stages. Embryos of B. poppei survive up to two centuries in a resilient dormant state, but no published studies evaluate the encapsulating wall that protects theses embryos or their development after dormancy. This study fills that knowledge gap by using microscopy to examine development and the encapsulating wall in B. poppei embryos from Antarctica. The encapsulating wall of B. poppei is comprised of three layers that appear to be conserved among crustacean zooplankton, but emergence and hatching are uniquely delayed until the nauplius is fully formed in this species. Diapause embryos in Antarctic sediments appear to be in a partially syncytial mid-gastrula stage. The number of nuclei quadruples between the end of diapause and hatching. Approximately 75% of yolk platelets are completely consumed during the same time period. However, some yolk platelets are left completely intact at the time of hatching. Preservation of complete yolk platelets suggests an all-or-none biochemical process for activating yolk consumption that is inactivated during dormancy to preserve yolk for post-dormancy development. The implications of these and additional ultrastructural features are discussed in the context of anthropogenic influence and the natural environment.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The domain lengths within the rod are preserved exactly, both Type I and Type II chains have been recognised, and sequence identity/homology exists between their respective chains. Nonetheless, there are characteristic differences in amino acid composition and sequence between their respective head (N-terminal) domains and their tail (C-terminal) domains, though some similarities are retained. Further, there is evidence of tandem repeats of a variety of lengths in the tuatara heads and tails indicative of sequence duplication events. These are not evident in human α-keratins and would therefore have implications for the physical attributes of the tissues in the two species. Multiple families of keratin-associated proteins that are ultra-high cysteine-rich or glycine+tyrosine-rich in human and other species do not have direct equivalents in the tuatara. Although high-sulphur proteins are present in tuatara the cysteine residue contents are significantly lower than in human. Further, no sequence homologies between the HS proteins in the two species have been found, thereby casting considerable doubt as to whether any matrix-forming high-sulphur proteins exist in tuatara. These observations may be correlated with the numerous cysteine-rich β-keratins (corneous β-proteins) that are present in tuatara, but which are conspicuously absent in mammals.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Its RNA subunit RMRP catalyzes the cleavage of substrate RNAs, and the protein components of RNase MRP are required for activity. RMRP mutations are associated with several types of inherited developmental disorders, but the pathogenic mechanism is largely unknown. Recent structural studies shed lights on the catalytic mechanism of yeast RNase MRP and the closely related RNase P; however, the structural and catalytic mechanism of RMRP in human RNase MRP complex remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the P3 domain of RMRP in complex with the RPP20 and RPP25 proteins of human RNase MRP, which shows that the P3 RNA binds to a conserved positively-charged surface of the RPP20-RPP25 heterodimer through its distal stem and internal loop regions. The disease-related mutations of RMRPP3 are mostly located at the protein-RNA interface and are likely to weaken the binding of P3 to RPP20-RPP25. Moreover, the structure reveals a homodimeric organization of the entire RPP20-RPP25-RMRPP3 complex, which might mediate the dimerization of human RNase MRP complex in cells. These findings provide structural clues to the assembly and pathogenesis of human RNase MRP complex and also reveal a tetrameric feature of RPP20-RPP25 evolutionarily conserved with that of the archaeal Alba proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We have determined a 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of the ligand-free THF riboswitch aptamer. The pseudoknot binding site 'unwinds' in the absence of ligand, whereby the adjacent helical domains (P1, P2, and P3) become disjointed, resulting in rotation and misalignment of the gene-regulatory P1 helix with respect to P3. In contrast, the second binding site at the three-way junction, which is the first to fold, is structurally conserved between apo and holo forms. This suggests a kinetic role for this site, in which binding of the first ligand molecule to the stably folded three-way junction promotes formation of the regulatory pseudoknot site and subsequent binding of the second molecule. As such, these findings provide a molecular basis for both conformational switching and kinetic control.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These protruding systems are primary targets for drug and vaccine development. Upon contact between injectisomes and host membranes, toxin secretion is triggered. How this works structurally and functionally is yet unknown. Using cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography, we visualized injectisomes of Yersinia enterocolitica inside the phagosomes of infected human myeloid cells in a close-to-native state. We observed that a minimum needle length is required for injectisomes to contact the host membrane and bending of host membranes by some injectisomes that contact the host. Through subtomogram averaging, the structure of the entire injectisome was determined, which revealed structural differences in the cytosolic sorting platform compared to other bacteria. These findings contribute to understanding how injectisomes secrete toxins into host cells and provides the indispensable native context.

Prior to tomogram reconstruction, CET tilt-series recorded on FIB lamellae need to be aligned. Traditionally, CET tilt-series alignment is performed with 5-20 nm gold fiducials, but it has thus far proven difficult to apply this to FIB lamellae of eukaryotic cells. In here, we describe a simple method to allow uptake of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-gold fiducials into mammalian cells via endocytosis, which can subsequently be used as fiducials for tilt-series alignment of cryo-FIB lamellae. We compare the alignment of tilt-series with BSA-gold fiducials to fiducial-less patch-tracking, and find better alignment results with BSA-gold.

Once activated, GPCRs sample a large conformational space and couple to G-proteins to initiate distinct signaling pathways. The dynamical behavior of GPCR-G-protein complexes is difficult characterize structurally, and it might hinder obtaining routine high-resolution density maps in single-particle reconstructions.

We compare the outcome of this analysis with recent results obtained on the cannabinoid-Gi- and secretin-Gs-receptor complexes. Despite differences related to the biochemical compositions of the three samples, a set of consensus movements emerges.

These fibrils often assemble into more complex structures, providing mechanical stability, strength, or toughness to the host tissue. Unfortunately, there is little information available on individual fibril dynamics, mechanics, growth, aggregation and remodeling because they are difficult to image using visible light as a probe. The principle quantity of interest is the fibril diameter, which is difficult to extract accurately, dynamically, in situ and non-destructively. An optical method, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy has been used to visualize dynamic structures that are as small as microtubules (25 nm diameter) and has been shown to be sensitive to the size of objects smaller than the wavelength of light. In this investigation, we take advantage of DIC microscopy's ability to report dimensions of nanometer scale objects to generate a curve that relates collagen diameter to DIC edge intensity shift (DIC-EIS). We further calibrate the curve using electron microscopy and demonstrate a linear correlation between fibril diameter and the DIC-EIS. Using a non-oil immersion, 40x objective (NA 0.6), collagen fibril diameters between ~100 nm to ~ 300 nm could be obtained with ±11 and ±4 nm accuracy for dehydrated and hydrated fibrils, respectively.

Aspergillus fumigatus is the most important pathogen responsible for invasive aspergillosis and possesses two major β-CAs, CafA and CafB. Recently we reported the biochemical characterization and 1.8 Å crystal structure of CafA. Here, we report a crystallographic analysis of CafB revealing the mechanism of enzyme catalysis and establish the relationship of this enzyme to other β-CAs. While CafA has a typical open conformation, CafB, when exposed to acidic pH and/or an oxidative environment, has a novel type of active site in which a disulfide bond is formed between two zinc-ligating cysteines, expelling the zinc ion and stabilizing the inactive form of the enzyme. Based on the structural data, we generated an oxidation-resistant mutant (Y159A) of CafB. The crystal structure of the mutant under reducing conditions retains a catalytic zinc at the expected position, tetrahedrally coordinated by three residues (C57, H113 and C116) and an aspartic acid (D59), and replacing the zinc-bound water molecule in the closed form. Furthermore, the active site of CafB crystals grown under zinc-limiting conditions has a novel conformation in which the solvent-exposed catalytic cysteine (C116) is flipped out of the metal coordination sphere, facilitating release of the zinc ion. Taken together, our results suggest that A. fumigatus use sophisticated activity-inhibiting strategies to enhance its survival during infection.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, namely immunocytokines, represent a promising solution for the regulation of the immune system at the site of disease. The three-dimensional arrangement of these molecules can profoundly influence their biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. Structural techniques might provide important insight in the 3D arrangement of immunocytokines. Here, we performed structure investigations on clinical grade fusion proteins L19-IL2, IL12-L19L19 and L19L19-IL2 to elucidate their quaternary organization. Crystallographic characterization of the common L19 antibody fragment at a resolution of 2.0-Å was combined with low-resolution studies of the full-length chimeric molecules using small-angle synchrotron X-ray scattering (SAXS) and negative stain electron microscopy. Characterization of the full-length quaternary structures of the immunocytokines in solution by SAXS consistently supported the diabody structure in the L19-IL2 immunocytokine and allowed generation of low-resolution models of the chimeric proteins L19L19-IL2 and IL12-L19L19. Comparison with 3D reconstructions obtained from negative-stain electron microscopy revealed marked flexibility associated to the linker regions connecting the cytokine and the antibody components of the chimeric proteins.

We aimed to analyze the structural relationship among the needle-like crystals of the iron oxide goethite, the amorphous silica phase that forms the tooth base and occupy inter-crystalline spaces in the cusp, and the chitin fibers of the matrix. Goethite crystals followed the three dimensional organization pattern of the chitin fibers in the cusp. In the tooth base, spherical individual silica granules were found in regions where the chitin fibers cross. The spherical granules near the interface between the tooth base and the cusp (junction zone) formed an almost continuous medium that could easily be ultrathin-sectioned for further analysis. By contrast, the nearby silica-rich region localized on the other side of the junction zone contained needle-like goethite crystals immersed in the matrix and presented a conchoidal fracture. The chitin fibers from the silica granules of the tooth base were dotted or undulating in projection with a periodicity of about 6 nm when observed by high magnification transmission electron microscopy. Very thin goethite crystals were present in the base of the cusp near the junction zone surrounded by silica. On several occasions, crystals presented internal thin straight white lines parallel to the major axis, indicating a possible growth around fibers.

BH4 functions as co-factor in neurotransmitter biosynthesis. BH4 homeostasis is a promising target to treat pain disorders in patients. The function of mammalian GCH1s is regulated by a metabolic sensing mechanism involving a regulator protein, GCH1 feedback regulatory protein (GFRP). Dependent on the relative cellular concentrations of effector ligands, BH4 and phenylalanine, GFRP binds GCH1 to form inhibited or activated complexes, respectively. We determined high-resolution structures of the ligand-free and -bound human GFRP and GCH1-GFRP complexes by X-ray crystallography. Highly similar binding modes of the substrate analogue 7-deaza-GTP to active and inhibited GCH1-GFRP complexes confirm a novel, dissociation rate-controlled mechanism of non-competitive inhibition to be at work. Further, analysis of all structures shows that upon binding of the effector molecules, the conformations of GCH1 or GFRP are altered and form highly complementary surfaces triggering a picomolar interaction of GFRP and GCH1 with extremely slow koff values, while GCH1-GFRP complexes rapidly disintegrate in absence of BH4 or phenylalanine. Finally, comparing behavior of full-length and N-terminally truncated GCH1 we conclude that the disordered GCH1 N-terminus does not have impact on complex formation and enzymatic activity. In summary, this comprehensive and methodologically diverse study helps to provide a better understanding of the regulation of GCH1 by GFRP and could thus stimulate research on GCH1 modulating drugs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous studies (Toxicon 2005, 46:768-74) found that the peptide is toxic in crabs, although the structural and functional properties of acrorhagin I have not been reported. In this work, an Escherichia coli (BL21 strain) expression system was established for the preparation of 13C,15N-labelled acrorhagin I, and the solution structure was determined using NMR spectroscopy. Structurally, acrorhagin I is similar to B-IV toxin from the marine worm Cerebratulus lacteus (PDB id 1VIB), with a well-defined helical hairpin structure stabilised by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. The recombinant peptide was tested in patch-clamp electrophysiology assays against voltage-gated potassium and sodium channels, and in bacterial and fungal growth inhibitory assays and haemolytic assays. Acrorhagin I was not active against any of the ion channels tested and showed no activity in functional assays, indicating that this peptide may possess a different biological function. Metal ion interaction studies using NMR spectroscopy showed that acrorhagin I bound zinc and nickel, suggesting that its function might be modulated by metal ions or that it may be involved in regulating metal ion levels and their transport.

After the emergence of the pandemic the major focus of efforts to attenuate the infection has been on repurposing the already approved drugs to treat COVID-19 adopting a fast-track strategy. However, to date a specific regimen to treat COVID-19 is not available. Over the last few months a substantial amount of data about the structures of various key proteins and their recognition partners involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis has emerged. These studies have not only provided the molecular level descriptions ofthe viral pathogenesis but also laid the foundation for rational drug design and discovery. In this review, we have recapitulated the structural details of four key viral enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3-chymotrypsin like protease, papain-like protease and helicase, and two host factors including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease involved in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and described the potential hotspots present on these structures which could be explored for therapeutic intervention. We have also discussed the significance of endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidases as potential targets for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

These two proteins are major constituents of neutrophils. In response to a pathological condition, they can be released extracellularly and become alarmins that induce both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals, through specific cell surface receptors. They also act as antimicrobial agents, mainly as a S100A8/A9 heterocomplex, through metal sequestration. The mechanisms whereby divalent cations modulate the extracellular functions of S100A8 and S100A9 are still unclear. Importantly, it has been proposed that these ions may affect both the ternary and quaternary structure of these proteins, thereby influencing their physiological properties. In the present study, we report the crystal structures of WT and C80A murine S100A9 (mS100A9), determined at 1.45 and 2.35 Å resolution, respectively, in the presence of calcium and zinc. These structures reveal a canonical homodimeric form for the protein. They also unravel an intramolecular disulfide bridge that stabilizes the C-terminal tail in a rigid conformation, thus shaping a second Zn-binding site per S100A9 protomer. In solution, mS100A9 apparently binds only two zinc ions per homodimer, with an affinity in the micromolar range, and aggregates in the presence of excess zinc. Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that mS100A9 can form both non-covalent and covalent homodimers with distinct disulfide bond patterns. Interestingly, calcium and zinc seem to affect differentially the relative proportion of these forms. We discuss how the metal-dependent interconversion between mS100A9 homodimers may explain the versatility of physiological functions attributed to the protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their integrated oscillatory activity continuously propels an overlying pollution-protecting mucus layer in cranial direction, leading to mucociliary clearance - the primary defence mechanism of the airways. Mucociliary transport is commonly thought to co-emerge with the collective ciliary motion pattern under appropriate geometrical and rheological conditions. Proper ciliary alignment is therefore considered essential to establish mucociliary clearance in the respiratory system. Here, we used volume electron microscopy in combination with high-speed reflection contrast microscopy in order to examine ciliary orientation and its spatial organization, as well as to measure the propagation direction of metachronal waves and the direction of mucociliary transport on bovine tracheal epithelia with reference to the tracheal long axis (TLA). Ciliary orientation is measured in terms of the basal body orientation (BBO) and the axonemal orientation (AO), which are commonly considered to coincide, both equivalently indicating the effective stroke as well as the mucociliary transport direction. Our results, however, reveal that only the AO is in line with the mucociliary transport, which was found to run along a left-handed helical trajectory, whereas the BBO was found to be aligned with the TLA. Furthermore, we show that even if ciliary orientation remains consistent between adjacent cells, ciliary orientation exhibits a gradual shift within individual cells. Together with the symplectic beating geometry, this intracellular orientational pattern could provide for the propulsion of highly viscous mucus and likely constitutes a compromise between efficiency and robustness.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The molecular genetic basis of CdLS is linked to defects in cohesin, a protein complex that functions in sister chromatid cohesion, chromatin organization, and transcriptional regulation. Histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) plays an important role in cohesin function by catalyzing the deacetylation of SMC3, which is required for efficient recycling of the cohesin complex. Missense mutations in HDAC8 have been identified in children diagnosed with CdLS spectrum disorders, and here we outline structure-function relationships for four of these mutations. Specifically, we report the 1.50 Å-resolution structure of the I45T HDAC8-suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid complex, the 1.84 Å-resolution structure of E66D/Y306F HDAC8 complexed with a peptide assay substrate, and the 2.40 Å-resolution structure of G320R HDAC8 complexed with the inhibitor M344. Additionally, we present a computationally generated model of D176G HDAC8. These structures illuminate new structure-function relationships for HDAC8 and highlight the importance of long-range interactions in the protein scaffold that can influence catalytic function.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Supported by X-ray microdiffraction data, and applying a model based on an ideal composite material consisting of rods (KIFs) and matrix (KAPs), to Monilethrix affected fibres it has been shown that the results could be grouped into clearly different classes, namely: almost isotropic behaviour for Monilethrix affected hairs and anisotropic behaviour for Control hair. Moreover, AFM nanoindentation of hair cross sections has demonstrated, also for the first time that hairs affected by Monilethrix have a continuous, and not periodic, weakness within the cortex. This has been attributed to disruptions in the KIF-KIF, KIF-intermacrofibrillar matrix or KIF-desmosome complexes within the hair shaft, as suggested by X-ray microdiffraction examination. Hairs from a patient exhibiting no obvious phenotype exhibited similar mechanical weakness despite the otherwise normal visual appearance of the fibre. This further supports a hypothesis that the beaded appearance of Monilethrix hair is a secondary factor, unrelated to the inherent structural weakness.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

An adenine pairing with another adenine is one of the eight possible mismatches. The atomistic insights about the structure and dynamics of an A…A mismatch in a DNA (unbound form) is not yet accessible to any experimental technique. Earlier molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that A…A mismatch in the midst of 5'CAG/3'GAC, 5'GAC/3'CAG and 5'CAA/3'GAT (underline represents the mismatch) are highly dynamic in nature. By employing MD simulation, the influence of an A...A mismatch in the midst of 5'GAA/3'CAT, 5'GAG/3'CAC, 5'AAC/3'TAG, 5'AAG/3'TAC, 5'TAA/3'AAT, 5'TAT/3'AAA and 5'AAT/3'TAA sequences have been investigated here. The results indicate that irrespective of the flanking sequences, the mismatch samples a variety of transient conformations, including a B-Z junction. Further, circular dichroism studies have been carried out to explore the ability of these sequences to bind with hZαADAR1 which specifically recognizes B-Z junction/Z-DNA. The results indicate that hZαADAR1 could not lead to a complete B to Z transition in the above sequences. Notably, a complete transition to Z-form has been reported earlier for 5'GAC/3'CAG upon titrating with hZαADAR1. Intriguingly, 5'AAC/3'TAG, 5'AAG/3'TAC and 5'GAA/3'CAT exhibit a B-Z junction formation rather than a complete transition to Z-form, similar to the situation of 5'CAA/3'GAT. These indicate that although A…A mismatch could induce a local B-Z junction transiently, hZαADAR1 requires the presence of a G…C/C…G base pair adjacent to the A…A mismatch for the binding. Additionally, the extent of B-Z junction has enhanced upon binding with hZαADAR1 in the presence of the A…A mismatch (specifically when CG, CA, AC, GA and AG steps occur), but not in the presence of the canonical base pairs. These confirm the inclination of A…A mismatch towards the B-Z junction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In the study of mechanisms underlying its development attention has been paid to the microtubular network of its cells, mainly on βIII tubulin, considered as a marker of malignancy. In the present work, we chose to investigate the tubulin code in glioblastoma cells, analyzing the degree of interaction between tubulin post-translational modifications and different proteins associated with them. The pattern of diverse associated proteins such as EB-1, CLIP-170 and kinesin-1 and their degree of co-distribution with the most abundant post-translational tubulin modifications (tyrosination, acetylation and polyglutamylation) were evaluated. Through immunofluorescence we have shown that EB-1, CLIP-170 and kinesin-1 were well detectable in glioblastoma cells. The double fluorescence and colocalization index between the post-translational modifications of tubulin and associated proteins showed that tyrosinated α-tubulin has significantly high affinity with EB-1, CLIP-170 and kinesin-1, while for acetylated and polyglutamylated tubulin, the degree of interaction with the three associated proteins evaluated was less apparent. Data presented in this paper underline the importance of a thorough analysis of the microtubular mechanics in glioblastoma cells.

A wealth of structural information on SCP2 domains in all forms of life is currently available; however, many aspects of its ligand binding activity are poorly understood. ylSCP2 is a well-characterized single domain SCP2 from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Herein, we report the X-ray structure of unliganded ylSCP2 refined to 2.0 Å resolution. Comparison with the previously solved liganded ylSCP2 structure unveiled a novel mechanism for binding site occlusion. The liganded ylSCP2 binding site is a large cavity with a volume of more than 800 Å3. In unliganded ylSCP2 the binding site is reduced to about 140 Å3. The obliteration is caused by a swing movement of the C-terminal α helix 5 and a subtle compaction of helices 2-4. Previous pairwise comparisons were between homologous SCP2 domains with a uncertain binding status. The reported unliganded ylSCP2 structure allows for the first time a fully controlled comparative analysis of the conformational effects of ligand occupation dispelling several doubts regarding the architecture of SCP2 binding site.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Taurine is an abundant amino acid with multiple physiological functions, including osmoregulation, pH regulation, antioxidative protection, and neuromodulation. In mammalian tissues, taurine is mainly produced by decarboxylation of cysteine sulphinic acid to hypotaurine, catalysed by the PLP-dependent cysteine sulphinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD), followed by non-enzymatic oxidation of the product to taurine. We determined the crystal structure of mouse CSAD and compared it to other PLP-dependent decarboxylases in order to identify determinants of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. Recognition of the substrate involves distinct side chains forming the substrate-binding cavity. In addition, the backbone conformation of a buried active-site loop appears to be a critical determinant for substrate side chain binding in PLP-dependent decarboxylases. Phe94 was predicted to affect substrate specificity, and its mutation to serine altered both the catalytic properties of CSAD and its stability. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we further showed that CSAD presents open/close motions in solution. The structure of apo-CSAD indicates that the active site gets more ordered upon internal aldimine formation. Taken together, the results highlight details of substrate recognition in PLP-dependent decarboxylases and provide starting points for structure-based inhibitor design with the aim of affecting the biosynthesis of taurine and other abundant amino acid metabolites.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Plants practice significant silicon and calcium based biomineralization in which silicon is deposited as silica in cell walls and intracellularly in various cell-types, while calcium is deposited mostly as calcium oxalate in vacuoles of specialized cells. In this review, we compare cellular processes leading to protein-dependent mineralization in plants, diatoms and sponges (phylum Porifera). The mechanisms of biomineralization in these organisms are inherently different. The composite silica structure in diatoms forms inside the cytoplasm in a membrane bound vesicle, which after maturation is exocytosed to the cell surface. In sponges, separate vesicles with the mineral precursor (silicic acid), an inorganic template, and organic molecules, fuse together and are extruded out. In plants, calcium oxalate precursors are concentrated in a vacuolar vesicle containing a protein matrix which is never exocytosed. Silica deposition in grass silica cells takes place outside the cell membrane when the cells secrete the mineralizing protein into the apoplasm rich with silicic acid (the mineral precursor molecules). Our review infers that the organism complexity and precursor reactivity (calcium and oxalate versus silicic acid) are main driving forces for the evolution of varied mineralization mechanisms.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The way these two types of cells interact to set up this tissue is not fully understood and results in the formation of subunits in the enameloid: the Single Crystallite Enameloid (SCE) and the Bundled Crystallite Enameloid (BCE). Using the Focused Ion Beam Nanotomography (FIB-nt), 3D images were produced to assess the relationship between the SCE and BCE of one fossil and one recent neoselachian shark teeth. 3D analysis of crystallite bundles reveals a strong connection between the crystallites forming the SCE and those forming the bundles of the Radial Bundle Enameloid (RBE), a component of the BCE, although it has been suggested that SCE and BCE have a different origin: epithelial for the SCE and mesenchymal for the BCE. Another significant result of the use of FIB-nt is the visualization of frequent branching among the radial bundles forming the RBE, including horizontal link between adjacent bundles. FIB-nt demonstrates therefore a strong potential to decipher the complex evolution of hyper-mineralised tissue in shark teeth, and, therefore, to better understand the evolution of tooth structure among basal Gnathostomes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

On the basis of Tris-bound AtPCO2, we modelled the Cys-bound AtPCO2 structure and identified key residues involved in N-Cys oxidation. Alanine substitution of potential N-Cys interaction residues impaired the activity of AtPCO5 remarkably.

Key to this capability is the periodontal ligament (PDL), a connective tissue containing a collagenous fibre network which connects the tooth roots to the alveolar bone socket and which allows the teeth to move when loaded. It has been suggested that rodent molars under load experience a screw-like downward motion but it remains unclear whether this movement also occurs in primates. Here we use synchroton micro-computed tomography paired with an axial loading setup to investigate the form-function relationship between tooth movement and the morphology of the PDL space in a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). The loading behavior of both mandibular and maxillary molars showed a three-dimensional movement with translational and rotational components, which pushes the tooth into the alveolar socket. Moreover, we found a non-uniform PDL thickness distribution and a gradual increase in volumetric proportion of the periodontal vasculature from cervical to apical.

LigA uses NAD+ as the co-factor while the latter uses ATP. Further, the LigA carries out enzymatic activity with a single divalent metal ion in the active site while ATP-dependent ligases use two metal ions. Instead of the second metal ion, LigA have a unique NMN binding subdomain that facilitates the orientation of the β-phosphate and NMN leaving group. LigA are therefore attractive targets for new anti-bacterial therapeutic development. Others and our group have earlier identified several LigA inhibitors that mainly bind to AMP binding site of LigA. However, no inhibitor is known to bind to the unique NMN binding subdomain. We initiated a fragment inhibitor discovery campaign against the M. tuberculosis LigA based on our co-crystal structure of adenylation domain with AMP and NMN. The study identified two fragments, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3H imidazo[4,5-c] pyridine and N-(4-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide, that bind to the NMN site. The fragments inhibit LigA with IC50 of 16.9 and 28.7 µM respectively and exhibit MIC of ∼20 and 60 µg/ml against a temperature sensitive E. coli GR501 ligAts strain, rescued by MtbLigA. Co-crystal structures of the fragments with the adenylation domain of LigA show that they mimic the interactions of NMN.

They are crucial in the fine-tuning of signals by cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) family. They are negative feedback regulators and principally target the activated type I receptors as well as the activated Smad complexes, but with distinct specificities. Smad7 inhibits Smad signaling from all seven type I receptors of the TGF-β family, whereas Smad6 preferentially inhibits Smad signaling from the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptors, BMPR1A and BMPR1B. The target specificities are attributed to the C-terminal MH2 domain. Notably, Smad7 utilizes two alternative molecular surfaces for its inhibitory function against type I receptors. One is a basic groove composed of the first α-helix and the L3 loop, a structure that is shared with Smad6 and receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). The other is a three-finger-like structure (consisting of residues 331-361, 379-387, and the L3 loop) that is unique to Smad7. The underlying structural basis remains to be elucidated in detail. Here, we report the crystal structure of the MH2 domain of mouse Smad7 at 1.9 Å resolution. The three-finger-like structure is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds between residues 331-361 and 379-387, thus forming a molecular surface unique to Smad7.

During signal transduction, OmpR (OmpR-FL) undergoes phosphorylation at its conserved Asp residue in the N-terminal receiver domain (OmpRn) and recognizes the promoter DNA from its C-terminal DNA-binding domain (OmpRc) to elicit an adaptive response. Apart from that, OmpR regulates many genes in Escherichia coli and is important for virulence in several pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation and the structural basis of OmpR-DNA binding is still not fully clear. In this study, we presented the crystal structure of OmpRc in complex with the F1 region of the ompF promoter DNA from E. coli. Our structural analysis suggested that OmpRc binds to its cognate DNA as a homodimer, only in a head-to-tail orientation. Also, the OmpRc apo-form showed a unique domain-swapped crystal structure under different crystallization conditions. Biophysical experimental data, such as NMR, fluorescent polarization and thermal stability, showed that inactive OmpR-FL (unphosphorylated) could bind to promoter DNA with a weaker binding affinity as compared with active OmpR-FL (phosphorylated) or OmpRc, and also confirmed that phosphorylation may only enhance DNA binding.

Here, we investigate the whole uncut and unstained human post-mortem PGs by x-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT). XPCT is an advanced 3D imaging technique, that permits to study of both soft and calcified tissue of a sample at different scales: from the whole organ to cell structure.

We discriminated calcifications with different structure, pinealocytes nuclei and the glial cells processes. All results were validated by histology.

This makes the synthesis of formate from CO2 by NAD+ dependent formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) an attractive process for this purpose. The efficiency of this reaction is however low and to achieve a viable industrial process an optimised engineered enzyme needs to be developed. In order to understand the detailed enzymatic mechanism of catalysis structures of different cofactor and substrate complexes of the FDH from the thermophilic filamentous fungus, Chaetomium thermophilum have been determined to 1.2-1.3 Å resolution. The substrate formate is shown to be held by four hydrogen bonds in the FDH catalytic site within the ternary complex with substrate and NAD+and a secondary formate binding site is observed in crystals soaked with substrate.

They consist of aragonite and comprise four different microstructures and textures from outer to inner shell surfaces: crossed-lamellar, myostracal, complex crossed-lamellar and fibrous prismatic. We characterize with SEM, EBSD, laser-confocal microscopy and AFM imaging mineral unit size, morphology and orientation of crystallites in the different microstructural arrangements and at the transition from one microstructure to the other. We also characterize the microstructure and texture of adductor and pedal retractor myostraca and address structural characteristics at the transition from crossed-lamellar to myostracal assemblies. We find that the crossed-lamellar layer has a three-dimensional crystallographic orientational order. Each set of first-order lamellae consists of twinned aragonite; the two sets of first-order lamellae are misoriented to each other by about 30 to 40° while retaining an approximately parallel a-axis; they do not show any particular twin relationship. Myostracal aragonite grows homoepitactically onto the crossed-lamellar aragonite, but is clearly a separate microstructure, with its own crystallite size and morphology. Within adductor and pedal myostraca, prisms increase in size towards inner surfaces. In contrast to the other shell layers, the myostraca form through competitive growth. The complex crossed-lamellar aragonite initially inherits the three-dimensional texture of the crossed-lamellar microstructure, but with growth develops an axial texture, which is transmitted to the underlying fibrous prismatic microstructure.

Mutations in APP and the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, presenilin, cause familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD). Mutations are assumed to change the substrate-binding and cleavage and thereby the Aβ formed. Whereas a wild-type structure of substrate-bound γ-secretase became recently available from cryogenic electron microscopy (6IYC), the structure and dynamics of mutant proteins remain obscure. Here, we studied five prominent mutants of substrate-bound γ-secretase by explicit all-atom molecular dynamics in a phospholipid membrane model at physiological temperature using the experimental structure as template: The presenilin 1 mutants E280A, G384A, A434C, and L435F and the V717I mutant of APP. Our structures and dynamics provide the first atomic detail into how fAD-causing mutations affect substrate binding to γ-secretase. The pathogenic mutations tend to increase the space and variability in the substrate binding site, as seen e.g. from the distance from catalytic aspartate to substrate cleavage sites.

We hypothesized that when categorized by external bone size, the male femoral diaphysis would show different strength-age trajectories which can be explained by changes in morphology, composition and collagen cross-linking. Cadaveric male femora were sorted into narrow (n = 15, 26-89 years) and wide (n = 15, 29-82 years) groups based upon total cross-sectional area of the mid-shaft normalized to bone length (Tt.Ar/Le) and tested for whole bone strength, tissue-level strength, and tissue-level post-yield strain. Morphology, cortical TMD (Ct.TMD), porosity, direct measurements of enzymatic collagen cross-links, and pentosidine were obtained. The wide group alone showed significant negative correlations with age for tissue-level strength (R2 = 0.50, p = 0.002), tissue-level post-yield strain (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.001) and borderline significance for whole bone strength (R2 = 0.14, p = 0.108). Ct.TMD correlated with whole bone and tissue-level strength for both groups, but pentosidine normalized to enzymatic cross-links correlated negatively with all mechanical properties for the wide group only. The multivariate analysis showed that just three traits for each mechanical property explained the majority of the variance for whole bone strength (Ct.Area, Ct.TMD, Log(PEN/Mature; R2 = 0.75), tissue-level strength (Age, Ct.TMD, Log(DHLNL/HLNL); R2 = 0.56), and post-yield strain (Age, Log(Pyrrole), Ct.Area; R2 = 0.51).

Some basic properties and definitions of quaternion are first recalled. Thereafter, distance and geodesic between rotations are introduced to aid comparisons and interpolations between rotations, which are prerequisites of statistics of rotations in 3D cryoEM. Furthermore, statistics of rotations are reviewed. Techniques potentially useful in cryoEM, such as calculations of the average rotation, generation of quasi-regular grids, sampling, inference with uniform distribution and angular central Gaussian (ACG) distribution, and estimation of rotation precision, are reviewed and developed.

Recently, we showed that genetic reduction of arterial elastin content reduces the severity of medial calcification in matrix Gla protein (MGP)-deficient and Eln haploinsufficient Mgp-/-;Eln+/- mice. This study suggests that there might be a direct effect of elastin amount on medial calcification. We studied this in vitro, using novel in vitro systems, which are based on elastin or elastin-like polypeptides. We first examined the mineral deposition properties of a transfected pigmented epithelial cell line that expresses elastin and other elastic lamina proteins. When grown in inorganic phosphate-supplemented medium, these cells deposited calcium phosphate minerals, which could be prevented by an N'-terminal peptide of MGP (m3pS) carrying phosphorylated serine residues. We next confirmed these findings using a cell-free elastin-like polypeptide (ELP3) scaffold, where the peptide prevented mineral maturation. Overall, this work describes a novel cell culture model for elastocalcinosis and examines the inhibition of mineral deposition by the m3pS peptide in this and a cell-free elastin-based scaffold.

This coenzyme plays a pivotal role in catalysis of various enzymatic reactions that are critical for the survival of organisms. Entamoeba histolytica depends on the uptake of pyridoxal (PL), a B6 vitamer from the external environment which is then phosphorylated by pyridoxal kinase (EhPLK) to form PLP via the salvage pathway. E. histolytica cannot synthesise vitamin B6de-novo, and also lacks pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, a salvage pathway enzyme required to produce PLP from pyridoxine phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP).

These structures provided a snapshot of the transition state and help in understanding the reaction mechanism in greater detail. The EhPLK structure significantly differed from the human homologue at its PLP binding site, and the phylogenetic study also revealed its divergence from human PLK. Further, gene regulation of EhPLK using sense and antisense RNA showed that any change in optimal level is harmful to the pathogen.

Bone tissue, therefore, may be defined by the interplay of its intricately mineralized matrix and the cells that regulate its biological function. However, the far majority of engineered bone model systems and bone replacement materials have been unable to replicate this key characteristic of bone tissue; that is, the ability of cells to be gradually and rapidly embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) heavily calcified matrix material. Here we review the characteristics that define the bone matrix from a nanostructural perspective. We then revisit the benefits and challenges of existing model systems and engineered bone replacement materials, and discuss recent efforts to replicate the biological, cellular, mechanical, and materials characteristics of bone tissue on the nano- to microscale. We pay particular attention to a recently proposed method developed by our group, which seeks to replicate key aspects of the entrapment of bone cells within a mineralized matrix with precisions down to the level of individual nano-crystallites, inclusive of the bone vasculature, and osteogenic differentiation process.

To enable efficient analyses of the hydrogen-bond networks of GPCRs, we implemented here a set of graph-based algorithms, and applied these algorithms to static GPCR structures from structural biology, and from molecular dynamics simulations of two opioid receptors. We find that all static structures included in analyses have a core hydrogen-bond network which, when protein and water dynamics are included with simulations, extends to comprise most of the interior of an inactive receptor. In an active receptor, the dynamic protein-water hydrogen-bond network spans the entire receptor, bridging all functional motifs.

To understand causes of this phenotypic variation, we backcrossed the FGFR2+/C342Y mouse model of Crouzon syndrome onto congenic C57BL/6 and BALB/c backgrounds. Coronal suture fusion was observed in C57BL/6 (88% incidence, p<.001 between genotypes) but not in BALB/c FGFR2+/C342Y mutant mice at 3 weeks after birth, establishing that that the two models differ in phenotype severity. To begin identifying pre-existing modifiers of craniosynostosis severity, we compared transcriptome signatures of cranial tissues from C57BL/6 vs. BALB/c FGFR2+/+ mice. We separately analyzed frontal bone with coronal suture tissue from parietal bone with sagittal suture tissues because the coronal suture but not the sagittal suture fuses in FGFR2+/C342Y mice. The craniosynostosis associated Twist and En1 transcription factors were down-regulated, while Runx2 was up-regulated, in C57BL/6 compared to BALB/c tissues, which could predispose to craniosynostosis. Transcriptome analyses under the GO term MAPK cascade revealed that genes associated with calcium ion channels, angiogenesis, protein quality control and cell stress response were central to transcriptome differences associated with genetic background. FGFR2 and HSPA2 protein levels plus ERK1/2 activity were higher in cells isolated from C57BL/6 than BALB/c cranial tissues. Notably, the HSPA2 protein chaperone is central to craniofacial genetic epistasis, and we find that FGFR2 protein is abnormally processed in primary cells from FGFR2+/C342Y but not FGFR2+/+ mice.

We have previously generated a Bgn/Fmod double knock-out (DKO) mouse model and found it has a 3-fold increase in osteoclastogenesis compared with Wild type (WT) controls, resulting in a markedly low bone mass (LBM) phenotype. To try and rescue/repair the LBM phenotype of Bgn/Fmod DKO mice by suppressing osteoclast formation and activity, 3- and 26-week-old Bgn/Fmod DKO mice and age/gender matched WT controls were treated with OPG-Fc for 6 weeks after which bone parameters were evaluated using DEXA, micro-computedtomographic (μCT) and serum biomarkers analyses. In the appendicular skeleton, OPG-Fc treatment improved some morphometric and geometric parameters in both the trabecular and cortical compartments in Bgn/Fmod DKO female and male mice, especially in the repair module. For many of the skeletal parameters analyzed, the Bgn/Fmod DKO mice were more responsive to the treatment than their WT controls. In addition, we found that OPG-Fc treatment was not able to prevent or ameliorate the formation of ectopic ossification, which are common lesions seen in aged joints and are one of the phenotypical hallmarks of our Bgn/Fmod DKO model. Analysis of skull bones, specifically the occipital bone, showed the treatment recovered some parameters of LBM phenotype in the craniofacial skeleton, more so in the younger rescue module. Using OPG-Fc as treatment alleviated, yet did not completely restore, the severe osteopenia and mineralized tissue structural abnormalities that Bgn/Fmod DKO mice suffer from.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Similarly, visualizing cellular components which locally affect the tissue structure requires a precision of a few tens of nanometers at maximum while spanning several tens of micrometers. In the last decade, gallium focused ion beam (FIB) equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) proved to be an extremely valuable structural tool to meet those ends. In this study, we assess the capability of a recent plasma FIB-SEM technology which provides up to 50x increase in measurement speed over gallium FIB-SEM, thus paving the way to larger volume analysis. Nanometer-scale layers of demineralized and mineralized unstained human femoral lamellar bone were sequentially sectioned over volumes of 6 - 16,000 μm3. Analysis of mineralized tissue revealed prolate ellipsoidal mineral clusters measuring approximately 1.1 µm in length by 700 nm at their maximum diameter. Those features, suggested by others in high resolution studies, appear here as a ubiquitous motif in mineralized lamellar bone over thousands of microns cubed, suggesting a heterogeneous and yet regular pattern of mineral deposition past the single collagen fibril level. This large scale view retained sufficient resolution to visualize the collagen fibrils while also partly visualizing the lacuno-canalicular network in three-dimensions. These findings are strong evidence for suitability of PFIB as a bone analysis tool and the need to revisit bone mineralization over multi-length scales with mineralized tissue.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Similar to all bone tissue type, healing bone contains a lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) housing osteocytes that are known to orchestrate bone remodeling in healthy bone by sensing mechanical strains and translating them into biochemical signals. The structure of the LCN is also hypothesized to influence mineralization processes. Hence, the aim of the present study was to visualize and correlate spatial variations in the LCN topology with mineral characteristics, within and at the interfaces of the different tissue types that comprise healing bone. We applied a correlative multi-method approach to visualize the LCN architecture and quantify mineral particle size and orientation within healing femoral bone in a mouse osteotomy model (26 weeks old C57BL/6 mice). This approach revealed structural differences across several length scales during endochondral ossification within the following regions: calcified cartilage, bony callus, cortical bone and the transition zone between the cortical region and callus that developed during 21 days after the osteotomy. In this transition zone, we observed a continuous convergence of mineral characteristics and osteocyte lacunae shape as well as discontinuities in the lacunae volume and LCN connectivity. The bony callus exhibits a 34% higher lacunae number density with 40% larger lacunar volume compared to cortical bone. The presented correlations between LCN architecture and mineral characteristics improves our understanding of how bone develops during healing and may indicate a contribution of osteocytes to bone (re)modeling.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

 Corona virus spike protein S is a large homo-trimeric protein anchored in the membrane of the virion particle. Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, and contribute symmetrically to a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and to a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.

The Ser/Thr kinase Fused (Fu) promotes Hedgehog signaling by phosphorylating the Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Glioma-associated oncogene homologue (Gli) family of transcription factors. Sufu associates with both Fu and Ci/Gli, but the recognition mechanism between Sufu and Fu remains obscure. Here, our structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Drosophila Sufu (dSufu) in complex with the Sufu-binding site (SBS) of Fu reveals that both main-chain β sheet formation and side-chain hydrophobic interactions contribute to the recognition between Sufu and Fu, and point mutations of highly conserved interface residues eliminated their association. Structural comparison suggests that Fu and Ci/Gli bind on opposite sides of dSufu-NTD, allowing the formation of a Fu-dSufu-Ci ternary complex which facilitates the phosphorylation of Ci/Gli by Fu. Hence, our results provide insights into the Sufu-Fu recognition mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Among many structural changes, a thin layer of highly mineralized and brittle tissue covers part of the external surface of the thin femoral neck cortex in older people and has been proposed to increase hip fragility. However, there have been very limited reports on this hypermineralized tissue in the femoral neck, especially on its ultrastructure. Such information is critical to understanding both the mineralization process and its contributions to hip fracture. Here, we use multiple advanced techniques to characterize the ultrastructure of the hypermineralized tissue in the neck across various length scales. Synchrotron radiation micro-CT found larger but less densely distributed cellular lacunae in hypermineralized tissue than in lamellar bone. When examined under FIB-SEM, the hypermineralized tissue was mainly composed of mineral globules with sizes varying from submicron to a few microns. Nano-sized channels were present within the mineral globules and oriented with the surrounding organic matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed the apatite inside globules were poorly crystalline, while those at the boundaries between the globules had well-defined lattice structure with crystallinity similar to the apatite mineral in lamellar bone. No preferred mineral orientation was observed both inside each globule and at the boundaries. Collectively, we conclude based on these new observations that the hypermineralized tissue is non-lamellar and has less organized mineral, which may contribute to the high brittleness of the tissue.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In contrast to traditional research in the field that has been devoted to the structural and physicochemical aspects of biomineralization, the present study explores transcriptomic aspects of biomineralization as a first step towards adding a complementary molecular layer to this field. The rigidity of the exoskeleton in pancrustaceans dictates essential molt cycles enabling morphological changes and growth. Thus, formation and mineralization of the exoskeleton are concomitant to the timeline of the molt cycle. Skeletal proteinaceous toolkit elements have been discovered in previous studies using innovative molt-related binary gene expression patterns derived from transcriptomic libraries representing the major stages comprising the molt cycle of the decapod crustacean Cherax quadricarinatus. Here, we revisited some prominent exoskeleton-related structural proteins encoding and, using the above molt-related binary pattern methodology, enlarged the transcriptomic database of C.quadricarinatus. The latter was done by establishing a new transcriptomic library of the cuticle forming epithelium and molar tooth at four different molt stages (i.e., inter-molt, early pre-molt, late pre-molt and post-molt) and incorporating it to a previous transcriptome derived from the gastroliths and mandible. The wider multigenic approach facilitated by the newly expanded transcriptomic database not only revisited single genes of the molecular toolkit, but also provided both scattered and specific information that broaden the overview of proteins and gene clusters which are involved in the construction and biomineralization of the exoskeleton in decapod crustaceans.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

They contributed to the evolution of organism complexity, specializing for functions that require quick adaptability such as immunity-related functions. To investigate the hypothesis of repeat protein evolution through exon duplication and rearrangement, we designed a tool to analyze the relationships between exon/intron patterns and structural symmetries. The tool allows comparison of the structure fragments as defined by exon/intron boundaries from Ensembl against the structural element repetitions from RepeatsDB. The all-against-all pairwise structural alignment between fragments and comparison of the two definitions (structural units and exons) are visualized in a single matrix, the ""repeat/exon plot"". An analysis of different repeat protein families, including the solenoids Leucine-Rich, Ankyrin, Pumilio, HEAT repeats and the β propellers Kelch-like, WD40 and RCC1, shows different behaviors, illustrated here through examples. For each example, the analysis of the exon mapping in homologous proteins supports the conservation of their exon patterns. We propose that when a clear-cut relationship between exon and structural boundaries can be identified, it is possible to infer a specific ""evolutionary pattern"" which may improve TRPs detection and classification.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This rigid cuticle is frequently shed during a process called moulting. To reduce calcium loss, most terrestrial isopod species eat the shed cuticle, the exuviae, and absorb the calcium from it through large tubular diverticula of the intestine, called the mid gut glands or hepatopancreas. After moulting the absorbed calcium should be transported immediately into the hemolymph from which it is used to rapidly mineralize the new cuticle. This suggests that the hepatopancreas epithelium transports calcium from the lumen to the hemolymph. We used TEM, energy-filtered TEM and electron-probe X-ray microanalysis to analyse the distribution of elevated calcium within the hepatopancreas cells of P. scaber. We used animals in the postmoult stage that have eaten their exuviae and, as a control, those that have not ingested the exuviae. To minimize calcium loss within the samples, we used high pressure frozen and freeze substituted samples and propane-1-3-diol as floatation medium for thin-sectioning. The results reveal intracellular dense deposits containing calcium, phosphorus and oxygen at the apical microvillus membrane, within the cytoplasm, attached to vesicles and to the basolateral membrane, as well as extracellular between cells and the basal lamina. Control animals were devoid of these deposits. The results indicate that calcium from the exuviae is absorbed and transported across the epithelium into the hemolymph. We propose that during transport, intracellular calcium is bound to phosphate avoiding toxic effects of high concentrations of ionized calcium.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

VbrK/VbrR, a TCS in Vibrio parahaemolyticus, confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics through activating a β-lactamase gene. Its periplasmic sensor domain was previously suggested to detect β-lactam antibiotics by direct binding. Here, we report a crystal structure of the periplasmic sensing domain of VbrK (VbrKSD) using sulfur-based single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (S-SAD) phasing. Contrary to most bacterial sensor domains which form dimers, we show that VbrKSD is a monomer using size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering. This observation is also supported by molecular dynamics simulations. To quantify the binding affinity of β-lactam antibiotics to VbrKSD, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry and other biophysical analyses. Unexpectedly, VbrKSD did not show any significant binding to β-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, we propose that the detection of β-lactam antibiotics by VbrK is likely to be indirect via an as yet unidentified mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The most intimate interaction between the parasite and the host intestine occurs through the anterior region of the nematode body, inserted into the intestinal mucosa during infection. One of the most prominent structures of the nematode surface found at the infection site is the bacillary band, a surface domain formed by a number of cells, mostly stichocytes and bacillary glands, whose structure and function are still under debate. Here, we used confocal microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, helium ion microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and FIB-SEM tomography to unveil the functional role of the bacillary gland cell. We analyzed the surface organization as well as the intracellular milieu of the bacillary glands of Trichuris muris in high pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples. Results showed that the secretory content is preserved in all gland openings, presenting a projected pattern. FIB-SEM analysis showed that the lamellar zone within the bacillary gland chamber is formed by a set of lacunar structures that may exhibit secretory or absorptive functions. In addition, incubation of parasites with the fluid phase endocytosis marker sulforhodamine B showed a time-dependent uptake by the parasite mouth, followed by perfusion through different tissues with ultimate secretion through the bacillary gland. Taken together, the results show that the bacillary gland possess structural characteristics of secretory and absorptive cells and unequivocally demonstrate that the bacillary gland cell functions as a secretory structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

MF-2: Further insight into the biomineralization process.,"Microorganisms are generally involved in the nucleation, growth and phase transformation of carbonate minerals, and influence the development of their morphology and polymorphism. However, understanding of the process of microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) remains limited. Herein, MICP experiments were carried out using Curvibacter sp. HJ-1 and Arthrobacter sp. MF-2 in M2 medium, and the processes of MICP were monitored. Bacterial cells induced the precipitation of carbonate by creating favorable physicochemical conditions and acting as nucleation templates for carbonate particles and thereby, markedly influenced the morphology and growth of the carbonate structure. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secreted by the bacteria was readily absorbed by the precipitated carbonate, which modified its crystal growth orientation. The MgCO3 content of Mg-calcite, induced by MF-2, was dramatically higher than that induced by HJ-1; HJ-1 promoted the formation and stability of aragonite. Multiple formation mechanisms coexisted during the evolution process of the mineral morphologies in the presence of the bacteria.

Growing evidence has uncovered the involvement of one class of extracellular vesicles, named matrix vesicles (MVs), in the formation and delivery of the first mineral nuclei to direct collagen mineralization. MVs are released by mineralization-competent cells equipped with a specific biochemical machinery to initiate mineral formation. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which MVs can trigger this process. Here, we present a combination of in situ investigations and ex vivo analysis of MVs extracted from growing-femurs of chicken embryos to investigate the role played by phosphatidylserine (PS) in the formation of mineral nuclei. By using self-assembled Langmuir monolayers, we reconstructed the nucleation core - a PS-enriched motif thought to trigger mineral formation in the lumen of MVs. In situ infrared spectroscopy of Langmuir monolayers and ex situ analysis by transmission electron microscopy evidenced that mineralization was achieved in supersaturated solutions only when PS was present. PS nucleated amorphous calcium phosphate that converted into biomimetic apatite. By using monolayers containing lipids extracted from native MVs, mineral formation was also evidenced in a manner that resembles the artificial PS-enriched monolayers. PS-enrichment in lipid monolayers creates nanodomains for local increase of supersaturation, leading to the nucleation of ACP at the interface through a multistep process. We posited that PS-mediated nucleation could be a predominant mechanism to produce the very first mineral nuclei during MV-driven bone/cartilage biomineralization.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Using X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT), and focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in serial-surface-view mode, together with 3D reconstruction, entire mouse skeletons and small bone tissue volumes were examined in normal wildtype (WT) and mutant Hyp mice (an animal model for X-linked hypophosphatemia/XLH, a disease with severe hypomineralization of bone). 3D thickness maps of the skeletons showed pronounced irregular thickening and abnormalities of many skeletal elements in Hyp mice compared to WT mice. At the micro- and nanoscale, near the mineralization front in WT tibial bone volumes, mineralization foci grow as expanding prolate ellipsoids to abut and pack against one another to form a congruent and contiguous mineral tessellation pattern within collagen bundles that contributes to lamellar periodicity. In the osteomalacic Hyp mouse bone, mineralization foci form and begin initial ellipsoid growth within normally organized collagen assembly, but their growth trajectory aborts. Mineralization-inhibiting events in XLH/Hyp (low circulating serum phosphate, and increased matrix osteopontin) combine to result in decreased mineral ellipsoid tessellation - a defective mineral-packing organization that leaves discrete mineral volumes isolated in the extracellular matrix such that ellipsoid packing/tessellation is not achieved. Such a severely altered mineralization pattern invariably leads to abnormal compliance, other aberrant biomechanical properties, and altered remodeling of bone, all of which indubitably lead to macroscopic bone deformities and anomalous mechanical performance in XLH/Hyp. Also, we show the relationship of osteocytes and their cell processes to this mineralization pattern.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this work, by using targeted molecular dynamics and rigid body simulation, we demonstrate that if a protein consists of an amyloidogenic region and a globular domain(s) and if the linker between them is short enough, such molecules cannot assemble into amyloid fibrils, instead, they form oligomers with a defined and limited number of β-strands in the cross-β core. We show that this blockage of the amyloid growth is due to the steric repulsion of globular structures linked to amyloidogenic regions. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the linker length and the number of monomers in such nanoparticles. We hypothesise that such oligomerisation can be a yet unrecognised way to form natural protein complexes involved in biological processes.

Further modeling and protein-protein docking work provide a plausible model to explain the interaction between BCP1 and Rpl23.

Earlier modelling had shown that only six classes of structure involving the four 34-residue repeats were possible. In three of these the 34-residue repeats were confined to a single filament (Classes 1, 2 and 3) whereas in the remaining three classes the repeats lay in two, three or four filaments, with some of the linkers forming interfilament connections (Classes 4, 5 and 6). In this work the members of each class of structure (a total of 20 arrangements) have been described and a comparison has been made of the topologies of each of the linker regions. This provides new constraints on the structure of the chain as a whole. Also, analysis of the sequences of the three linker regions has revealed that the central linker (and only the central linker) contains four short regions displaying a distinctive dipeptide repeat of the form (S-X)2,3 separated by short regions containing proline and cysteine residues. By analogy with silk fibroin proteins this has the capability of forming a β-sheet-like conformation.

DEPTOR consists of two DEP domains and a PDZ domain connected by an unstructured linker, and its stability is tightly regulated through post-translational modifications of its linker region that contains the 286SSGYFS291 degron. Based on the mTORC1 complex, our modelling suggests a possible spatial arrangement of DEPTOR which is characterised to form a dimer. Our model shows that DEPTOR's two PDZ domains bind separately to the dimeric mTOR's FAT domains ∼13 Å apart, while the extended linkers are sufficiently long to span from the FAT domain to the kinase domain and beyond to join a shared dimer of the DEP domains. This places S299 closest to the kinase's catalytic site, indicating that phosphorylation would start with it and successively upstream towards the degron. The CK1α kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of DEPTOR's degron, and our docking analysis further reveals that CK1α contains sites to bind DEPTOR's pS286, pS287 and pT295, which may act as priming phosphates for the phosphorylation of S291 of DEPTOR's degron. DEPTOR's linker can also be ubiquitylated by the UbcH5A-SCFβ-TrCP complex without its PDZ dissociating from mTOR according to the modelling. As the catalytic cleft of mTOR's kinase is restricted, interactions between the kinase's unstructured segment surrounding the cleft and DEPTOR's linker, which may involve S293 and S299, may be critical in controlling DEPTOR's access to the catalytic cleft and hence its phosphorylation by mTOR in a manner dependent on mTOR's activation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Biological samples prepared by cryofixation using high-pressure freezing demonstrate optimal preservation of the morphology of cellular structures, as these are arrested instantly in their near-native states. However, samples from cryofixation often show a weak back-scatter electron signal and bad image contrast in FIB-SEM imaging. In addition, it is impossible to do large amounts of heavy metal staining. This is commonly achieved via established osmium impregnation (OTO) en bloc staining protocols. Here, we compared the FIB-SEM image quality of brain tissues prepared using several common freeze-substitution media, and we developed an approach that overcomes these limitations through a combination of osmium tetroxide, uranyl acetate, tannic acid, and potassium permanganate at proper concentrations, respectively. Using this optimized sample preparation protocol for high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, perfect smooth membrane morphology, even of the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane, was readily obtained using FIB-SEM.

Segmentation of 3D renderings of biomineralized structures has long been a bottleneck because of human limitations such as our available time, attention span, eye-hand coordination, cognitive biases, and attainable precision, amongst other limitations. Since recently, some of these routine limitations appear to be surmountable thanks to the development of deep-learning algorithms for biological imagery in general, and for 3D image segmentation in particular. Many components of deep learning often appear too abstract for a life scientist. Despite this, the basic principles underlying deep learning have many easy-to-grasp commonalities with human learning and universal logic. This primer presents these basic principles in what we feel is an intuitive manner, without relying on prerequisite knowledge of informatics and computer science, and with the aim of improving the reader's general literacy in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here, biomineralization case studies are presented to illustrate the application of deep learning for solving segmentation and analysis problems of 3D images ridden by various artifacts, and/or which are plainly difficult to interpret. The presented portfolio of case studies includes three examples of imaging using micro-computed tomography (µCT), and three examples using focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), all on mineralized tissues. We believe this primer will expand the circle of users of deep learning amongst biomineralization researchers and other life scientists involved with 3D imaging, and will encourage incorporation of this powerful tool into their professional skillsets and to explore it further.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Gene vb_24B_21 is the most highly conserved gene across sequenced Shiga bacteriophages. Protein vb_24B_21 (also termed 933Wp42 and NanS-p) is a carbohydrate esterase with homology to the E. coli chromosomally encoded NanS that deacetylates sialic acid in the intestinal mucus. To assist the functional characterization of vb_24B_21, we have studied its molecular structure by homology modelling its esterase domain and by elucidating the crystal structure of its uncharacterized C-terminal domain at the atomic resolution of 0.97 Å. Our modelling confirms that NanS from the E. coli host is the closest structurally characterized homolog to the esterase domain of vb_24B_21. Like NanS, vb_24B_21 has an atypical active site, comprising a simple catalytic dyad Ser-His and a divergent oxyanion hole. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain reveals a lectin-like, jelly-roll β-sandwich fold. The domain displays a prominent cleft that bioinformatics analysis predicts to be a carbohydrate binding site without catalytic properties. In summary, our study indicates that vb_24B_21 is a NanS-like atypical esterase that is assisted by a carbohydrate-binding module of yet undetermined binding specificity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), caused by PHEX mutations, leads to increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)-driven hypophosphatemia and local extracellular matrix disturbances. Hypophosphatasia (HPP), caused by ALPL mutations, results in increased levels of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a mineralization inhibitor. Generalized arterial calcification in infancy (GACI), caused by ENPP1 mutations, results in vascular calcification due to decreased PPi, later compounded by FGF23-driven hypophosphatemia. In this perspective, we compare and contrast dental defects in primary teeth associated with XLH, HPP, and GACI, briefly reviewing genetic and biochemical features of these disorders and findings of clinical and preclinical studies to date, including some of our own recent observations. The distinct dental defects associated with the three heritable mineralization disorders reflect unique processes of the respective dental hard tissues, revealing insights into their development and clues about pathological mechanisms underlying such disorders.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Many shell matrix proteins were annotated from the shells of C. gigas; however, it is unclear which SMPs play important roles in their shell mineralization. The matrix proteins have never been reported from the chalky layer. In this study, we identified a chalky layer-derived EGF-like domain-containing protein (CgELC) from the chalky layer of C. gigas shells. The gene sequence of the CgELC was encoded under CGI_ 10017544 of the C. gigas genome database. Only peptide fragments in the N-terminal region of CGI_ 10017544 were detected by LC-MS/MS analyses, suggesting that CGI_ 10017544 was digested at the predicted protease digestion dibasic site by post-translational modification to become a mature CgELC protein. We produced three types of CgELC recombinant proteins, namely, the full length CgELC, as well as the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of CgELC (CgELC-N or -C, respectively), for in vitro crystallization experiments. In the presence of these recombinant proteins, the aggregation of polycrystalline calcite was observed. Some fibrous organic components seemed to be incorporated into the calcite crystals in the presence of the r-CgELC protein. We also noted different features in the crystallization between CgELC-N and CgELC-C; some crystals were inhibited crystal plane formation and contained many columnar prisms inside the crystals (CgELC-N) and formed numerous holes on their surfaces (CgELC-C).

Although SBEM captures the β -cell structure at a snapshot in time, the observed ultrastructure can be considered representative of a dynamic equilibrium state of the cells since the pancreatic islets are maintained in culture in approximate homeostasis. It was found that 7.2±1.2% (±st. dev.) of the β -cell volume is composed of secretory granule dense-cores exhibiting angular shapes surrounded by wide (typically ≳100 nm) electron-lucent halos. These organelles are identified as mature granules that store insulin for regulated release through the plasma membrane, with a release time of 96±12 hours, as previously obtained from pulsed 35S-radiolabeling of cysteine and methionine. Analysis of β -cell 3D volumes reveals a subpopulation of secretory organelles without electron-lucent halos, identified as immature secretory granules. Another subpopulation of secretory granules is found with thin (typically ≲30 nm) electron-lucent halos, which are attributed to immature granules that are transforming from proinsulin to insulin by action of prohormone convertases. From the volume ratio of proinsulin in the immature granules to insulin in the mature granules, we estimate that the newly formed immature granules remain in morphologically-defined immature states for an average time of 135±14 minutes, and the immature transforming granules for an average time of 130±17 minutes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While much is now known about the mineralization-regulating role of pyrophosphate, less is known about the function of citrate. In order to assess the effect of negatively charged citrate on collagen mineralization, citrate-functionalized, bone osteoid-mimicking dense collagen gels were exposed to simulated body fluid for up to 7 days to examine the multiscale evolution of intra- and interfibrillar collagen mineralization. Here, we show by increases in methylene blue staining that the net negative charge of collagen can be substantially augmented through citrate functionalization. Structural and compositional analyses by transmission and scanning electron (including X-ray microanalysis and electron diffraction) and atomic force microscopy, all demonstrated that citrate-functionalized collagen fibrils underwent extensive intrafibrillar mineralization within 12 hours in simulated body fluid. Time-resolved, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the temporal evolution of intrafibrillar mineralization of single collagen fibrils. Longer exposure to simulated body fluid resulted in additional interfibrillar mineralization, all through an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation towards apatite (assessed by X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). Calcium deposition assays indicated a citrate concentration-dependent temporal increase in mineralization, and micro-computed tomography confirmed that >80 vol% of the collagen in the gels was mineralized by day 7.

Amuc_1100 is an outer-membrane protein of A. muciniphila. Oral administration of Amuc_1100 can reduce fat mass development, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia in mice and activated the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to regulate the immune response of the host, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of the extramembranous domain of Amuc_1100, which consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four α-helices. Two C-terminal helices and the four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed two ""αββ"" motifs and constituted the core domain, which shared a similar fold with type IV pili and type II Secretion system protein. Although the full-length of the extramembranous domain of Amuc_1100 existed as a monomer in solution, they formed trimer in the crystal. Elimination of the N-terminal coiled-coil helix α1 led to dimerization of Amuc_1100 both in solution and in crystal, indicating that the oligomeric state of Amuc_1100 was variable and could be influenced by α1. In addition, we identified that Amuc_1100 could directly bind human TLR2 (hTRL2) in vitro, suggesting that Amuc_1100 may serve as a new ligand for hTLR2.

In this context, we present here the crystal structure of C24, a putative receptor-binding tip-like protein from Bizionia argentinensis JUB59, a psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from the marine surface waters of Potter Cove, Antarctica. The structure resembles the receptor-binding tip from the bacteriophage T4 long tail fiber yet showing marked differences in its domain organization, size, sequence identity and metal binding nature. We confirmed the viral origin of C24 by induction experiments using mitomycin C. Our results reveal the presence of a novel uncharacterized prophage in the genome of B. argentinensis JUB59, whose morphology is compatible with the order Caudovirales and that carries the nucleotide sequence of C24 in its genome.

Faithful ordering of the subunits is mediated by extreme C- and N-terminal regions called docking domains (DDs). Decrypting how specificity is achieved by these elements is important both for understanding PKS function and modifying it to generate useful polyketide analogues for biological evaluation. Here we report the biophysical and structural characterisation of all six PKS/PKS interfaces in the unusual, chimaeric cis-AT/trans-AT PKS pathway responsible for biosynthesis of the antibiotic enacyloxin IIa in Burkholderia ambifaria. Taken together with previous work, our data reveal that specificity is achieved in the enacyloxin PKS by deploying at least three functionally orthogonal classes of DDs. We also demonstrate for the first time that cis-AT PKS subunits incorporate DDs with intrinsically disordered character, reinforcing the utility of such regions for achieving both medium affinity and high specificity at PKS intersubunit junctions. Overall, this work substantially increases the number of orthogonal DDs available for creating novel, highly-specific interfaces within cis- and trans-AT PKSs and their hybrids. It also reveals unexpected sequence/structure relationships in PKS DDs, identifying major current limitations to both accurately predicting and categorising these useful protein-protein interaction motifs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Rab4a-intrinsic GTPase properties that control its activity, i.e. nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis rates, have not yet been thoroughly studied. The determination of these properties is of the utmost importance to understand its functions and contributions to tumorigenesis. Here, we used the constitutively active (Rab4aQ67L) and dominant negative (Rab4aS22N) mutants to characterize the thermodynamical and structural determinants of the interaction between Rab4a and GTP (GTPγS) as well as GDP.

Using a real-time NMR approach and the two aforementioned mutants as controls, we evaluated Rab4a intrinsic nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis rates. Compared to most small GTPases such as Ras, a rapid GTP exchange rate along with slow hydrolysis rate were observed. This suggests that, in a cellular context, Rab4a can self-activate and persist in an activated state in absence of regulatory mechanisms.

 Abstract
 
 COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities with SARS-CoV. Both viruses rely on a protease called the main protease, or Mpro, for replication. Therefore, inhibiting Mpro may be a successful strategy for treating COVID-19. Structures are available in the Protein Data Bank of the main proteases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30-33, 70, 95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when bound to inhibitor N3. Betweenness and stress centrality differences as well as differences in bond energies and relative B-factors when comparing free Mpro to inhibitor-bound Mpro identified residues 131, 175, 182, and 185 as possibly conformationally relevant when bound to the inhibitor N3. Taken together, these results provide insight into conformational changes of betacoronavirus Mpros when bound to an inhibitor.

The comparative structural analysis of the complexes of Mja uL10NTF•23SrRNA(74) and Mja uL10NTF•uL11•23SrRNA(74) shows that the insertion of uL11 in the binary complex does not change the conformation of the 23S rRNA fragment. On the other hand, the interaction with this specific RNA fragment leads to the restructuring of uL11 compared to the structure of this protein in the free state. Besides, although analysis confirmed the mobility of uL10/P0 domain II, disproved the assumption that it may be in contact with rRNA or uL11. In addition, the Mja uL10NTF•uL11•23SrRNA(74) complex was cocrystallized with the antibiotic thiostrepton, and the structure of this complex was solved. The thiostrepton binding site in this archaeal complex was found between the 23S rRNA and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Mja uL11 protein, similar to its binding site in the one of bacterial ribosome complex with thiostrepton. Upon binding of thiostrepton, the NTD of uL11 shifts toward rRNA by 7 Å. Such a shift may be the cause of the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic on the recruitment of translation factors to the GTPase-activating region in archaeal ribosomes, similar to its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis in bacterial ribosomes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Among bacterial Gram-positives, some genera and species mediate attachment to host cells by using long non-flagellar appendages called sortase-dependent pili. A case in point is the beneficial Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG gut-adapted strain that produces the so-called SpaCBA pilus, a structure noted for its promiscuous binding to intestinal mucus and collagen. Structurally, SpaCBA pili are heteropolymers of three different pilin-protein subunits, each with its own location and function in the pilus: backbone SpaA for length, basal SpaB for anchoring, and tip SpaC for adhesion. Previously, we solved the SpaA tertiary structure by X-ray crystallography and also reported on the crystallization of SpaB and SpaC. Here, we reveal the full-length high-resolution (1.9 Å) crystal structure of SpaC, a first for a sortase-dependent pilus-bearing commensal. The SpaC structure, unlike the representative four-domain architecture of other Gram-positive tip pilins, espouses an atypically longer five-domain arrangement that includes N-terminal 'binding' and C-terminal 'stalk' regions of two and three domains, respectively. With the prospect of establishing new mechanistic insights, we provide a structural basis for the multi-substrate binding nature of SpaC, as well as a structural model that reconciles its exclusive localization at the SpaCBA pilus tip.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Crystallographic data show that the N-terminal domain of Escherichia coli McrB binds substrates via a base flipping mechanism. This region is poorly conserved among the plethora of McrB homologs, suggesting that other species may use alternative binding strategies and/or recognize different targets. Here we present the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain from Stayphlothermus marinus McrB (Sm3-180) at 1.92 Å, which adopts a PUA-like EVE fold that is closely related to the YTH and ASCH RNA binding domains. Unlike most PUA-like domains, Sm3-180 binds DNA and can associate with different modified substrates. We find the canonical 'aromatic cage' binding pocket that confers specificity for methylated bases in other EVE/YTH domains is degenerate and occluded in Sm3-180, which may contribute to its promiscuity in target recognition. Further structural comparison between different PUA-like domains identifies motifs and conformational variations that correlate with the preference for binding either DNA or RNA. Together these data have important implications for PUA-like domain specificity and suggest a broader biological versatility for the McrBC family than previously described.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In particular, the anterior tergites are exposed to high mechanical loads and temperatures when individuals guard the entrance of their burrow. We have, therefore, investigated the architecture, composition, calcite texture and local mechanical properties of the tergite cuticle, with particular emphasis on large anterior cuticle tubercles and differences between the anterior and posterior tergite. Unexpectedly, structure and thickness of the epicuticle resemble those in mesic isopod species. The anterior tergite has a thicker endocuticle and a higher local stiffness than the posterior tergite. Calcite distribution in the cuticle is unusual, because in addition to the exocuticle the endocuticle distally also contains calcite. The calcite consists of a distal layer of dense and highly co-oriented crystal-units, followed proximally by irregularly distributed and, with respect to each other, misoriented calcite crystallites. The calcite layer at the tip of the tubercle is thicker relative to the tubercle slopes, and its crystallites are more misoriented to each other. A steep decrease of local stiffness and hardness is observed within a distal region of the cuticle, likely caused by a successive increase in the ACC/calcite ratio rather than changes in the degree of mineralisation. Comparison of the results with other isopods reveals a much lower ACC/calcite ratio in H. reaumuri and a correlation between the degree of terrestriality of isopod species and the magnesium content of the cuticle.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The glycophosphoprotein osteopontin, a potent inhibitor of mineralization normally degraded by PHEX, accumulates within the bone matrix. Conventional therapy consisting of supplementation with phosphate and vitamin D analogs is burdensome and the effects on bone material poorly characterized. We analyzed transiliac bone biopsies from four adult patients, two of them severely affected due to no diagnosis and no treatment until adulthood. We used light microscopy, qBEI and FTIRI to study histology, histomorphometry, bone mineralization density distribution, properties of the organic matrix and size of hypomineralized periosteocytic lesions. Non-treatment resulted in severe osteomalacia, twice the amount of mineralized trabecular volume, multiple osteon-like perforations, continuity of lamellae from mineralized to unmineralized areas and distinctive patches of woven bone. Periosteocytic lesions were larger than in treated patients. The latter had nearly normal osteoid thicknesses, although surface was still elevated. The median calcium content of the matrix was always within normal range, although the percentage of lowly mineralized bone areas was highly increased in non-treated patients, resulting in a marked heterogeneity in mineralization. Divalent collagen cross-links were evident independently of the mineral content of the matrix. Broad osteoid seams lacked measurable pyridinoline, a mature trivalent cross-link and exhibited considerable acidic lipid content, typically found in matrix vesicles.

Raman and Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopies and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are applied to investigate the CaCO3 structure in various parts of the Calappa granulata crab exoskeleton. The shape of the main Raman peak of CaCO3 reveals the presence of two phases which are identified as calcite and amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). The relative concentration of the two phases in various parts of the exoskeleton is determined from the area ratio under the corresponding peaks. The results of the Ca L3,2-edge NEXAFS analysis are in line with the Raman findings, since the energy separation of peaks that appear in the lower frequency region of the main L2 and L3 peaks due to crystal field splitting, is directly related to the percentage of the ACC phase in the total CaCO3 mineral content. The C K-edge spectra are used for the determination of the extent of calcification of the exoskeleton. Furthermore, dark and bright field TEM images reveal the presence of nanocrystallites with an average size of 20 nm.

Among these, the p21-activated kinase (PAK) group strongly favors phosphorylation of Ser over Thr residues. PAK4, a group II PAK, almost exclusively phosphorylates its substrates on serine residues. The only well documented exception is LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), which is phosphorylated on an activation loop threonine (Thr508) to promote its catalytic activity. To understand the molecular and kinetic basis for PAK4 substrate selectivity we compared its mode of recognition of LIMK1 (Thr508) with that of a known serine substrate, β-catenin (Ser675). We determined X-ray crystal structures of PAK4 in complex with synthetic peptides corresponding to its phosphorylation sites in LIMK1 and β-catenin to 1.9 Å and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. We found that the PAK4 DFG+1 residue, a key determinant of phosphoacceptor preference, adopts a sub-optimal orientation when bound to LIMK1 compared to β-catenin. In peptide kinase activity assays, we find that phosphoacceptor identity impacts catalytic efficiency but does not affect the Km value for both phosphorylation sites. Although catalytic efficiency of wild-type LIMK1 and β-catenin are equivalent, T508S mutation of LIMK1 creates a highly efficient substrate.

Its inhibitory proteins, including uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) and p56, tightly bind to the active site of UNG by mimicking the DNA substrates. As the binding motifs are conserved in UNG family proteins, the inhibitory proteins bind to various UNG proteins across species. However, the intercalation residue that penetrates the DNA minor groove during uracil excision is not conserved among UNG proteins. To understand the role of the intercalation residue in their binding to the inhibitory proteins, we prepared mutants of mimivirus UNG, measured the binding affinity between the UNG mutants and inhibitory proteins, and analyzed the interactions based on the crystal structures of mimivirus UNG mutants complexed with UGI. The results show that mimivirus UNG, which harbors Tyr as an intercalation residue, did not interact with the inhibitory proteins intrinsically, whereas mutations of the intercalation residue to Phe or Leu resulted in tight interactions with UGI and p56; mutation to Met resulted in tight interactions only with p56. The crystal structures revealed that Phe and Leu stabilize the interactions by fitting into the hydrophobic pocket of UGI. These results show that differences in size and hydrophobicity of the intercalation residues determine the interactions between UNG family proteins and the inhibitory proteins, UGI and p56.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Recent research suggests that there is a near weekly biorhythm that may exert an influence on human skeletal growth. Evidence for the timing of this biorhythm is retained in tooth enamel as the periodicity of Retzius lines. Studies report that Retzius periodicity (RP) relates to adult human stature and enamel thickness. Adult human stature is sexually dimorphic, and so is enamel thickness of maxillary third molars (M3) but not mandibular M3. Yet, previous studies report sex differences in RP are apparent in some populations but not others, and it is unknown if dimorphism in enamel thickness relates to RP. To further our understanding of this biorhythm we analysed sex-related variation in RP and its relationship with enamel thickness in a sample of M3's (n=94) from adults in Northern Britain. Results reveal RP was significantly higher in our sample of female molars compared to those of males, which is consistent with the previously reported correlation between the biorhythm and adult stature. The RP of maxillary M3 related to sex differences in enamel thickness, but this relationship was not present in mandibular M3. Our results support previous findings suggesting that this biorhythm is sexually dimorphic and provide the first evidence that RP may be one factor influencing sex differences in enamel thickness. Our study also shows that correlations between RP and enamel thickness appear to be most readily detected for tooth types with sufficiently wide ranges of enamel thickness variation, as is the case for maxillary but not mandibular M3.

 Abstract
 
 We report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 putative primase composed of the nsp7 and nsp8 proteins. We observed a dimer of dimers (2:2 nsp7-nsp8) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The structure revealed a fold with a helical core of the heterotetramer formed by both nsp7 and nsp8 that is flanked with two symmetry-related nsp8 β-sheet subdomains. It was also revealed that two hydrophobic interfaces one of approx. 1340 Å2 connects the nsp7 to nsp8 and a second one of approx. 950 Å2 connects the dimers and form the observed heterotetramer. Interestingly, analysis of the surface electrostatic potential revealed a putative RNA binding site that is formed only within the heterotetramer.

We present here a methodology considering different sources of distortions in order to isolate the very effect of the mutation. To validate our methodology, we consider a well-studied family with many single mutants: the human lysozyme. Most of the perturbations are expected to be at the very localisation of the mutation, but in many cases the effects are propagated at long range. We show that the distances between the mutated residue and the 5% most disturbed residues, exponentially decreases. One third of the affected residues are in direct contact with the mutated position; the remaining two thirds are potential allosteric effects. We confirm the reliability of the residues assigned as significantly perturbed by comparing our results to experimental studies. We confirm with the present method all the previously identified perturbations.

AAVs isolated from bats display low capsid protein sequence identities (<60%) to AAV2, AAV5, and other primate AAVs. Here we report the first capsid structure of a non-primate AAV which was isolated from bats. The capsid structure of BtAAV-10HB (10HB) was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction to 3.0 Å resolution. Comparison of empty and genome-containing particles showed that the capsid structures are almost identical except for an ordered nucleotide in a previously described nucleotide-binding pocket, the density in the 5-fold channel, and several amino acids with altered side chain conformations. Compared to other dependoparvoviruses, for example AAV2 and AAV5, 10HB displays unique structural features including insertions and deletions in capsid surface loops. Overall, the 10HB capsid structure superposes with an RMSD of 1.7 Å and 1.8 Å to AAV2 and AAV5, respectively. Currently all approved AAV human gene therapy biologics and vectors in clinical trials are based on primate isolates. However, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in the human population represents a hurdle to their use. 10HB capsids are capable of packaging AAV2 vector genomes and thus have potential as gene delivery vectors. Significantly, a screen with human sera showed lack of recognition by the 10HB capsid. Thus, the different capsid surface of 10HB vectors likely renders it ""invisible"" to potential pre-existing neutralizing human antibodies especially because this virus or similar variants do not exist in primate populations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Four molecular classes of β-lactamases have been described (A, B, C and D), however until recently the class D enzymes were thought to exist only in Gram-negative bacteria. In the last few years, class D enzymes have been discovered in several species of Gram-positive microorganisms, such as Bacillus and Clostridia, and an investigation of their kinetic and structural properties has begun in earnest. Interestingly, it was observed that some species of Bacillus produce two distinct class D β-lactamases, one highly active and the other with only basal catalytic activity. Analysis of amino acid sequences of active (BPU-1 from Bacillus pumilus) and inactive (BSU-2 from Bacillus subtilis and BAT-2 from Bacillus atrophaeus) enzymes suggests that presence of three additional amino acid residues in one of the surface loops of inefficient β-lactamases may be responsible for their severely diminished activity. Our structural and docking studies show that the elongated loop of these enzymes severely restricts binding of substrates. Deletion of the three residues from the loops of BSU-2 and BAT-2 β-lactamases relieves the steric hindrance and results in a significant increase in the catalytic activity of the enzymes. These data show that this surface loop plays an important role in modulation of the catalytic activity of Bacillus class D β-lactamases.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These ACs feature a conserved dimeric catalytic core architecture, either through homodimerization or through pseudo-heterodimerization of a tandem of two homologous catalytic domains, C1 and C2, on a single protein chain. The symmetric core features two active sites, but in the C1-C2 tandem one site degenerated into a regulatory center. Analyzing bacterial AC sequences, we identified a Pseudomonas aeruginosa AC-like protein (PaAClp) that shows a surprising swap of the catalytic domains, resulting in an unusual C2-C1 arrangement. We cloned and recombinantly produced PaAClp. The protein bound nucleotides but showed no AC or guanylyl cyclase activity, even in presence of a variety of stimulating ligands of other ACs. Solving the crystal structure of PaAClp revealed an overall structure resembling active class III ACs but pronounced shifts of essential catalytic residues and structural elements. The structure contains a tightly bound ATP, but in a binding mode not suitable for cAMP formation or ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that PaAClp acts as an ATP-binding protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is a component of the urea cycle and regulates the intracellular levels of L-arginine, which makes the arginase a target for treatment of vascular diseases and asthma. Mammalian arginases contain an unusual S-shaped motif located at the intermonomeric interface. Until now, the studies were limited to structural role of the motif. Then, our interest was focused on functional aspects and our hypothesis has been that the motif is essential for maintain the oligomeric state, having Arg308 as a central axis. Previously, we have shown that the R308A mutant is monomeric and re-associates to the trimeric-cooperative state in the presence of low concentrations of guanidine chloride. We have now mutated Asp204 that interacts with Arg308 in the neighbor subunit, and also we mutated Glu256, proposed as important for oligomerization. Concretely, the human arginase I mutants D204A, D204E, E256A, E256Q and E256D were generated and examined. No differences were observed in the kinetic parameters at pH 9.5 or in tryptophan fluorescence. However, the D204A and E256Q variants were monomeric. On the other hand, D204E and E256D proved to be trimeric and kinetically cooperative at pH 7,5, whereas hyperbolic kinetics was exhibited by E256A, also trimeric. The results obtained strongly support the importance of the interaction between Arg255 and Glu256 in the cooperative properties of arginase, and Asp204 would be relevant to maintain the oligomeric state through salt bridges with Arg255 and Arg308.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

They have diverse cellular roles, however MACPFs with pore-forming toxic function in venoms and poisons are very rare in animals. Here we present the structure of PmPV2, a MACPF toxin from the poisonous apple snail eggs, that can affect the digestive and nervous systems of potential predators. We report the three-dimensional structure of PmPV2, at 17.2 Å resolution determined by negative-stain electron microscopy and its solution structure by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We found that PV2s differ from nearly all MACPFs in two respects: it is a dimer in solution and protomers combine two immune proteins into an AB toxin. The MACPF chain is linked by a single disulfide bond to a tachylectin chain, and two heterodimers are arranged head-to-tail by non-covalent forces in the native protein. MACPF domain is fused with a putative new Ct-accessory domain exclusive to invertebrates. The tachylectin is a six-bladed β-propeller, similar to animal tectonins. We experimentally validated the predicted functions of both subunits and demonstrated for the first time that PV2s are true pore-forming toxins. The tachylectin ¨B¨ delivery subunit would bind to target membranes, and then the MACPF ¨A¨ toxic subunit would disrupt lipid bilayers forming large pores altering the plasma membrane conductance. These results indicate that PV2s toxicity evolved by linking two immune proteins where their combined preexisting functions gave rise to a new toxic entity with a novel role in defense against predation. This structure is an unparalleled example of protein exaptation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Herein, we use in situ atomic force microscopy and a simple delignification treatment to elucidate the nanoscale architecture of individual secondary cell wall layers. Advantages of this approach are: (i) minimal sample preparation that reduces the introduction of potential artifacts; (ii) prevention of structural rearrangements due to dehydration; (iii) increased accessibility to structural details masked by the lignin matrix; and (iv) possibility to complement results with other analytical techniques without sample manipulation. The methodology permits the visualization of parallel and helicoidally arranged microfibril aggregates in the S1 layer and the determination of lignin contribution to microfibril aggregates forming S2 layers. Cellulose and hemicelluloses constitute the core of the aggregates with a mean diameter of approximately 19 nm, and lignin encloses the core forming single structural entities of about 30 nm diameter. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of sample preparation and imaging parameters on the characterization of microfibril aggregates by AFM.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The shaft comprises two parts, the calamus and the rachis. The calamus is at the base of the shaft, while the rachis is the longer upper part which supports the vanes. The shaft is composed of a fibrous outer cortex, and an inner foam-like core. Recent nanoindentation experiments have indicated that reduced modulus values, Er, for the inner and outer regions of the cortex can vary, with the Er values of the inner region slightly greater than those of the outer region. In this work, Raman spectroscopy is used to investigate the protein secondary structures in the inner and outer regions of the feather cortex. Analysis of the Amide I region of Raman spectra taken from four birds (Swan, Gull, Mallard and Kestrel) shows that the β-sheet structural component decreases between the inner and outer region, relative to the protein side-chain components. This finding is consistent with the proposal that Er values are greater in the inner region than the outer region. This work has shown that Raman spectroscopy can be used effectively to study the change in protein secondary structure between the inner and outer regions of a feather shaft.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

During mastication huge compressive forces are concentrated in a tiny zone at the tooth-bone interface. We report on the structure of this bone, with emphasis on its contact with the teeth, at different hierarchical levels and in 3D. Micro-CT shows that the molariform teeth do not have roots and are supported by a circular narrow bony rim that surrounds the periphery of the tooth base. The lower pharyngeal jaw is highly porous, as seen by reflected light microscopy and secondary electron microscopy (SE-SEM), with porosity decreasing close to the bone-tooth interface, and back-scattered electron (BSE-SEM) microscopy showing a slight elevation in mineral density. Focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in the serial surface view (SSV) mode reveals a most surprising organization at the nanoscale level: parallel arrays of mineralized collagen fibrils surrounding channels of ∼ 100 nm diameter, both with their long axes oriented along the load direction.

Recently, amorphous ice embedding techniques have been associated with FIB-SEM to ensure that the biological material remains as close as possible to its native state. Here we have vitrified human HeLa cells and directly imaged them by cryo-FIB-SEM with the secondary electron InLens detector at cryogenic temperature and without any staining. Image stacks were aligned and processed by denoising, removal of ion beam milling artefacts and local charge imbalance. Images were assembled into a 3D volume and the major cell constituents were modelled. The data illustrate the power of the workflow to provide a detailed view of the internal architecture of the fully hydrated, close-to-native, entire HeLa cell. In addition, we have studied the feasibility of combining cryo-FIB-SEM imaging with live-cell protein detection. We demonstrate that internalized gold particles can be visualized by detecting back scattered primary electrons at low kV while simultaneously acquiring signals from the secondary electron detector to image major cell features. Furthermore, gold-conjugated antibodies directed against RNA polymerase II could be observed in the endo-lysosomal pathway while labelling of the enzyme in the nucleus was not detected, a shortcoming likely due to the inadequacy between the size of the gold particles and the voxel size.

The EV-D68 genome encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 3Dpol, which is central for viral genome replication and considered as a promising target for specific antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we report the crystal structures of human EV-D68 RdRp in the apo state and in complex with the inhibitor NADPH, which was selected by using a structure-based virtual screening approach. The EV-D68-RdRp-NADPH complex is the first RdRp-inhibitor structure identified in the species Enterovirus D. The inhibitor NADPH occupies the RNA template binding channel of EV-D68 RdRp with a novel binding pocket. Additionally, residues involved in the NADPH binding pocket of EV-D68 RdRp are highly conserved in RdRps of enteroviruses. Therefore, the enzyme activity of three RdRps from EV-D68, poliovirus, and enterovirus A71 is shown to decrease when titrated with NADPH separately in vitro. Furthermore, we identified that NADPH plays a pivotal role as an RdRp inhibitor instead of a chain terminator during restriction of RNA-dependent RNA replication. In the future, derivatives of NADPH may pave the way for novel inhibitors of RdRp through compound modification, providing potential antiviral agents for treating enteroviral infection and related diseases.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The present investigation sought to provide biochemical data to validate specific features of these structures; with particular focus on the transmembrane domain that provides the transport conduit. Hence our focus was on transmembrane helices six and twelve (TM6/TM12), which are believed to participate in drug binding, as they line the central transport conduit and provide a direct link to the catalytic centres. A series of P-gp mutants were generated with a single cysteine in both TM6 and TM12 to facilitate measurement of inter-helical distances using cross-linking and DEER strategies. Experimental results were compared to published structures per se and those refined by MD simulations.

While its exact biological function is not clear, DPEP3 expression is normally limited to testis , but can be elevated in ovarian cancer. Antibody drug conjugates targeting DPEP3 have shown efficacy in preclinical models with a pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugate, SC-003, dosed in a phase I clinical trial (NCT02539719). Here we reveal the novel atomic structure of DPEP3 alone and in complex with the SC-003 Fab fragment at 1.8 and 2.8 Å, respectively. The structure of DPEP3/SC-003 Fab complex reveals an eighteen-residue epitope across the DPEP3 dimerization interface distinct from the enzymatic active site. DPEP1 and DPEP3 extracellular domains share a conserved, dimeric TIM (β/α)8-barrel fold, consistent with 49% sequence identity. However, DPEP3 diverges from DPEP1 and DPEP2 in key positions of its active site: a histidine to tyrosine variation at position 269 reduces affinity for the β zinc and may cause substrate steric hindrance, whereas an aspartate to asparagine change at position 359 abolishes activation of the nucleophilic water/hydroxide, resulting in no in vitro activity against a variety of dipeptides and biological substrates (imipenem, leukotriene D4 and cystinyl-bis-glycine). Hence DPEP3, unlike DPEP1 and DPEP2, may require an activating co-factor in vivo or may remain an inactive, degenerate enzyme. This report sheds light on the structural discriminants between active and inactive membrane dipeptidases and provides a benchmark to characterize current and future DPEP3-targeted therapeutic approaches.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The influence of this organization on the intrinsic local dynamics of DNA is largely unknown, in particular because capturing such information from experiments remains notoriously challenging. Given the importance of dynamical properties in DNA functions, we addressed this issue using MD simulations of a nucleosome containing the NCP positioning 601 sequence and four related free dodecamers. Comparison between DNANCP and free DNA reveals a limited impact of the dense DNA-histone interface on correlated motions of dinucleotide constituents and on fluctuations of inter base pair parameters. A characteristic feature intimately associated with the DNANCP super-helical path is a set of structural periodicities that includes a marked alternation of regions enriched in backbone BI and BII conformers. This observation led to uncover a convincing correspondence between the sequence effect on BI/BII propensities in both DNANCP and free DNA, strengthening the idea that the histone preference for particular DNA sequences relies on those intrinsic structural properties. These results offer for the first time a detailed view of the DNA dynamical behavior within NCP. They show in particular that the DNANCP dynamics is substantial enough to preserve the ability to structurally adjust to external proteins, for instance remodelers. Also, fresh structural arguments highlight the relevance of relationships between DNA sequence and structural properties for NCP formation. Overall, our work offers a more rational framework to approach the functional, biological roles of NCP.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Most of them produce an external calcified shell, resulting from the secretory activity of a specialized epithelium of the calcifying mantle. This biomineralization process is controlled by a set of extracellular macromolecules, the organic matrix. In spite of several studies, these components are mainly known for bivalves and gastropods. In the present study, we investigated the physical and biochemical properties of the internal planispiral shell of the Ram's Horn squid Spirula spirula. Scanning Electron Microscope investigations of the shell reveal a complex microstructural organization. The saccharides constitute a quantitatively important moiety of the matrix, as shown by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified β-chitin and additional polysaccharides for a total amount of 80% of the insoluble fraction. Proteomics was applied to both soluble and insoluble matrices and in silico searches were performed, first on heterologous metazoans models, and secondly on an unpublished transcriptome of Spirula spirula. In the first case, several peptides were identified, some of them matching with tyrosinase, chitinase 2, protease inhibitor, or immunoglobulin. In the second case, 39 hits were obtained, including transferrin, a serine protease inhibitor, matrilin, or different histones. The very few similarities with known molluscan shell matrix proteins suggest that Spirula spirula uses a unique set of shell matrix proteins for constructing its internal shell.

However, little is known about the relationships between diet and tooth microstructure and composition in teleost fishes. In this work, we describe the external morphology, internal microstructure and elemental composition of the oral teeth of three representative species of the family Serrasalmidae having different feeding habits (herbivorous vs. omnivorous vs. carnivorous). We used backscattered-electron imaging and low vacuum environmental scanning electron microscope to compare the organization and mineralization of tooth layers as well as energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis and Raman microspectrometry to investigate the elemental composition, Ca/P ratio and mineralogy of the most superficial layers. Oral teeth of each serrasalmid species have the same internal organization based on five distinctive layers (i.e. pulp, dentine, inner enameloid, outer enameloid and cuticle) but the general tooth morphology is different according to diet. Microstructural and compositional variation of the cuticle and iron-enrichment of superficial layers were highlighted between herbivorous and carnivorous species. Iron is more concentrated in teeth of the herbivorous species where it is associated with a thicker cuticle explaining the more intense red-pigmentation of the cutting edges of oral teeth. The iron-enrichment is interpreted as a substitution of Ca by Fe in the hydroxyapatite. These traits are discussed in the light of the evolutionary history of the family. Further considerations and hypotheses about the formation and origin of the mineralized tooth layers and especially the iron-rich superficial layers in teleost fishes are suggested.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The SpeG enzyme from B. thuringiensis (BtSpeG) binds polyamines in its allosteric site and adopts a dodecameric oligomeric state similar to other SpeG enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria. Our kinetic results show the catalytic efficiency of BtSpeG was greater than any previously characterized SpeG to date, and in contrast to other SpeG proteins it exhibited very similar kinetic properties toward both spermine and spermidine. Similar to the SpeG enzyme from E. coli, BtSpeG was able to acetylate spermidine on the N1 and N8 positions. The turnover of BtSpeG toward spermine and spermidine was also two to three orders of magnitude greater than any other Bacilli SSAT enzyme that has been previously characterized.

In a previous work we showed that it is formed by an endocytic event that we called megapinocytosis. The megapinosome is filled with a membrane surrounded trabecular meshwork that is topologically part of the cytosol. In this work we used scanning transmission electron tomography on high pressure frozen and freeze substituted human macrophages in order to unravel the three-dimensional structure of both the megapinosome and the adjacent structures. The megapinosome consists of the trabecular meshwork and the lacunae which are connected with and topologically equivalent to the cytosol.

We report the first comprehensive structural and biomolecular study of Spondylus gaederopus, a pectinoid bivalve with a peculiar shell texture. Used since prehistoric times, this is the best-known shell of Europe's cultural heritage. We find that Spondylus microstructure is very poor in mineral-bound organics, which are mostly intercrystalline and concentrated at the interface between structural layers. Using high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) we characterized several shell protein fractions, isolated following different bleaching treatments. Several peptides were identified as well as six shell proteins, which display features and domains typically found in biomineralized tissues, including the prevalence of intrinsically disordered regions. It is very likely that these sequences only partially represent the full proteome of Spondylus, considering the lack of genomics data for this genus and the fact that most of the reconstructed peptides do not match with any known shell proteins, representing consequently lineage-specific sequences. This work sheds light onto the shell matrix involved in the biomineralization in spondylids.

This response to tension that enables their physiological function is related to the ability to dynamically regulate their elasticity. The unique arrangement of their individual mechanical components (proteins and polymeric linkers), and the interactions between them eventually determines their performance. The sequential unfolding-times within a polyprotein are inherently assumed to be independent and identically distributed (iid), thus expected to follow an exponential distribution. Nevertheless, a large body of literature using single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) provides evidence that forced unfolding-times of N proteins within a polyprotein do not follow the exponential distribution. Here we use SMFS with Atomic Force Microscopy to measure the unfolding kinetics of Poly-(I91)8 at 180 pN. The unfolding time-intervals were statistically analysed using three common approaches, all exhibiting an N-effect: hierarchical behavior with non-identical unfolding time distributions. Using continuous time random walk approach indicates that the unfolding times display subdiffusive features. Put together with free-energy reconstruction of the whole unfolding polyprotein, we provide physical explanation for this nontrivial behavior, according to which the elongating polypeptide chain with each unfolding event intervenes with the sequential unfolding probabilities and correlates them.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In E. coli the last three steps of the β-oxidation are catalyzed by two heterotetrameric α2β2 enzymes namely the aerobic trifunctional enzyme (EcTFE) and the anaerobic TFE (anEcTFE). The α subunit of TFE has 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) and 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activities whereas the β subunit is a thiolase with 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT) activity. Recently, it has been shown that the two TFEs have complementary substrate specificities allowing for the complete degradation of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs into acetyl-CoA under aerobic conditions. Also, it has been shown that the tetrameric EcTFE and anEcTFE assemblies are similar to the TFEs of Pseudomans fragi and human, respectively. Here the properties of the EcTFE subunits are further characterized. Strikingly, it is observed that when expressed separately, EcTFE-α is a catalytically active monomer whereas EcTFE-β is inactive. However, when mixed together active EcTFE tetramer is reconstituted. The crystal structure of the EcTFE-α chain is also reported, complexed with ATP, bound in its HAD active site. Structural comparisons show that the EcTFE hydratase active site has a relatively small fatty acyl tail binding pocket when compared to other TFEs in good agreement with its preferred specificity for short chain 2E-enoyl-CoA substrates. Furthermore, it is observed that millimolar concentrations of ATP destabilize the EcTFE complex, and this may have implications for the ATP-mediated regulation of β-oxidation in E. coli.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Lactoglobulin has shown great potential for use in targeted drug delivery and body fluid detoxification because of its ability to bind a variety of molecules. In order to modify the biophysical properties of β-lactoglobulin, a series of single-site mutations were designed using a structure-based approach. A 3-dimensional structure alignment of homologous molecules led to the design of nine β-lactoglobulin variants with mutations introduced in the binding pocket region. Seven stable and correctly folded variants (L39Y, I56F, L58F, V92F, V92Y, F105L, M107L) were thoroughly characterized by fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, size-exclusion chromatography, and X-ray structural investigations. The effects of the amino acid substitutions were observed as slight rearrangements of the binding pocket geometry, but they also significantly influenced the global properties of the protein. Most of the mutations increased the thermal/chemical stability without altering the dimerization constant or pH-dependent conformational behavior. The crystal structures reveal that the I56F and F105L mutations reduced the depth of the binding pocket, which is advantageous since it can reduce the affinity to endogenous fatty acids. The F105L mutant created a unique binding mode for a fatty acid, supporting the idea that lactoglobulin can be altered to bind unique molecules. Selected variants possessing a unique combination of their individual properties can be used for further, more advanced mutagenesis, and the presented results support further research using β-lactoglobulin as a therapeutic delivery agent or a blood detoxifying molecule.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The mineral phase of otoconia is calcite, which coherently diffracts X-rays much like a single-crystal. Otoconia contain osteopontin (OPN), a mineral-binding protein influencing mineralization processes in bones, teeth and avian eggshells, for example, and in pathologic mineral deposits. Here we describe mineral nanostructure and the distribution of OPN in mouse otoconia. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy of intact and cleaved mouse otoconia revealed an internal nanostructure (∼50 nm). Transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography of focused ion beam-prepared sections of otoconia confirmed this mineral nanostructure, and identified even smaller (∼10 nm) nanograin dimensions. X-ray diffraction of mature otoconia (8-day-old mice) showed crystallite size in a similar range (73 nm and smaller). Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy - both methods being sensitive to the detection of crystalline and amorphous forms in the sample - showed no evidence of amorphous calcium carbonate in these mature otoconia. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy combined with colloidal-gold immunolabeling for OPN revealed that this protein was located at the surface of the otoconia, correlating with a site where surface nanostructure was observed. OPN addition to calcite growing in vitro produced similar surface nanostructure. Finally, these findings provide details on the composition and nanostructure of mammalian otoconia, and suggest that while OPN may influence surface rounding and surface nanostructure in otoconia, other incorporated proteins (also possibly including OPN) likely participate in creating internal nanostructure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Through a complex enzootic cycle, the bacteria transfer between two different hosts: Ixodes ticks and mammalian organisms. At the start of the tick blood meal, the spirochetes located in the tick gut upregulate the expression of several genes, mainly coding for outer surface proteins. Outer surface proteins belonging to the paralogous gene family 54 (PFam54) have been shown to be the most upregulated among the other borrelial proteins and the results clearly point to the potential importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. The significance of PFam54 proteins is confirmed by the fact that of all ten PFam54 proteins, BBA64 and BBA66 are necessary for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from infected Ixodes ticks to mammalian hosts. To enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and to promote the development of novel therapies against Lyme disease, we solved the crystal structure of the PFam54 member BBA65. Additionally, we report the structure of the B. burgdorferi BBA64 orthologous protein from B. spielmanii. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of five PFam54 members and several related proteins, we performed a comprehensive structural analysis for this important group of proteins.

In this study, we test the hypothesis of a link between thermal stability of LDHs and their capacity against unfolding induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by γ-rays irradiation. By using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we analysed that high thermal stability of a thermophilic LDH favours strong resistance against ROS-induced unfolding, in contrast to its psychrophilic and mesophilic counterparts that are less resistant. We suggest that a protein's phenotype linking strong thermal stability and resistance against ROS damages would have been a selective evolutionary advantage. We also find that the enzymatic activity of the thermophilic LDH that is strongly resistant against ROS-unfolding is very sensitive to inactivation by irradiation. To address this counter-intuitive observation, we combined mass spectrometry analyses and enzymatic activity measurements. We demonstrate that the dramatic change on LDH activity was linked to remote chemical modifications away from the active site, that change the equilibrium between low-affinity tense (T-inactive) and high-affinity relaxed (R-active) forms. We found the T-inactive thermophilic enzyme obtained after irradiation can recover its LDH activity by addition of the allosteric effector 1, 6 fructose bis phosphate. We analyse our data within the general framework of allosteric regulation, which requires that an enzyme in solution populates a large diversity of dynamically-interchanging conformations.

In this study, we evaluate scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM for characterizing the formation and shedding of vesicles from human breast cell lines, parental and hyaluronan synthase 3-(HAS3)-overexpressing MCF10A cells grown directly on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids. While cells imaged with conventional- and cryo-SEM exhibit distinct morphologies due to the sample preparation process for each technique, tubular structures protruding from the cell surfaces were observed with both approaches. For HAS3-MCF10A cells, vesicles were present along the length of membrane protrusions. Once completely shed from the cells, extracellular vesicles were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and cryo-TEM. The size distributions obtained by each technique were different not only in the range of vesicles analyzed, but also in the relative proportion of smaller-to-larger vesicles. These differences are attributed to the presence of biological debris in the media, which is difficult to differentiate from vesicles in NTA.

Understanding the mechanism of regulation within these families is important due to their roles in controlling the cell concentration of a range of fatty acids and CoA-bound compounds.

Each scale is composed of anvil-shaped single crystals of calcite that are mechanically interlocked, constituting a remarkable example of the multi-level construction of mineralized structures. Coccolith formation starts with the nucleation of rhombohedral crystals on an organic substrate called base plate. The crystals then grow preferentially along specific directions to generate the mature structure, which is then transported to the outside of the cells. Here, we extracted forming coccoliths from Pleurochrysis carterae cells and used cryo-electron tomography to characterize, in their native, hydrated state, the three-dimensional morphology and arrangement of the crystals. Comparing the crystal morphology across three different stages of coccolith formation, we show that competition for space between adjacent crystals contributes significantly to regulation of morphology by constraining growth in certain directions.

Thus a continuum so seems to exist between rigidity, flexibility and disorder. However, it had not been precisely described. In this study, we used an ensemble of disordered proteins (or regions) and, we applied a structural alphabet to analyse their local conformation. This structural alphabet, namely Protein Blocks, had been efficiently used to highlight rigid local domains within flexible regions and so discriminates deformability and mobility concepts. Using an entropy index derived from this structural alphabet, we underlined its interest to measure these local dynamics, and to quantify, for the first time, continuum states from rigidity to flexibility and finally disorder.

The C-terminal prenyltransferase αdomain generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate which is then cyclized to form copalyl diphosphate at the N-terminal βγ domain interface. We now demonstrate that PvCPS exists as a hexamer at high concentrations - a unique quaternary structure for known αβγ terpene synthases. Hexamer assembly is corroborated by a 2.41 Å-resolution crystal structure of the α domain prenyltransferase obtained from limited proteolysis of full-length PvCPS, as well as the ab initio modeling of full-length PvCPS derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. Hexamerization of the prenyltransferase αdomain appears to drive the hexamerization of full-length PvCPS. The PvCPS hexamer dissociates into lower-order species at lower concentrations, as evidenced by size-exclusion chromatography in-line with multiangle light scattering, sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments, suggesting that oligomerization is concentration dependent.

We found that while stereocilia actin filaments run 13nm apart in parallel for long distances, there were gaps of significant size that were stochastically distributed throughout the actin core. Actin crosslinkers were distributed through the stereocilium, but did not occupy all possible binding sites. At stereocilia tips, protein density extended beyond actin filaments, especially on the side of the tip where a tip link is expected to anchor. Along the shaft, repeating density was observed that corresponds to actin-to-membrane connectors. In the taper region, most actin filaments terminated near the plasma membrane. The remaining filaments twisted together to make a tighter bundle than was present in the shaft region; the spacing between them decreased from 13 nm to 9 nm, and the apparent filament diameter decreased from 6.4 to 4.8 nm. Our models illustrate detailed features of distinct structural domains that are present within the stereocilium.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In testicular biology, for example, the study of spermatogenesis and the use of spermatogonial stem cells offer high-impact applications in fertility medicine and reproductive biotechnology. The objective of our study is to apply optical clearing, immunofluorescence, and confocal microscopy to testicular tissue in order to reconstruct its three-dimensional microstructure in intact samples. We used Triton-X/DMSO clearing in combination with refractive index matching to achieve optical transparency of fixed mouse testes. An antibody against smooth muscle actin was used to label peritubular myoid cells of seminiferous tubules while an antibody against ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase was used to label Sertoli cells and spermatogonia in the seminiferous epithelium. Specimens were then imaged using confocal fluorescence microscopy. We were able to successfully clear testicular tissue and utilize immunofluorescent probes. Additionally, we successfully visualized the histological compartments of testicular tissue in three-dimensional reconstructions. Optical clearing combined with immunofluorescence and confocal imaging offers a powerful new method to analyze the cytoarchitecture of testicular tissue at histological resolution while maintaining the macro-scale perspective of the intact system.

Current practice of spectral quasi B-factor flattening.,"The analysis of structure factors in 3D cryo-EM Coulomb potential maps and their ""enhancement"" at the end of the reconstruction process is a well-established practice, normally referred to as sharpening. The aim is to increase contrast and, in this way, to help tracing the atomic model. The most common way to accomplish this enhancement is by means of the so-called B-factor correction, which applies a global filter to boost high frequencies with some dampening considerations related to noise amplification. The results are maps with a better visual aspect and a quasiflat spectrum at medium and high frequencies. This practice is so widespread that most map depositions in the Electron Microscopy Data Base (EMDB) only contain sharpened maps. Here, the use in cryoEM of global B-factor corrections is theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Results clearly illustrate that protein spectra present a falloff. Thus, spectral quasi-flattening may produce protein spectra with distortions when compared with experimental ones, this fact, combined with the practice of reporting only sharpened maps, generates a sub-optimal situation in terms of data preservation, reuse and reproducibility. Now that the field is more advanced, we put forward two suggestions: (1) to use methods which keep more faithfully the original experimental signal properties of macromolecules when ""enhancing"" the map, and (2) to further stress the need to deposit the original experimental maps without any postprocessing or sharpening, not only the enhanced maps. In the absence of access to these original maps data is lost, preventing their future analysis with new methods.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The algorithm can be used to enhance our recently reported computational design pipeline (Jain et. al, NAR 2018). The RAG approah reresents RNA secondary structures as tree and dual graphs, where RNA loops and helices are coarse-grained as vertices and edges, opening the usage of graph theory methods to study, predict, and design RNA structures. Our recently developed computational pipeline for design utilizes graph partitioning (RAG-3D) and atomic fragment assembly (F-RAG) to design sequences to fold onto RNA-like tree graph topologies; the atomic fragments are taken from existing RNA structures that correspond to tree subgraphs. Because F-RAG may not produce the target folds for all designs, automated mutations by RAG-IF algorithm enhance the candidate pool markedly. The crucial residues for mutation are identified by differences between the predicted and the target topology. A genetic algorithm then mutates the selected residues, and the successful sequences are optimized to retain only the minimal or essential mutations. Here we evaluate RAG-IF for 6 RNA-like topologies and generate a large pool of successful candidate sequences with a variety of minimal mutations. We find that RAG-IF adds robustness and efficiency to our RNA design pipeline, making inverse folding motivated by graph topology rather than secondary structure more productive.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Incorporation of β -amino acids in vivo requires the development of efficient aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific of these non-canonical amino acids. Here, we have performed a detailed structural and biochemical study of the recognition and use of β3-Met by Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). We show that MetRS binds β3-Met with a 24-fold lower affinity but catalyzes the esterification of the non-canonical amino acid onto tRNA with a rate lowered by three orders of magnitude. Accurate measurements of the catalytic parameters required careful consideration of the presence of contaminating α-Met in β3-Met commercial samples. The 1.45 Å crystal structure of the MetRS: β3-Met complex shows that β3-Met binds the enzyme essentially like α -Met, but the carboxylate moiety is mobile and not adequately positioned to react with ATP for aminoacyl adenylate formation.

Directed evolution and in vivo screening in the mouse retina isolated this vector. In the present study, we sought to identify the structural differences between a recombinant AAV2.7m8 (rAAV2.7m8) vector packaging a GFP genome and its parental serotype, AAV2, by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image reconstruction. The structures of rAAV2.7m8 and AAV2 were determined to 2.91 and 3.02 Å resolution, respectively. The rAAV2.7m8 amino acid side-chains for residues 219-745 (the last C-terminal residue) were interpretable in the density map with the exception of the 10 inserted amino acids. While observable in a low sigma threshold density, side-chains were only resolved at the base of the insertion, likely due to flexibility at the top of the loop. A comparison to parental AAV2 (ordered from residues 217-735) showed the structures to be similar, except at some side-chains that had different orientations and, in VR-VIII containing the 10 amino acid insertion. VR-VIII is part of an AAV2 antigenic epitope, and the difference is consistent with rAAV2.7m8's escape from a known AAV2 monoclonal antibody, C37-B.

In corals, it’s been suggested that proteins such as Coral Acid Rich Proteins (CARPs) play a major role in the polymorph selection of their calcium carbonate (CaCO3) aragonite exoskeleton. To date, four CARPs (1–4) have been characterized: each with a different amino acid composition and different temporal and spatial expression patterns during coral developmental stages. Interestingly, CARP3 is able to alter crystallization pathways in vitro, yet its function in this process remains enigmatic. To better understand the CARP3 function, we performed two independent in vitro CaCO3 polymorph selection experiments using purified recombinant CARP3 at different concentrations and at low or zero Mg2+ concentration. Our results show that, in the absence of Mg2+, CARP3 selects for the vaterite polymorph and inhibits calcite. However, in the presence of a low concentration of Mg2+ and CARP3 both Mg-calcite and vaterite are formed, with the relative amount of Mg-calcite increasing with CARP3 concentration. In all conditions, CARP3 did not select for the aragonite polymorph, which is the polymorph associated to CARP3 in vivo, even in the presence of Mg2+ (Mg:Ca molar ratio equal to 1). These results further emphasize the importance of Mg:Ca molar ratios similar to that in seawater (Mg:Ca equal to 5) and the activity of the biological system in a aragonite polymorph selection in coral skeleton formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Progesterone injected 2 h post-oviposition (P4-2 h) improved eggshell quality with a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in the thickness of the mammillary layer and a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the thickness of the effective layer in the eggshell ultrastructure compared to the control. Progesterone injected 5 h post-oviposition (P4-5 h) damaged the eggshell quality by significantly reducing (P < 0.01) the effective layer thickness. Progesterone injected delayed obviously (P < 0.01) the following oviposition. Moreover, the concentrations of Thr, Cys, Leu, Lys, and His in the eggshell membranes were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the P4-2 h treated hens whereas Val and Lys were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in P4-5 h treated hens compared to the control. Therefore, progesterone shows paradoxical effects on eggshell quality depending on the injection time-points post-oviposition, which could explain the contradictions in previous related reports. P4 injected affected the content of amino acids in eggshell membranes, especially lysine which contributed to eggshell quality. In addition, P4 injected 2 h after oviposition improved eggshell quality by promoting the premature fusion of mammillary knobs. This work contributed to a novel insight to understanding the mechanism of improving eggshell quality.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Solution X-ray scattering data indicates that the phospho-mimetic forms of the Wag31 polymers are on average more compact than their phospho-ablative counterparts, which is likely due to the extent of bending/branching.

Several experimental and computational analyses have been conducted to study structural pliability and functional potential of IDPs. In spite of active research in past few decades, what induces structural disorder in IDPs and how is still elusive. Many studies testify that sequential and spatial neighbours often play important roles in determining structural and functional behaviour of proteins. Considering this fact, we assessed sequence neighbours of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to understand if they have any role to play in inducing structural flexibility in IDPs. Our analysis includes 97% eukaryotic IDPs and 3% from bacteria and viruses. Physicochemical and structural parameters including amino acid propensity, hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity, relative solvent accessibility, B-factor and atomic packing density are used to characterise the neighbouring residues of IDRs (NRIs). We show that NRIs exhibit a unique nature, which makes them stand out from both ordered and disordered residues. They show correlative occurrences of residue pairs like Ser-Thr and Gln-Asn, indicating their tendency to avoid strong biases of order or disorder promoting amino acids. We also find differential preferences of amino acids between N- and C-terminal neighbours, which might indicate a plausible directional effect on the dynamics of adjacent IDRs. We designed an efficient prediction tool using Random Forest to distinguish the NRIs from the ordered residues. Our findings will contribute to understand the behaviour of IDPs, and may provide potential lead in deciphering the role of IDRs in protein folding and assembly.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Multivariate data analysis is applied to a large set of overlapping subvolumes extracted semiautomatically from the viral envelope and does not utilize a template of the target structure. The major manual step used in the method involves determination of six points that define an ellipsoid approximating the virion shape. The approach is robust to departures of the actual virion from this starting ellipsoid. A point cage of sufficient density is generated to ensure that any spike-like protein is identified multiple times. Subsequently translational alignment of class averages to a cylindrical reference on a curved surface separates subvolumes with spikes from those without. Spike containing subvolumes identified multiple times are removed by proximity analysis. Slightly different procedures segment spikes in the equatorial and the polar regions. Once all spikes are segmented, further alignment of class averages using separately the polar and spin angles produces recognizable spike images. Our approach localized 96% of the equatorial spikes and 85% of all spikes identified manually; it identifies a significant number of additional spikes missed by manual selection. Two types of spike shapes were segmented, one with near 3-fold symmetry resembling the conventional spike, the other had a T-shape resembling the spike structure obtained when antibodies such as PG9 bind to HIV Env.

Biosynthetic pathway of Choi is still elusive. AerF was suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of Choi, and can be assigned to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. However, both the exact role and the catalytic mechanism of AerF have not been elucidated. In this study, functional and mechanistic analyses of AerF from Microcystis aeruginosa were performed. Observation of enzymatic assay demonstrates that AerF is a NADPH-dependent alkenal double bond reductase that catalyzes the reduction of dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (H2HPP) to generate tetrahydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (H4HPP), which is the third step of the biosynthetic pathway from prephenate to Choi. Comparative structural analysis indicates that ligand binding-induced conformational change of AerF is different from that of the other SDR superfamily reductase using H2HPP as a substrate. Analyses of NADPH and substrate analogue binding sites combined with the results of mutagenesis analyses suggest that a particular serine residue mainly involves in the initiation of the proton transfer between the substrate and the residues of AerF, which is an uncommon feature in SDR superfamily reductase.

Nonetheless, challenging targets need extensive sample screening, often of many cryo-EM sample grids prepared under various conditions. We have designed and made tools for manipulating sample grids in storage cases. These tools are made of a plastic fiber using a wide-use 3D printer, a fused deposition modeling type, and polished under acetone gas. A grid case stacker organizes many frozen-hydrated cryo-EM grids and the stackers can be piled up inside a standard 50mL centrifuge tube. We have also introduced tools that facilitate handling of grid cases under liquid nitrogen and a stocker of the grid retainers contained in a CRYO ARM electron microscope.

Here, we investigate the conformational properties of the tetrasaccharide building block of the Lytechinus variegatus sulfated fucan composed of the following structure [l-Fucp4(SO3-)-α(1-3)-l-Fucp2,4(SO3-)-α(1-3)-l-Fucp2(SO3-)-α(1-3)-l-Fucp2(SO3-)] and the composing monosaccharide unit Fucp, primarily by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments performed at very low temperatures and using H2O as the solvent for the sugars rather than using the conventional deuterium oxide. By slowing down the fast chemical exchange rates and forcing the protonation of labile sites, we increased the number of through-space 1H-1H distances that could be measured by NMR spectroscopy. Following this strategy, additional conformational details of the tetrasaccharide and l-Fucp in solution were obtained. Computational molecular dynamics was performed to complement and validate the NMR-based measurements. A model of the NMR-restrained 3D structure is offered for the tetrasaccharide.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These sandwiches are, in turn, related to one another by a left-handed four-fold screw axis to generate a helical structure that forms the core of the 3.4 nm diameter filaments observed by electron microscopy and deduced from X-ray fibre diffraction. Recently, it has been shown that one ß-keratin chain, with a molecular weight approximately twice that of the majority of ß-keratin chains, is conserved across the lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes and tuatara). Uniquely, it contains four 34-residue repeats. Although this chain is a minor component the observation that the entire chain shows a high degree of sequence conservation between species suggests an important structural/functional role in vivo. Modelling shows that only six families of structures are physically possible. In three of these the repeats exist within a single filament and might therefore act in a filament nucleation role. In the second three families the repeats exist in two, three or four filaments, implying that their function may be to act as an inter-filament crosslinker, thereby providing lateral reinforcement to the epidermal appendage. The favoured model is one in which the first two repeats form a β-sandwich in one filament and the second two repeats form a β-sandwich in a neighbouring filament.

Dystrophin deficiency leads to the severe muscle wasting disease Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and the milder allelic variant, Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD and BMD). Previous work has shown that concomitant interaction of the actin binding domain 2 (ABD2) comprising spectrin like repeats 11 to 15 (R11-15) of the central domain of dystrophin, with both actin and membrane lipids, can greatly increase membrane stiffness. Based on a combination of SAXS and SANS measurements, mass spectrometry analysis of cross-linked complexes and interactive low-resolution simulations, we explored in vitro the molecular properties of dystrophin that allow the formation of ABD2-F-actin and ABD2-membrane model complexes. In dystrophin we identified two subdomains interacting with F-actin, one located in R11 and a neighbouring region in R12 and another one in R15, while a single lipid binding domain was identified at the C-terminal end of R12. Relative orientations of the dystrophin central domain with F-actin and a membrane model were obtained from docking simulation under experimental constraints. SAXS-based models were then built for an extended central subdomain from R4 to R19, including ABD2. Overall results are compatible with a potential F-actin / dystrophin / membrane lipids ternary complex. Our description of this selected part of the dystrophin associated complex bridging muscle cell membrane and cytoskeleton opens the way to a better understanding of how cell muscle scaffolding is maintained through this essential protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

 Abstract
 
 Hemagglutnin (HA) mediates entry of influenza virus through a series of conformational changes triggered by the low pH of the endosome. The residue or combination of residues acting as pH sensors has not yet been fully elucidated. In this work, we assay pH effects on the structure of H5 HA by soaking HA crystallized at pH 6.5 in a series of buffers with lower pH, mimicking the conditions of the endosome. We find that HA1-H38, which is conserved in Group 1 HA, undergoes a striking change in side chain conformation, which we attribute to its protonation and cation-cation repulsion with conserved HA1-H18. This work suggests that x-ray crystallography can be applied for studying small-scale pH-induced conformational changes providing valuable information on the location of pH sensors in HA. Importantly, the observed change in HA1-H38 conformation is further evidence that the pH-induced conformational changes of HA are the result of a series of protonation events to conserved and non-conserved pH sensors.

High-resolution structures of the DHDPS-lysine complex have revealed significant insights into the binding events. One key asparagine residue, N84, makes hydrogen bonds with both the carboxyl and the α-amino group of the bound lysine. We generated two mutants, N84A and N84D, to study the effects of these changes on the allosteric site properties. However, under normal assay conditions, N84A displayed notably lower catalytic activity, and N84D showed no activity.

Ribosome dimer formation strongly depends on the dimerization of the C-terminal domain of SaHPF (CTDSaHPF). In this study, we solved the crystal structure of CTDSaHPF at 1.6 Å resolution and obtained a precise arrangement of the dimer interface. Residues Phe160, Val162, Thr171, Ile173, Tyr175, Ile185 andThr187 in the dimer interface of SaHPF protein were mutated and the effects were analyzed for the formation of 100S disomes of ribosomes isolated from S. aureus.

A typical cell of the photosynthetic synurophyte Mallomonas is covered by about 60-100 silica scales. Their geometric arrangement, the so-called scale case, mainly depends on the species and on the cell cycle. In this study, the scale case of the photosynthetic synurophyte Mallomonas was preserved in aqueous suspension using high-pressure freezing (HPF). From this specimen, a three-dimensional (3D) data set spanning a volume of about 25.6μm × 19.2μm × 4.2μm with a voxel size of 12.5nm × 12.5nm × 25.0nm was collected by Cryo-FIB SEM in 3 hours and 24 minutes. SEM imaging using In-lens SE detection allowed to clearly differentiate between mineralized, curved scales of less than 0.2μm thickness and organic cellular ultrastructure or vitrified ice. The three-dimensional spatial orientations and shapes of a minimum set of scales (N=13) were identified by visual inspection, and manually segmented. Manual and automated segmentation approaches were comparatively applied to one arbitrarily selected reference scale using the differences in grey level between scales and other constituents. Computational automated routines and principal component analysis of the experimentally extracted data created a realistic mathematical model based on the Fibonacci pattern theory. A complete in-silico scale case of Mallomonas was reconstructed showing an optimized scale coverage on the cell surface, similarly as it was observed experimentally.

The assembly mode A11 is dependent on lateral tetramerization of the second coiled-coil segment (coil1b) in antiparallel fashion. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies pointed to 3.5 nm lamin filaments built from two antiparallel threads of longitudinally associated dimers but little molecular detail is available to date. Here we present the 2.6 Å resolution X-ray structure of a lamin A fragment including residues 65 to 222 which reveals the molecular basis of the A11 interaction. The crystal structure also indicates a continuous α-helical structure for the preceding linker L1 region. The middle part of the antiparallel tetramer reveals unique interactions due to the lamin-specific 42-residue insert in coil1b. At the same time, distinct characteristics of this insert provide for the preservation of common structural principles shared with lateral coil1b tetramers of vimentin and keratin K1/K10. In addition, structural analysis suggests that the A11 interaction in lamins is somewhat weaker than in cytoplasmic IFs, despite a 30% longer overlap. Establishing the structural detail of the A11 interaction across IF types is the first step towards a rational understanding of the IF assembly process which is indispensable for establishing the mechanism of disease-related mutations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Annexin A5 self-assembles into a two-dimensional (2D) array and prevents cell rupture by attaching to damaged membranes. However, this process is not fully understood at the molecular level. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of annexin A5 with and without calcium (Ca2+) and confirmed the Ca2+-dependent outward motion of a tryptophan residue. Strikingly, the two structures exhibited the same crystal packing and 2D arrangement into a p3 lattice, which agrees well with the results of low-resolution structural imaging. High-resolution structures indicated that a three-fold interaction near the tryptophan residue is important for mediating the formation of the p3 lattice. A hypothesis on the promotion of p3 lattice formation by phosphatidyl serine (PS) is also suggested.

Taking as examples the 1018 three-dimensional models produced during the GPCR Dock 2008, 2010 and 2013 competitions and 390 models for a GPCR target in CASP13, we show that this rule was not accounted for by the modeling community.

Several biologically important proteins interact with G-quadruplexes, of which RHAU - a helicase from the DEAH-box superfamily, was shown to bind and unwind G-quadruplexes efficiently. We report a X-ray co-crystal structure at 1.5 Å resolution of an N-terminal fragment of RHAU bound to the exposed tetrad of a parallel-stranded G-quadruplex. The RHAU peptide folds into an L-shaped α-helix, and binds to the G-quadruplex through π-stacking and electrostatic interactions.

However, its primary role is ribosome formation. Although the factors and mechanisms involved in ribogenesis are well conserved in eukaryotes, two types of nucleoli have been observed under the electron microscope: a tricompartmentalized nucleolus in amniotes and a bicompartmentalized nucleolus in other species. A recent study has also revealed that turtles, although belonging to amniotes, displayed a nucleolus with bipartite organization, suggesting that this reptile group may have carried out a reversion phenomenon during evolution. In this study, we examine in great detail the functional organization of the turtle nucleolus. In liver and spleen cells cultured in vitro, we confirm that the turtle nucleolus is mainly formed by two components: a fibrillar zone surrounded by a granular zone. We further show that the fibrillar zone includes densely-contrasted strands, which are positive after silver-stained Nucleolar Organizer Region (Ag-NOR) staining and DNA labelling. We also reveal that the dense strands condensed into a very compact mass within the fibrillar zone after a treatment with actinomycin D or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside. Finally, by using pulse-chase experiments with BrUTP, three-dimensional image reconstructions of confocal optical sections, and electron microscopy analysis of ultrathin sections, we show that the topological and spatial dynamics of rRNA within the nucleolus extend from upstream binding factor (UBF)-positive sites in the fibrillar zone to the granular zone, without ever releasing the positive sites for the UBF. Together, these results seem to clearly indicate that the compartmentalization of the turtle nucleolus into two main components reflects a less orderly organization of ribosome formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The reconstruction process leading to the final three-dimensional (3D) map is iterative and requires an initial volume to prime the refinement procedure. Particle images are aligned to this first reference and subsequently a new map is calculated from these particles. The accurate determination of an ab initio initial volume is still a challenging and open problem in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Different algorithms are available to estimate an initial volume from the dataset. Some of these methods provide multiple candidate initial maps and users looking for robustness typically run different approaches. In this case, users arbitrarily evaluate the different obtained candidate maps, as we lack robust methods to objectively assess the accuracy of initial references. This workflow is subjective and error-prone preventing implementation of high-throughput data processing procedures. In this work, we present a robust method to determine the best initial map or maps from a set of ab initio initial volumes obtained from one or multiple different approaches. The method is based on evaluating multiple small subsets of candidate initial volumes and particle images through reference-based 3D classifications. Obtained 3D classes of accurate initial maps will result majoritarian and the respective attracted particles will be aligned with high angular accuracies.

In this procedure, the changes of the beam tilt and the astigmatism against the beam shift are measured and calibrated. The beam tilt and the astigmatism are corrected by changing the setting of the microscope using predicted values from the calibration. Using our corrected beam-image shift data collection, we found that the resolution remained identical as long as the distance of the beam shift was below 10 μm.

It is a structure adopted by many neuropeptides and neurohormones during the formation of dense core vesicles in secretory cells, yet the mechanisms mediating assembly and disassembly of these amyloids remain unclear. Neurokinin B is a neuropeptide thought to form an amyloid in secretory cells. It is known to coordinate copper, but the physiological significance of metal binding is not known. In this work we explored the amyloid formation of neurokinin B and the impact that metals had on the aggregation behaviour. We show that the production of neurokinin B amyloid is dependent on the phosphate concentration, the pH and the presence of a histidine at position 3 in the primary sequence. Copper(II) and nickel(II) coordination to the peptide, which requires the histidine imidazole group, completely inhibits amyloid formation, whereas zinc(II) slows, but does not inhibit fibrillogenesis. Furthermore, we show that copper(II) can rapidly disassemble preformed neurokinin B amyloid.

In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of St- ω TA at 1.9 Å resolution to clarify in detail its mechanism of substrate recognition. The structure of St- ω TA revealed that it has a voluminous active site resulting from the unique spatial arrangement of residues comprising its active site. In addition, our molecular docking simulation results suggest that substrate compounds may bind to active site residues via electrostatic interactions or hydrophobic interactions that can be induced by subtle rearrangements of active site residues. On the basis of these structural analyses, we propose a plausible working model of the enzymatic mechanism of St- ω TA.

Three orthologs of EGCs, each with distinct substrate specificity, have been identified to date, including EGC-I, EGC-II, and EGALC. Although the structures of EGC-I and EGC-II have been reported, the substrate preference mechanism of EGC enzymes remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structure of EGALC from Rhodococcus hoagii 103S at a resolution of 1.20 Å. Distinct from EGC-I and EGC-II, which both have a tunnel-like substrate binding site, the structure of EGALC accommodates substrates in a long groove. Further, the oligosaccharide-binding region of groove could be divided into two small pockets that separately bind to the Gal1 and to the Gal3/Gla3 present in 6-gala series substrates. Structural and sequence comparisons of EGC enzymes revealed that the conformation and length of their Nβ8-Lα1 regions are crucial in determining the architectures of their specific substrate binding sites. Importantly, molecular docking analyses indicate that the substrate specificity of each EGC is mainly derived from the complementarity of its active site groove/tunnel with substrates adopting particular conformations.

Recently, these enzymes were identified in various non-pathogenic Bacillus species and subsequently in Clostridioides difficile, a major clinical pathogen associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Comparison of the BPU-1 enzyme from Bacillus pumilus with the CDD-1 and CDD-2 enzymes from C. difficile demonstrated that the latter enzymes have broadened their substrate profile to efficiently hydrolyze the expanded-spectrum methoxyimino cephalosporins, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. These two antibiotics are major contributors to the development of C. difficile infection, as they suppress sensitive bacterial microflora in the gut but fail to kill the pathogen which is highly resistant to these drugs. To gain insight into the structural features that contribute to the expansion of the substrate profile of CDD enzymes compared to BPU-1, we solved the crystal structures of CDD-1 and its complex with cefotaxime. Comparison of CDD-1 structures with those of class D enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria showed that in the cefotaxime-CDD-1 complex, the antibiotic is bound in a substantially different mode due to structural differences in the enzyme's active sites. We also found that CDD-1 has a uniquely long Ω-loop when compared to all other class D β-lactamases.

Driven by an N-terminal α/β-hydrolase-folded domain with a protruding interaction helix, EDS1 assembles with two homologs, phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4) and senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101). The resulting heterodimers are critical for EDS1 function and structurally well characterized. Here, we resolve solution and crystal structures of unbound Arabidopsis thaliana EDS1 (AtEDS1) using nanobodies for crystallization. These structures, together with gel filtration and immunoprecipitation data, show that PAD4/SAG101-unbound AtEDS1 is stable as a monomer and does not form the homodimers recorded in public databases. Its PAD4/SAG101 anchoring helix is disordered unless engaged in protein/protein interactions. As in the complex with SAG101, monomeric AtEDS1 has a substrate-inaccessible esterase triad with a blocked oxyanion hole and without space for a covalent acyl intermediate. These new structures suggest that the AtEDS1 monomer represents an inactive or pre-activated ground state.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These so called cryo-lamellae allow high-resolution structural studies of the natural cellular environment by in situ cryo-electron tomography. However, the cryo-lamella workflow is a low-throughput technique and can easily be hindered by technical issues like the bending of the lamellae during the final cryo-FIB-milling steps. The severity of lamella bending seems to correlate with crinkling of the EM grid support film at cryogenic temperatures, which could generate tensions that may be transferred onto the thin lamella, leading to its bending and breakage. To protect the lamellae from such forces, we milled ""micro-expansion joints"" alongside the lamellae, creating gaps in the support that can act as physical buffers to safely absorb material motion. We demonstrate that the presence of micro-expansion joints drastically decreases bending of lamellae milled from eukaryotic cells grown and frozen on EM grids. Furthermore, we show that this adaptation does not create additional instabilities that could impede subsequent parts of the cryo-lamella workflow, as we obtained high-quality Volta phase plate tomograms revealing macromolecules in their natural structural context. The minimal additional effort required to implement micro-expansion joints in the cryo-FIB-milling workflow makes them a straightforward solution against cryo-lamella bending to increase the throughput of in situ structural biology studies.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Multiple crystal structures of the NG domain of E. coli FtsYNG have been determined at high-resolution (1.22 to 1.88 Å), in the nucleotide-free (apo) form as well as bound to GDP and non-hydrolysable GTP analogues. The combination of high-resolution and multiple solved structures of FtsYNG in different states revealed a new sensor-relay system of this unique GTPase receptor. A nucleotide sensing function of the P-loop assists FtsYNG in nucleotide-binding and contributes to modulate nucleotide binding properties in SRP GTPases. A reorganization of the other G-loops and the insertion binding domain (IBD) is observed only upon transition from a diphosphate to a triphosphate nucleotide. The role of a magnesium ion during the GDP and GTP-bound states has also been observed. The binding of magnesium in the nucleotide site causes the reorientation of the β- and γ- phosphate groups toward the jaws of the P-loop and stabilizes the binding of the nucleotide, creating a network of hydrogen and water-bridge interactions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In general, glutathionylation occurs under the condition of elevated oxidative stress in vivo. In human hemoglobin, Cys93 residue of β globin chain was found to undergo this oxidative modification. Glutathionyl hemoglobin (GSHb) was reported to act as a biomarker of oxidative stress under several clinical conditions such as chronic renal failure, iron deficiency anemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, Friedreich's ataxia, atherosclerosis. Previously we showed that the functional abnormality associated with six-fold tighter oxygen binding of GSHb supposedly attributed to the conformational transition of the deoxy state of GSHb towards oxy hemoglobin like conformation. In the present study, we investigated the structural integrity and overall architecture of the quaternary structure of GSHb using native mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry platforms. The dissociation equilibrium constants of both tetramer/dimer (Kd1) and dimer/monomer equilibrium (Kd2) was observed to increase by 1.91 folds and 3.64 folds respectively.

While many studies have been performed on adult SMPs, those of larval stages remain largely undescribed. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the larval shell proteome of the blue mussel for the first time and to compare it to adult mussel shell proteomes. Following development of a method for cleaning larval shells of tissue contaminants, 49 SMPs were identified using shotgun proteomics. Twenty-one proteins were independently identified in all samples indicating that they form a subset of the core larval shell proteome. These included: the blue mussel shell protein, a peroxidase domain-containing sequence, a laminin G domain-containing sequence, a ZIP domain-containing sequence and a ferric-chelate reductase 1-like sequence. Additional SMP domains identified were: fibronectin type III, BPTI/Kunitz, chitin-binding type 3, thyroglobulin and EF-hand. While key predictable molluscan shell matrix functions are identified, 67% of sequences remain unknown or uncharacterized, indicating that this shell proteome is unique to mussel larvae. Specifically, comparison with adult mytilids reveals that 9 domains are exclusive to the larval shell proteome and only 4 domains are conserved among species and developmental stages.

Previous studies have shown that MR recognizes multiple ligands and recycles between cell surface and endosomes, and the conformation and ligand binding of MR are regulated by environmental pH. However, due to the lack of high-resolution details, the mechanisms of the pH-dependent properties of MR have not been fully been understood. Here we investigate the pH-dependent conformational change of MR by solving a series of crystal structures of MR N-terminal fragments (CysR∼CTLD2/3) at pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.5. The results show that the CTLD3 domain plays a critical role in regulating the conformational change of the N-terminal region of MR by forming interactions with the CTLD2 domain specifically at acidic pH. Moreover, the structural data also show the conformational changes of the 4-SO4-GalNAc binding pocket at the CysR domain, which might be relevant to the binding and release of the ligand. Overall, these results provide a model for the pH-dependent conformational change of the N-terminal region of MR that may help to understand its functional mechanism at molecular level.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

UBTF plays a role in rDNA bending and its maintenance in ""open"" state. It exists as two splicing variants, UBTF1 and UBTF2, which cannot be discerned with antibodies raised against UBTF. We investigated the ultrastructural localization of each variant in cells synthesizing GFP-tagged UBTF1 or UBTF2 by using anti-GFP antibodies and pre-embedding nanogold strategy. Detailed 3D distribution of UBTF1 and 2 was also studied by electron tomography. In control cells, the two isoforms are very abundant within fibrillar centers, but their repartition strongly differs. Electron tomography shows that UBTF1 is disposed as fibrils that are folded in coils whereas UBTF2 is localized homogenously, preferentially at their cortical area. As UBTF is a useful marker to trace rDNA genes, we used these data to improve our previous model of 3D organization of active transcribing rDNA gene within fibrillar centers. Finally, when rRNA synthesis is inhibited during actinomycin D treatment or entry in mitosis, UBTF1 and UBTF2 show a similar distribution along extended 3D loop-like structures. Altogether these data suggest new roles for UBTF1 and UBTF2 isoforms in the organization of active and inactive rDNA genes.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In this work, we employ two phosphonate analogues of 2-oxoglutarate (OG), i.e. succinyl phosphonate (SP) and phosphono ethyl succinyl phosphonate (PESP), as tools to isolate the first catalytic steps and understand the significance of conformational transitions for the enzyme regulation. The kinetics showed a more efficient inhibition of mycobacterial E1o by SP (Ki 0.043 ± 0.013 mM) than PESP (Ki 0.88 ± 0.28 mM), consistent with the different circular dichroism spectra of the corresponding complexes. PESP allowed us to get crystallographic snapshots of the Michaelis-like complex, the first one for 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases, followed by the covalent adduction of the inhibitor to ThDP, mimicking the pre-decarboxylation complex. In addition, covalent ThDP-phosphonate complexes obtained with both compounds by co-crystallization were in the late conformational state, probably corresponding to slowly dissociating enzyme-inhibitor complexes. We discuss the relevance of these findings in terms of regulatory features of the mycobacterial E1o enzymes, and in the perspective of developing tools for species-specific metabolic regulation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

TTR stabilizers are able to interact with the thyroxine-binding sites of TTR, stabilizing its tetrameric native state and inhibiting amyloidogenesis. Herein, we report on in vitro, ex vivo and X-ray analyses to assess the TTR structural stabilization by analogues of flurbiprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Overall, considering together binding selectivity and protective effects on TTR native structure by flurbiprofen analogues in the presence of plasma proteins, as determined by Western Blot,the aforementioned properties of analyzed compounds appear to be better (CHF5075 and CHF4802) or similar (CHF4795) or worse (CHF5074, also known as CSP-1103) as compared to those of diflunisal, used as a reference TTR stabilizer. Molecular details of the determinants affecting the interactionsof CHF5075, CHF4802 and CHF4795 with wild type TTRand of CHF5074 withtheamyloidogenic A25TTTR variant havebeen elucidated by X-ray analysis. Distinct interactions with TTR appear to characterize flurbiprofen analogues and the NSAID diflunisal and its analogues as TTR stabilizers.

However, visualization of individual chromatids in living cells and quantification of their geometry, remains technically challenging. Here, we used live cell imaging to quantitate the three-dimensional conformation of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal DNA (rDNA). rDNA is confined within the nucleolus and is composed of about 200 copies representing about 10% of the yeast genome. To fluorescently label rDNA in living cells, we generated a set of nucleolar proteins fused to GFP or made use of a tagged rDNA, in which lacO repetitions were inserted in each repeat unit. We could show that nucleolus is not modified in appearance, shape or size during interphase while rDNA is highly reorganized. Computationally tracing 3D rDNA paths allowed us to quantitatively assess rDNA size, shape and geometry. During interphase, rDNA was progressively reorganized from a zig-zag segmented line of small size (5,5 micrometer) to a long, homogeneous, line-like structure of 8,7 micrometer in metaphase. Most importantly, whatever the cell-cycle stage considered, rDNA fibre could be decomposed in subdomains, as previously suggested for 3D chromatin organisation. Finally, we could determine that spatial reorganisation of these subdomains and establishment of rDNA mitotic organisation is under the control of the cohesin complex.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The process involves a nucleophilic attack on PLP by an active site Lys residue, followed by proton transfers resulting in a carbinolamine (CBA) intermediate that undergoes dehydration to form the aldimine. Despite a general understanding of the pathway, the structural basis of the mechanistic roles of specific residues in each of these steps is unclear. Here we determined the crystal structure of the LLP form (holo-form) of a Group II PLP-dependent decarboxylase from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjDC) at 1.7 Å resolution. By comparing the crystal structure of MjDC in the LLP form with that of the pyridoxal-P (non-covalently bound aldehyde) form, we demonstrate structural evidence for a water-mediated mechanism of LLP formation. A conserved extended hydrogen-bonding network around PLP coupled to the pyridinyl nitrogen influences activation and catalysis by affecting the electronic configuration of PLP. Furthermore, the two cofactor bound forms revealed open and closed conformations of the catalytic loop (CL) in the absence of a ligand, supporting a hypothesis for a regulatory link between LLP formation and CL dynamics. The evidence suggests that activation of Group II decarboxylases involves a complex interplay of interactions between the electronic states of PLP, the active site micro-environment and CL dynamics.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These organisms produce highly complex mineralized scales that are composed of hierarchical assemblies of nano-crystals of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. Coccolith formation in vivo occurs within compartmentalized mineralisation vesicles derived from the Golgi body, which contain coccolith-associated polysaccharides ('CAPs') providing polymorph selection and mediating crystal growth kinetics, and oval organic mineralisation templates, also known as base plates, which promote heterogenous nucleation and further mechanical interlocking of calcite single crystals. Although the function of coccolith base plates in controlling crystal nucleation have been widely studied, their 3D spatial organization and the chemical functional groups present on the crystal nucleation sites, which are two crucial features impacting biomineralization, remain unsolved. Utilising cryo-electron tomography we show that base plates derived from an exemplary coccolithophore Pleurochrysis carterae (Pcar) in their native hydrated state have a complex 3-layered structure. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the edge and rim of the base plate - where the crystals nucleate - are rich in primary amine functionalities that provide binding targets for negatively charged complexes composed of synthetic macromolecules and Ca2+ ions.

In this paper, a virtual segmentation technique is proposed to optimize Delaunay triangulation. Based on the optimized Delaunay triangulation, an Optimized Distance Weighted Tessellation (ODWT) algorithm is developed. Two different structures, namely carrot and retting maize vascular bundles, were reconstructed via the ODWT algorithm. The accuracy of ODWT is evaluated statistically by comparing with Centroid-based Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) and Area Weighted Tessellation (AWT). The results show that ODWT has distinct advantages over CVT and AWT. It is worth mentioning that ODWT has better performance than CVT when there exists large diversity in adjacent cell area. It is found that CVT and AWT fail to reconstruct cells with elongated and concave shapes, while ODWT shows excellent feasibility and reliability. Furthermore, ODWT is capable of establishing finite tissue boundary, which CVT and AWT have failed to realize. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm with higher accuracy to implement the preprocessing for further numerical study of plants properties.

The essential residue for this mechanism is the very first glycine that is conserved among almost all picornaviruses. However, kobuviruses and siciniviruses have a serine residue instead. Intrigued by this anomaly we sought to solve the crystal structure of these 3Dpol enzymes. The structures revealed a unique fold of the 3Dpol N-termini but the very first serine residues were inserted into a charged pocket in a similar manner as the glycine residue in other picornaviruses.

The rules that define secondary structure elements do not apply when the distribution of amino acids becomes biased. While there is a tendency towards structural disorder in LCRs, various examples, and particularly homorepeats of single amino acids, suggest that very short repeats could adopt structures very difficult to predict. These structures are possibly variable and dependant on the context of intra- or inter-molecular interactions. In general, short repeats in LCRs can induce structure. This could explain the observation that very short (non-perfect) repeats are widespread and many define regions with a function in protein interactions. For these reasons, we have developed an algorithm to quickly analyze local repeatability along protein sequences, that is, how close a protein fragment is from a perfect repeat. Using this algorithm we identified that the proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are depleted in short repeats (approximate or not) of odd-length, while the human proteins are not, that the fish Danio rerio has many proteins with repeats of length two and that the plant Arabidopsis thaliana has an unusually large amount of repeats of length seven.

The majority of filamentous ascomycetes possess multiple β -CA isoforms among which major and minor forms have been characterized. We examined the catalytic behavior of the two minor β -CAs, CafC and CafD, of Aspergillus fumigatus, and found that both enzymes exhibited low CO2 hydration activities. To understand the structural basis of their low activities, we performed X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Both enzymes exist as homodimers. Like other Type-I β -CAs, the CafC active site has an ""open"" conformation in which the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by three residues (C36, H88 and C91) and a water molecule. However, L25 and L78 on the rim of the catalytic entry site protrude into the active site cleft, partially occluding access to it. Single (L25G or L78G) and double mutants provided evidence that widening the entrance to the active site greatly accelerates catalytic activity. By contrast, CafD has a typical Type-II ""closed"" conformation in which the zinc-bound water molecule is replaced by aspartic acid (D36). The most likely explanation for this result is that an arginine that is largely conserved within the β -CA family is replaced by glycine (G38), so that D36 cannot undergo a conformational change by forming a D-R pair that creates the space for a zinc-bound water molecule and switches the enzyme to the active form. The CafD structure also reveals the presence of a ''non-catalytic'' zinc ion in the dimer interface, which may contribute to stabilizing the dimeric assembly.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Typically, these enzymes exist in three-domain [N-terminal domain (N-domain), catalytic domain, and C-terminal domain (C-domain)] or four-domain (N-domain, catalytic domain, middle domain, and C-domain) format in which N-domain and catalytic domain are more conserved. The C-domain plays important roles in substrate binding and gating. In this study we report the first structure of a two-domain (N-domain and catalytic domain) M1 peptidase at 2.05 Å resolution. Despite the lack of C-domain, the enzyme is active and prefers peptide substrates with large hydrophobic N-terminal residues. Its substrate-bound structure was determined at 1.9 Å resolution. Structural analyses supported by site directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal structural features that could compensate for the lack of C-domain. A unique loop insertion (loop A) in the N-domain has important roles in gating and desolvation of active site. Three Arg residues of the catalytic domain are involved in substrate-binding roles typically played by positively charged residues of C-domain in other M1 peptidases. Further, its unique exopeptidase sequence motif, LALET, creates a more hydrophobic environment at the S1 subsite (which binds N-terminal residue of the substrate in aminopeptidases) than the more common GXMEN motif in the family. This leads to high affinity for large hydrophobic residues in the S1 subsite, which contributes towards efficient substrate binding in absence of C-domain.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we investigated the StI topology in membranes by site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results reveal that StI in membrane exhibits an oligomeric architecture with heterogeneous stoichiometry of predominantly eight or nine protomers, according to the available structural models. The StI topology resembles the conic pore structure reported for the actinoporin fragaceatoxin C. Our data show that StI coexists in two membrane-associated conformations, with the N-terminal segment either attached to the protein core or inserted in the membrane forming the pore.

These challenging multi-protein targets are typically susceptible to dissociation and/or denaturation upon cryo-EM grid preparation, and often require crosslinking prior to freezing. Several approaches for gentle on-column or in-tube crosslinking have been developed. On-column crosslinking is not widely applicable because of the poor separation properties of gel filtration techniques. In-tube crosslinking frequently causes sample aggregation and/or precipitation. Gradient-based crosslinking through the GraFix method is more robust, but very time-consuming and necessitates specialised expensive equipment. Furthermore, removal of the glycerol typically involves significant sample loss and may cause destabilization detrimental to the sample quality. Here, we introduce an alternative procedure: AgarFix (Agarose Fixation). The sample is embedded in an agarose matrix that keeps the molecules separated, thus preventing formation of aggregates upon cross-inking. Gentle crosslinking is accomplished by diffusion of the cross-linker into the agarose drop. The sample is recovered by diffusion or electroelution and can readily be used for cryo-EM specimen preparation. AgarFix requires minimal equipment and basic lab experience, making it widely accessible to the cryo-EM community.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

VEK50 contains the full A-domain of PAM, which is responsible for its low nanomolar binding to hPg. The interaction of VEK50 with kringle 2, the PAM-binding domain in hPg (K2hPg), has been studied by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The data show that each VEK50 monomer in solution contains two tight binding sites for K2hPg, one each in the a1- (RH1; R17H18) and a2- (RH2; R30H31) repeats within the A-domain of VEK50. Two mutant forms of VEK50, viz., VEK50[RH1/AA] (VEK50ΔRH1) and VEK50[RH2/AA] (VEK50ΔRH2), were designed by replacing each RH with AA, thus eliminating one of the K2hPg binding sites within VEK50, and allowing separate study of each binding site. Using 13C- and 15N-labeled peptides, NMR-derived solution structures of VEK50 in its complex with K2hPg were solved. We conclude that the A-domain of PAM can accommodate two molecules of K2hPg docked within a short distance of each other, and the strength of the binding is slightly different for each site.

In this work, we examine the accuracy of structural representation resulting from application of a number of explicit and implicit solvent models and refinement protocols against experimental data ranging from high density of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints to completely unrestrained simulations. For a prototype A-form RNA helix, our results indicate that AMBER RNA force field with either implicit or explicit solvent can produce a realistic dynamic representation of RNA helical structure, accurately cross-validating with respect to a diverse array of NMR observables. In refinement against NMR distance restraints, modern MD force fields are found to be equally adequate, with high fidelity cross-validation to the residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs), while slightly over-estimating structural order as monitored via NMR relaxation data. With restraints trimmed to encode only for base pairing information, cross-validation quality significantly deteriorates, now exhibiting a pronounced dependence on the choice of the solvent model. This deterioration is found to be partially reversible by increasing planarity restraints on the nucleobase geometry. For completely unrestrained MD simulations, the choice of water model becomes very important, with the best-performing TIP4P-Ew accurately reproducing both the RDC and RCSA data, while closely matching the NMR-derived order parameters.

Polysaccharide lyase family 2 (PL2) is divided into two major subfamilies that are broadly-associated with contrasting 'endolytic' (PL2A) or 'exolytic' (PL2B) activities on HG. In the Y. enterocolitica genome, the PL2A gene is adjacent to an independent carbohydrate binding module from family 32 (YeCBM32), which possesses a N-terminal secretion tag and is known to specifically bind HG. Independent CBMs are rare in nature and, most commonly, are fused to enzymes in order to potentiate catalysis. The unconventional gene architecture of YePL2A and YeCBM32, therefore, may represent an ancestral relic of a fission event that decoupled PL2A from its cognate CBM. To provide further insight into the evolution of this pectinolytic locus and the molecular basis of HG depolymerisation within Y. enterocolitica, we have resurrected a YePL2A-YeCBM32 chimera and demonstrated that the extant PL2A digests HG more efficiently. In addition, we have engineered a tryptophan from the active site of the exolytic YePL2B into YePL2A (YePL2A-K291W) and demonstrated, using X-ray crystallography of substrate complexes, that it is a structural determinant of exo-activity within the PL2 family.

During sample preparation, macromolecules interact with the air-water interface, which often leads to detrimental effects such as denaturation or adoption of preferred orientations, ultimately hindering structure determination. Randomly biotinylating the protein of interest (for example, at its primary amines) and then tethering it to a cryo-EM grid coated with two-dimensional crystals of streptavidin (acting as an affinity surface) can prevent the protein from interacting with the air-water interface. Recently, this approach was successfully used to solve a high-resolution structure of a test sample, a bacterial ribosome. However, whether this method can be used for samples where interaction with the air-water interface has been shown to be problematic remains to be determined.

Structural analysis of the closed active site conformation, stabilized by the binding of 3 Mg2+ ions, inorganic pyrophosphate, and the benzyltriethylammonium cation, reveals a product-like active site contour that serves as the cyclization template. Remolding the active site contour to resemble curcumene instead of epi-isozizaene is the principal determinant of the reprogrammed cyclization cascade. Intriguingly, an ordered water molecule comprises part of the active site contour. This water molecule may also serve as a final proton acceptor, along with inorganic pyrophosphate, in the generation of curcumene regioisomers; it may also contribute to the formation of sesquiterpene alcohols identified as minor side products. Thus, the substitution of polar side chains for nonpolar side chains in terpenoid cyclase active sites can result in the stabilization of bound water molecules that, in turn, can serve template functions in isoprenoid cyclization reactions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we report two crystal structures of ArsR repressors from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (AfArsR) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgArsR) in the As(III)-bound form. AfArsR crystallized in P21 space group and diffracted up to 1.86 Å. CgArsR crystallized in P212121 and diffracted up to 1.6 Å. AfArsR showed one As(III) bound in one subunit of the homodimer, while the CgArsR structure showed two As(III) bound with S3 coordination, one in each monomer. Previous studies indicated that in AfArsR As(III) binds to Cys95, Cys96 and Cys102 from the same monomer, while, in CgArsR, to Cys15, Cys16 from one monomer and Cys55 from the other monomer. The dimer interfaces of these structures showed distinct differences from other members of the ArsR/SmtB family of proteins, which potentially renders multiple options for evolving metal(loid) binding sites in this family of proteins. Also, CgArsR presents a new α2-N binding site, not the previously predicted α3-N site. Despite differences in the location of the binding cysteines in the primary sequences of these proteins, the two metal binding sites are almost congruent on their structures, an example of convergent evolution. Analyses of the electrostatic surface of the proteins at the DNA binding domain indicate that there two different modes of derepression in the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended δ subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial α3:β3:γ:ε-domain and c subunit ring were resolved. Here, we report the first purification protocol of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase including the F1-domain, the entire membrane-embedded FO sector, and the stator subunits b' and the fused b-δ. This enzyme purification enabled the determination of the first projected 2D- and 3D structure of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase by electron microscopy (EM) and single particle analysis. Expression and purification of the fused mycobacterial b-δ24-446 construct, excluding the membrane-embedded N-terminal amino acids, provided insight into its secondary structure. By combining these data with homology and ab-initio modeling techniques, a model of the mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunits b-δ and b' was generated. Superposition of the 3D M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase EM-structure, the α3:β3:γ:ε and c-ring, and the derived structural models of the peripheral stalk enabled a clear assignment of all F-ATP synthase subunits, in particular with respect to the unique mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunit b' and the elongated δ fused with subunit b.

The interactions made by each residue are the basis for sidechain (rotamer) conformation and ultimately for secondary, tertiary and even quaternary protein structure. By identifying and characterizing the interactions for each residue type, we are developing a basis set of environmental data that can be used to understand protein structure. This work focuses alanine and its roles. We calculated and analyzed separately backbone-to-environment and sidechain-to-environment 3D maps for over 57,000 alanines that, with respect to hydrophobic and polar interactions, show the environment around each. After binning by backbone ϕ and ψ angles, we clustered each bin with k-means based on calculated map similarities between map-map pairs. Four bins were examined in detail: one in the β-pleat region, two in the right-hand α-helix (RHα) region and one in the left-hand α-helix region of the Ramachandran plot. All regions indicated a common map motif of hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions along the CA-CB axis, accounting for 62% in the β-pleat bin, about one-third in the two RHα bins and 42% in the LHα bin. Another shared motif shows no interactions along the CA-CB axis; this was uncommon (8%) in β-pleat, but >30% elsewhere. The maps calculated for the two RHα bins are extremely similar (pairwise >0.9787), which suggests that the hydropathic interaction sets or motifs found around each residue are conserved. Altogether, these results are integral to a new paradigm for understanding protein structure and function.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we show that these issues can be addressed concurrently, using the serpin human α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) as a model. We have introduced up to 15 amino acid substitutions into ACT, converting it into a surrogate corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), thereby creating a new binding globulin (NewBG). Human CBG and ACT share 46% sequence identity, and CBG served as the blue-print for our design, which was guided by side-chain-packing calculations, ITC measurements and crystal structure determinations. Upon transfer of ligand-interacting residues from CBG to ACT and mutation of specific second shell residues, a NewBG variant was obtained, which binds cortisol with 1.5 µM affinity. This novel serpin (NewBG-III) binds cortisol with a 33-fold lower affinity than CBG, but shares a similar ligand-binding profile and binding mode when probed with different steroid ligands and site-directed mutagenesis. An additional substitution, i.e. A349R, created NewBG-III-allo, which introduced an allosteric coupling between ligand binding and the serpin-like S-to-R transition in ACT. In NewBG-III-allo, the proteinase-triggered S-to-R transition leads to a greater than 200-fold reduction in ligand affinity, and crystal structures suggest that this is mediated by the L55V and A349R substitutions. This reduction significantly exceeds the 10-fold reduction in binding affinity observed in human CBG.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

It has been shown that the wall teichoic acid (WTA) may be an important drug target acting on antibiotic-resistant cells. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, MnaA, is one of the first enzymes on the pathway for the biosynthesis of the WTA. Here, detailed molecular dynamics simulations of S. aureus MnaA were used to characterize the conformational changes that occur in the presence of UDP and UDP-GlcNac and also the energetic landscape associated with these changes. Using different simulation techniques, such as ABMD and GAMD, it was possible to assess the energetic profile for the protein with and without ligands in its active site. We found that there is a dynamic energy landscape that has its minimum changed by the presence of the ligands, with a closed structure of the enzyme being more frequently observed for the bound state while the unbound enzyme favors an opened conformation. Further structural analysis indicated that positively charged amino acids associated with UDP and UDP-GlcNac interactions play a major role in the enzyme opening movement. Finally, the energy landscape profiled in this work provides important conclusions for the design of inhibitor candidates targeting S. aureus MnaA.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Imaging was carried out on Magellania venosa shells embedded/etched, chemically fixed/decalcified and high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples from the commissure, central shell portions and from puncta. Imaging results are complemented with morphometric evaluations of volume fractions of membrane-bound organelles. At the commissure the OME consists of several layers of cells. These cells form oblique extensions that, in cross-section, are round below the primary layer and flat underneath fibres. At the commissure the OME is multi-cell layered, in central shell regions it is single-cell layered. When actively secreting shell carbonate extrapallial space is lacking, because OME cells are in direct contact with the calcite of the forming fibres. Upon termination of secretion, OME cells attach via apical hemidesmosomes to extracellular matrix membranes that line the proximal surface of fibres. At the commissure volume fractions for vesicles, mitochondria and lysosomes are higher relative to single-cell layered regions, whereas for endoplasmic-reticulum and Golgi apparatus there is no difference. FE-SEM, TEM imaging reveals the lack of extrapallial space between OME cells and developing fibres. In addition, there is no indication for an amorphous precursor within fibres when these are in active secretion mode. Accordingly, our results do not support transport of minerals by vesicles from cells to sites of mineralization, rather by transfer of carbonate ions via transport mechanisms associated with OME cell membranes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this work, boosted by the recently determined atomic structure of the whole HIV-1 capsid and our understanding of its dynamics, we carry out a computational structure-based study of the mechanism of nucleotide import by HIV-1 capsid. Our analysis reveals a number of novel insights into the mechanism. Specifically, our structure analysis indicates that arginine 18 side chains use a bind-translocate-release mechanism to bind and guide the long nucleotide to pass through the arginine ring before releasing it into the capsid. We discover that LYS 25 plays a critical role in defining the directionality of the transport, in facilitating the disassociation of nucleotides from the arginine ring, and in relaying them further into the interior of the capsid. We predict that mutations of LYS 25 to other residues, assuming that they still result in viable viruses, should reverse the directionality of the transport and significantly lower the infectivity.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Insights into the substrate specificity for xylulose 5-phosphate.,"Phosphoketolases (PK) are TPP-dependent enzymes which play essential roles in carbohydrate metabolism of numerous bacteria. Depending on the substrate specificity PKs can be subdivided into xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) specific PKs (XPKs) and PKs which accept both X5P and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) (XFPKs). Despite their key metabolic importance, so far only the crystal structures of two XFPKs have been reported. There are no reported structures for any XPKs and for any complexes between PK and substrate. One of the major unknowns concerning PKs mechanism of action is related to the structural determinants of PKs substrate specificity for X5P or F6P. We report here the crystal structure of XPK from Lactococcus lactis (XPK-Ll) at 2.1 Å resolution. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) we proved that XPK-Ll is a dimer in solution. Towards better understanding of PKs substrate specificity, we performed flexible docking of TPP-X5P and TPP-F6P on crystal structures of XPK-Ll, two XFPKs and transketolase (TK). Calculated structure-based binding energies consistently support XPK-Ll preference for X5P. Analysis of structural models thus obtained show that substrates adopt moderately different conformation in PKs active sites following distinct networks of polar interactions. Based on the here reported structure of XPK-Ll we propose the most probable amino acid residues involved in the catalytic steps of reaction mechanism. Altogether our results suggest that PKs substrate preference for X5P or F6P is the outcome of a fine balance between specific binding network and dissimilar catalytic residues depending on the enzyme (XPK or XFPK) - substrate (X5P or F6P) couples.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Remarkably, SpaE contains an atypically lengthy unstructured C-terminal tail, along with an YPKN pilin motif peptide, which is normally reserved for backbone subunits.

As a step towards understanding the molecular basis of filament assembly, here we present two high-resolution structures of the SEPT7 GTPase domain complexed with GDP. One of these reveals a previously unreported coordination for the magnesium ion involving four water molecules and only a tenuous connection to the protein.

While the morphology of osteosarcoma has been well studied, there is virtually no information about the nanostructure of the tumour and changes in mineralization on the nanoscale level. In the present paper, human bone tissue inside, next to and remote from a sclerosing osteosarcoma was studied with small angle x-ray scattering, x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Quantitative evaluation of nanostructure parameters was combined with high resolution, large area mapping to obtain microscopic images with nanostructure parameter contrast. It was found that the tumour regions were characterized by a notable reduction in mineral particle size, while the mineral content was even higher than that in normal bone. Furthermore, the normal preferential orientation of mineral particles along the longitudinal direction of corticalis or trabeculae was largely suppressed.

They are synthesized through two consecutive reactions catalyzed by class II and I diterpene synthases (DTSs). The structural complexity of LRDs mainly depends on the catalytic activity of class I DTSs, which catalyze the formation of bicyclic to pentacyclic LRDs, using as a substrate the catalytic product of class II DTSs. To date, the structural and mechanistic details for the biosynthesis of bicyclic LRDs skeletons catalyzed by class I DTSs remain unclear. This work presents the first X-ray crystal structure of an (E)-biformene synthase, LrdC, from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain K155. LrdC was identified as a part of an LRD cluster of five genes and was found to be a class I DTS that catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent synthesis of bicyclic LRD (E)-biformene by the dephosphorylation and rearrangement of normal copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP). Structural analysis of LrdC coupled with docking studies suggests that Phe189 prevents cyclization beyond the bicyclic LRD product through a strong stabilization of the allylic carbocation intermediate, while Tyr317 functions as a general base catalyst to deprotonate the CPP substrate. Structural comparisons of LrdC with homology models of bacterial bicyclic LRD-forming enzymes (CldD, RmnD and SclSS), as well as with the crystallographic structure of bacterial tetracyclic LRD ent-kaurene synthase (BjKS), provide further structural insights into the biosynthesis of bacterial LRD natural products.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Considerable effort has gone into sequencing the tuatara genome and while this is not yet complete, there are now sufficient sequence data for conclusions to be drawn on the similarity of the β-keratins from the tuatara to those of other members of the sauropsids. These results, together with a comparison of the X-ray diffraction pattern of tuatara claw with those from seagull feather and goanna claw, confirm that there is a common structural plan in the β-keratins of all of the sauropsids, and not just those that comprise the archosaurs (birds and crocodiles), the testudines (turtles) and the squamates (lizards and snakes).",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The KIFs can be helically arranged around the macrofibril central axis, making a cylinder within which KIF helical angle relative to macrofibril axis increases approximately linearly from macrofibril centre to edge. Mesophase-based self-assembly has been implicated in the early formation of macrofibrils, which first appear as liquid-crystal tactoids in the bulb of hair follicles. Formation appears to be driven initially by interactions between pre-keratinized KIFs. Differences in the nature of these KIF-KIF interactions could result in all macrofibrils being internally twisted in a single handedness, or a 50:50 mixture of handedness within each cortical cell. We data-mined 41 electron tomograms containing three-dimensional macrofibril data from previously published studies of hair and wool. In all 644 macrofibrils examined we found that within each tomogram all macrofibrils had the same handedness. We concluded that earlier reports of left- and right-handed macrofibrils were due to artefacts of imaging or data processing. A handedness marker was used to confirm (using re-imaged sections from earlier studies) that, in both human and sheep, all macrofibrils are left-handed around the macrofibril axis. We conclude that this state is universal within mammalian hair. This also supports the conclusion that the origin of macrofibril twist is the expression of chiral twisting forces between adjacent KIFs, rather than mesophase splay and bending forces relaxing to twisting forces acting within a confined space.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

All together, these data revealed that MBOAT7 is a multispanning transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. Based on our model, the predicted catalytic dyad of the protein, composed of the conserved asparagine in position 321 (Asn-321) and the preserved histidine in position 356 (His-356), has a lumenal localization. These data are compatible with the role of MBOAT7 in remodeling the acyl chain composition of endomembranes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In human, its mutations lead to severe cognitive impairment known as the Renpenning syndrome, a form of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Here, we report a combined biophysical study of two PQBP-1 frameshift mutants, K192Sfs*7 and R153Sfs*41. Both mutants are dimeric in solution, in contrast to the monomeric wild-type protein. These mutants contain more folded contents and have increased thermal stabilities. Using small-angle X-ray scattering data, we generated three-dimensional envelopes which revealed their overall flat shapes. We also described each mutant using an ensemble model based on a native-like initial pool with a dimeric structural core. PQBP-1 is known to repress transcription by way of interacting with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which consists of 52 repeats of a consensus heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS.

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data from hydrated samples were used in this study to investigate the distribution of water in hair, and model the structure of the IF assembly. A main diffraction peak at a d-spacing of ∼90 Å, and two weaker reflections show that IFs are arranged in a ∼105 Å quasi-hexagonal lattice. Changes in the diffraction peaks show that only a small fraction of the water absorbed by hair enters between the IFs, and little water diffuses into the core of the IFs. The amount of water in the IF assembly increases rapidly up to 10% relative humidity (RH), and then slowly with further increase in RH. Most of the water appears to reside outside the IF assembly, in the voids and at the interfaces, and contribute to the central diffuse scattering. The IF assembly in the decuticled hair absorbs more water and is more ordered than that the native hair. This suggests that cuticle acts as a barrier, and might constrain the structure by compressing the cortex radially. Treatments with oils that are hydrophobic, heat treatment, and reduction of the S-S linkages that opens up the matrix by disulfide bond cleavage, all affect structure and water permeability. Coconut oil was found to impede hydration more than the soybean oil because of its ability to penetrate deeper into hair. A new model for the IF assembly that is sterically more favorable than the previous models is proposed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It plays a crucial role in the regulation of the carbon flow into the shikimate pathway. Until now, the crystal structures and regulatory mechanisms of dimeric DAHPS enzymes from type Iα subclass have not been reported. Here, we reported dimeric structures of the tyrosine-regulated DAHPS from Escherichia coli, both in its apo form and complex with the inhibitor tyrosine at 2.5 and 2.0 Å resolutions, respectively. DAHPS(Tyr) has a typical (β/α)8 TIM barrel, which is decorated with an N-terminal extension and an antiparallel β sheet, β6a/β6b. Inhibitor tyrosine binds at a cavity formed by residues of helices α3, α4, strands β6a, β6b and the adjacent loops, and directly interacts with residues P148, Q152, S181, I213 and N8*. Although the small angle X-ray scattering profiles from DAHPS(Tyr) with and without tyrosine shows that tyrosine binding leaves most of DAHPS(Tyr) structures unaffected. The comparison of the liganded and unliganded crystal structures reveals that conformational changes of residues P148, Q152 and I213 initiate a transmission pathway to propagate the allosteric signal from the tyrosine-binding site to the active site, which is different from DAHPS(Phe), a phenylalanine-regulated isozyme from E. coli. In addition, mutations of five tyrosine-binding residues P148, Q152, S181, I213 and N8* leads to tyrosine-resistant DAHPS(Tyr) enzymes.

The proliferation of E. histolytica and its ability to invade epithelial tissues have been shown in several studies to be greatly decreased during oxidative stress. It is therefore not surprising that this amoeba has evolved several mechanisms to evade oxidative stress. Cysteine is thought to be one of the crucial molecules that help in redox defence, and a de novo cysteine biosynthetic pathway involving serine as one of the substrates has been partially elucidated in E. histolytica. Though most of the enzymes of this pathway in E. histolytica have been characterized, phosphoserine phosphatase (EhPSP), a key regulatory enzyme of the serine biosynthetic pathway, has not yet even been identified. In the current work, we identified and characterized EhPSP using various molecular, structural and functional approaches. The crystal structures of native and substrate-bound EhPSP were determined and showed the residues that play a crucial role in its phosphatase activity and substrate binding. Structural and biochemical studies indicated that EhPSP belongs to the histidine phosphatase superfamily. EhPSP-overexpressing amoebic cells were found to be more tolerant to oxidative stress. However, protection during oxidative stress was not seen when a functionally defective mutant was overexpressed.

Thus, protease inhibitors constitute important tools in the regulation of this interaction. CmPI-II is a Kazal proteinase inhibitor isolated from Cenchritis muricatus that inhibits subtilisin A, trypsin and elastases. Based on sequence analysis it defines a new group of non-classical Kazal inhibitors. Lacking solved 3D structures from this group prevents the straightforward structural comparison with other Kazal inhibitors. The 3D structure of CmPI-II, solved in this work using NMR techniques, shows the typical fold of Kazal inhibitors, but has significant differences in its N-terminal moiety, the disposition of the CysI-CysV disulfide bond and the reactive site loop (RSL) conformation. The high flexibility of its N-terminal region, the RSL, and the α-helix observed in NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, suggest a coupled motion of these regions that could explain CmPI-II broad specificity. The 3D structure of the CmPI-II/subtilisin A complex, obtained by modeling, allows understanding of the energetic basis of the subtilisin A inhibition. The residues at the P2 and P2' positions of the inhibitor RSL were predicted to be major contributors to the binding free energy of the complex, rather than those at the P1 position. Site directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the Trp14 (P2') contribution to CmPI-II/subtilisin A complex formation. Overall, this work provides the structural determinants for the subtilisin A inhibition by CmPI-II and allows the designing of more specific and potent molecules.

Currently, the standard protocol of VPP usage periodically changes the VPP position to a fresh spot during data collection. Such a protocol was to target the phase shifts to a relatively narrow range (around 90°) based on the observations of increased phase shifts and image blur associated with more images taken with a single VPP position. Here, we report a 2.87 Å resolution structure of apoferritin reconstructed from a dataset collected using only a single position of VPP. The reconstruction resolution and map density features are nearly identical to the reconstruction from the control dataset collected with periodic change of VPP positions. Further experiments have verified that similar results, including a 2.5 Å resolution structure, could be obtained with a full range of phase shifts, different spots of variable phase shift increasing rates, and at different ages of the VPP post-installation. Furthermore, we have found that the phase shifts at low resolutions, probably related to the finite size of the Volta spots, could not be correctly modeled by current CTF model using a constant phase shift at all frequencies. In dataset III, severe beam tilt issue was identified but could be computationally corrected with iterative refinements.

Regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and degradation is important for treating several diseases from orthopedic injuries to genetic deficiencies. In vivo, this process is generally regulated by proteoglycans (PGs), a family of molecules that contain both protein and glycosaminoglycan components. Recently, novel, biocompatible, semi-synthetic biomimetic proteoglycans (BPGs) were developed, which consist of an enzymatically resistant synthetic polymer core and natural chondroitin sulfate (CS) bristles. It was demonstrated that BPGs affect type I collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro, as reflected by their impact delaying the kinetic formation of gels similar to native PGs. To elucidate the interaction and the effect of BPGs on the quality of collagen fibrils, a histological technique, electron tomography, was adapted and utilized to image nano-scale structures in 2D and 3D within the tissue model. BPGs were found to aid in lateral growth and enhance fibril banding periodicity resulting in structures resembling those in native tissue. BPGs attached to collagen despite the lack of a protein core. This interaction was mediated by the CS bristle regions of the BPGs, implying that CS itself is sufficient for PG-type I tropocollagen interactions, in the absence of the protein core, with the overall nanoarchitecture of the molecule serving to affect ECM kinetics.

Functional M-Prts are also secreted and/or released from GAS cells where they exist as helical coiled-coil dimers in solution. Certain GAS strains (Pattern D) uniquely express an M-protein (plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-protein; PAM) that directly interacts with human plasminogen (hPg), a process strongly implicated in the virulence of these strains. M-Prt expressed by the emm gene is employed to serotype over 250 known strains of GAS, ∼20 of which are hitherto found to express PAMs. We have developed a modular structural model of the PAM dimer that describes the roles of different domains of this protein in various functions. While the helical COOH-terminal domains of PAM are essential for dimerization in solution, regions of its NH2-terminal domains also exhibit a weak potential to dimerize. We find that temperature controls the open (unwound) or closed (wound) states of the functional NH2-terminal domains of PAM. As temperature increases, α-helices are dramatically reduced, which concomitantly destabilizes the helical coiled-coil PAM dimers. PAMs with two a-repeats within the variable NH2-terminal A-domain (class I/III) bind to hPg tightly, but natural PAM isolates with a single a-repeat in this domain (class II) display dramatic changes in hPg binding with temperature. We conclude that coexistence of two a-repeats in PAM is critical to achieve optimal binding to hPg, especially in its monomeric form, at the biologically relevant temperature.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Unregulated pKal activity can lead to hereditary angioedema (HAE) following excess bradykinin release. HAE attacks can lead to a compromised airway that can be life threatening. As there are limited agents for prophylaxis of HAE attacks, there is a high unmet need for a therapeutic agent for regulating pKal with a high degree of specificity. Here we present crystal structures of both full-length and the protease domain of pKal, bound to two very distinct classes of small-molecule inhibitors: compound 1, and BCX4161. Both inhibitors demonstrate low nM inhibitory potency for pKal and varying specificity for related serine proteases. Compound 1 utilizes a surprising mode of interaction and upon binding results in a rearrangement of the binding pocket. Co-crystal structures of pKal describes why this class of small-molecule inhibitor is potent. Lack of conservation in surrounding residues explains the ∼10,000-fold specificity over structurally similar proteases, as shown by in vitro protease inhibition data.

The cells deposit a precursor mineral phase in vesicles, which are then exocytosed into the extracellular matrix. We observed that the entire skeleton of zebrafish larvae, is labelled within minutes after injection of calcein or FITC-dextran into the blood. This raised the possibility that there is an additional pathway of solute transport that can account for the rapid labelling. We used cryo-FIB-SEM serial block face imaging to reconstruct at high resolution the 3D ultrastructure of the caudal tail of the zebrafish larva. This reconstruction clearly shows that there is a continuous intercellular pathway from the artery to the forming bone, and from the forming bone to the vein. Fluorescence light microscopy shows that calcein and FITC-dextran form a reticulate network pattern in this tissue, which we attribute to the dye being present in the intercellular space.

Under small loads the soft tissue periodontal ligament (PDL) deforms most. However when the loads increase and the PDL is highly compressed, the tooth and the alveolar bone supporting the tooth, begin to deform. Here we report on the structure of this alveolar bone in the upper furcation region of the first molars of mature minipigs. Using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of bone cross-sections, we show that this bone is hypermineralized, containing abundant small pores around 1-5 μm in diameter, lacunae around 10-20 μm as well as larger spaces. This bone does not possess the typical lamellar motif or other repeating structures normally found in cortical or trabecular mammalian bone. We also use high resolution focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in the serial surface mode to image the 3D organization of the demineralized bone matrix. We show that the upper furcation bone matrix has a disordered isotropic structure composed mainly of individual collagen fibrils with no preferred orientation, as well as highly staining material that is probably proteoglycans. Much larger aligned arrays of collagen fibers - presumably Sharpey's fibers - are embedded in this material. This unusual furcation bone material is similar to the disordered material found in human lamellar bone. In the upper furcation region this disordered bone comprises almost all the volume excluding Sharpey's fibers.

An unique feature of our method is that it contains separate random forest models for two different use cases: (a) when the location of transmembrane regions is precisely known from a crystal structure, and (b) when it is predicted from sequence. In stark contrast to the aqueous-exposed protein segments, we found that the interaction sites located in the membrane are not enriched for evolutionary conservation, most likely due to their restricted amino acid composition or their random distribution among buried and exposed residues. On the other hand, residue co-evolution proved to be a very informative feature which has not so far been used for predicting interaction sites in individual proteins. MBPred reaches AUC, precision and recall values of 0.79/0.73, 0.69/0.51 and 0.55/0.48 on the cross-validation and independent test dataset, respectively, thus outperforming the previously published method of Bordner as well as all methods trained on globular proteins. Moreover, we show that for the majority of complete interface patches, the method captures more than 50% of the involved residues.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

 Abstract
 
 
 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a new world alphavirus which can be involved in several central nervous system disorders such as encephalitis and meningitis. The VEEV genome codes for 4 non-structural proteins (nsP), of which nsP3 contains a Macro domain. Macro domains (MD) can be found as stand-alone proteins or embedded within larger proteins in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. Their most common feature is the binding of ADP-ribose (ADPr), while several macro domains act as ribosylation writers, erasers or readers. Alphavirus MD erase ribosylation but their precise contribution in viral replication is still under investigation. NMR-driven titration experiments of ADPr in solution with the VEEV macro domain (in apo- and complex state) show that it adopts a suitable conformation for ADPr binding. Specific experiments indicate that the flexibility of the loops β5-α3 and α3-β6 is critical for formation of the complex and assists a wrapping mechanism for ADPr binding. Furthermore, along with this sequence of events, the VEEV MD undergoes a conformational exchange process between the apo state and a low-populated “dark” conformational state.

Recent studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that nucleoside catabolism supplies xanthine, a nitrogen-rich compound, to the purine ring catabolic pathway, which liberates ammonia from xanthine for reassimilation into amino acids. Similarly, pyrimidine nuclosides are degraded and the pyrimidine bases are fully catabolized. During nucleoside hydrolysis, ribose is released, and ATP-dependent ribokinase (RBSK) phosphorylates ribose to ribose-5'-phosphate to allow its entry into central metabolism recycling the sugar carbons from nucleosides. In this study, we report the crystal structure of RBSK from Arapidopsis thaliana (AtRBSK) in three different ligation states: an unliganded state, a ternary complex with ribose and ATP, and a binary complex with ATP in the presence of Mg2+. In the monomeric conformation, AtRBSK is highly homologous to bacterial RBSKs, including the binding sites for a monovalent cation, ribose, and ATP. Its dimeric conformation, however, does not exhibit the noticeable ligand-induced changes that were observed in bacterial orthologs. Only in the presence of Mg2+, ATP in the binary complex adopts a catalytically competent conformation, providing a mode of action for Mg2+ in AtRBSK activity. The structural data combined with activity analyses of mutants allowed assignment of functional roles for the active site residues. Overall, this study provides the first structural characterization of plant RBSK, and experimentally validates a previous hypothetical model concerning the general reaction mechanism of RBSK.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In bacteria these domains play roles in osmoregulation, regulation of turgor and membrane potential and in pH homeostasis. Whole-genome sequencing unveiled RCK gene redundancy, however the biological role of this redundancy is not well understood. In Bacillus subtilis, there are two closely related RCK domain proteins (KtrA and KtrC) that regulate the activity of the Ktr cation channels. KtrA has been well characterized but little is known about KtrC. We have characterized the structural and biochemical proprieties of KtrC and conclude that KtrC binds ATP and ADP, just like KtrA. However, in solution KtrC exist in a dynamic equilibrium between octamers and non-octameric species that is dependent on the bound ligand, with ATP destabilizing the octameric ring relative to ADP. Accordingly, KtrC-ADP crystal structures reveal closed octameric rings similar to those in KtrA, while KtrC-ATP adopts an open assembly with RCK domains forming a super-helix. In addition, both KtrC-ATP and -ADP octamers are stabilized by the signaling molecule cyclic-di-AMP, which binds to KtrC with high affinity. In contrast, c-di-AMP binds with 100-fold lower affinity to KtrA. Despite these differences we show with an E. coli complementation assay that KtrC and KtrA are interchangeable and able to form functional transporters with both KtrB and KtrD.

Various aminotransferases acting on a range of substrates have been reported. Aromatic transaminases are able to catalyze the transamination reaction with both aromatic and acidic substrates. Two aminotransferases from C. albicans, Aro8p and Aro9p, have been identified recently, exhibiting different catalytic properties. To elucidate the multiple substrate recognition of the two enzymes we determined the crystal structures of an unliganded CaAro8p, a complex of CaAro8p with the PLP cofactor bound to a substrate, forming an external aldimine, CaAro9p with PLP in the form of internal aldimine, and CaAro9p with a mixture of ligands that have been interpreted as results of the enzymatic reaction. The crystal structures of both enzymes contains in the asymmetric unit a biologically relevant dimer of 55 kDa for CaAro8 and 59 kDa for CaAro9p protein subunits. The ability of the enzymes to process multiple substrates could be related to a feature of their architecture in which the active site resides on one subunit while the substrate-binding site is formed by a long loop extending from the other subunit of the dimeric molecule.

The biosynthetic pathway of Choi has yet to be resolved. AerE is a cupin superfamily enzyme that was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of Choi, but its exact role remains unclear. This study reports the functional characterization and structural analyses of AerE. Enzymatic observation reveals that AerE can dramatically accelerate 1,3-allylic isomerization of the non-aromatic decarboxylation product of prephenate, dihydro-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (H2HPP). This olefin isomerization reaction can occur non-enzymatically and is the second step of the biosynthetic pathway from prephenate to Choi. The results of comparative structural analysis and substrate analogue binding geometry analysis combined with the results of mutational studies suggest that AerE employs an induced fit strategy to bind and stabilize the substrate in a particular conformation that is possibly favorable for 1,3-allylic isomerization of H2HPP through coordinate bonds, hydrogen bonds, π-π conjugation interaction and hydrophobic interactions.

One requirement of this polynomial method is the optimization of a large number of parameters, which may limit its practical applicability. In this work, we propose an alternative method for modeling the sample motion. Starting from the standard fiducial-based tilt-series alignment, the method uses the alignment residual as local estimates of the sample motion at the 3D fiducial positions. Then, a scattered data interpolation technique characterized by its smoothness and a closed-form solution is applied to model the sample motion. The motion model is then integrated in the tomographic reconstruction. The new method improves the tomogram quality similar to the polynomial one, with the important advantage that the determination of the motion model is greatly simplified, thereby overcoming one of the major limitations of the polynomial model. Therefore, the new method is expected to make the beam-induced motion correction methodology more accessible to the cryoET community.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Taking into account the rhombohedral symmetry of calcite, often presented in hexagonal axes, all this led to the long-standing opinion that calcitic prisms grow along the c-axis of calcite. In this paper, using X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we unambiguously show that calcitic prisms in pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera predominantly grow perpendicular to the c-axis. The obtained results imply that the hexagon-like habitus of growing crystallites may be not necessarily connected to calcite crystallography and, therefore, other factors should be taken into consideration.

FKBP12 binds to RyR1's cytoplasmic assembly 130 Å away from the ion gate at four equivalent sites in the RyR1 tetramer. To understand how FKBP12 binding alters RyR1's channel properties, we studied the 3D structure of RyR1 alone in the closed conformation in the context of the open and closed conformations of FKBP12-bound RyR1. We analyzed the metrics of conformational changes of existing structures, the structure of the ion gate, and carried out multivariate statistical analysis of thousands of individual cryoEM RyR1 particles. We find that under closed state conditions, in the presence of FKBP12, the cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 adopts an upward conformation, whereas absence of FKBP12 results in a relaxed conformation, while the ion gate remains closed. The relaxed conformation is intermediate between the RyR1-FKBP12 complex closed (upward) and open (downward) conformations.

It is made from calcite laths, which are inclined at a low angle to the internal shell surface, although their arrangement is different among the different groups. They are strictly ordered into folia in the anomiids, fully independent in scallops, and display an intermediate arrangement in oysters. Pectinids have particularly narrow laths characterized by their ability to change their growth direction by bending or winding, as well as to bifurcate and polyfurcate. Electron backscatter analysis indicates that the c-axes of laths are at a high, though variable, angle to the growth direction, and that the laths grow preferentially along the projection of an intermediate axis between two a-axes, although they can grow in any intermediate direction. Their main surfaces are not particular crystallographic faces. Analyses done directly on the lath surfaces demonstrate that, during the bending/branching events, all crystallographic axes remain invariant. The growth flexibility of pectinid laths makes them an excellent space-filling material, well suited to level off small irregularities of the shell growth surface. We hypothesize that the exceptional ability of laths to change their direction may be promoted by the mode of growth of biogenic calcite, from a precursor liquid phase induced by organic molecules.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

So far, this approach has primarily exploited amplification, effectively harnessing the internal folding propensity of self-compatible fragments to achieve sufficient enthalpy for folding. Here we exploit an interface-driven strategy to depart from the repeat design realm, constructing an asymmetric, globular domain from heterologous supersecondary structures. We report the successful design of a dRP lyase domain fold, which agrees with the experimental NMR structure at atomic accuracy (backbone RMSD of 0.94 Å).

Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent human colon commensal bacterial species that hydrolyzes GOS using an extracellular Glycosyl Hydrolase (GH) family GH53 endo-galactanase enzyme (BTGH53), releasing galactose-based products for growth. Here we dissect the molecular basis for GOS activity of this B. thetaiotaomicron GH53 endo-galactanase. Elucidation of its X-ray crystal structure revealed that BTGH53 has a relatively open active site cleft which was not observed with the bacterial enzyme from Bacillus licheniformis (BLGAL). BTGH53 acted on GOS with degree of polymerization ≤3 and therefore more closely resembles activity of fungal GH53 enzymes (e.g. Aspergillus aculeatus AAGAL and Meripileus giganteus MGGAL). Probiotic lactobacilli that lack galactan utilization systems constitute a group of bacteria with relevance for a healthy (infant) gut. The strains tested were unable to use GOS ≥ DP3. However, they completely consumed GOS in the presence of BTGH53, resulting in clear stimulation of their extent of growth. The extracellular BTGH53 enzyme thus may play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in complex microbial environments such as the human colon.

On comparing the structures, the two overall structures are almost identical, but it was observed that the partial conformational change was triggered by the interaction between Ser147 and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+. NAD+ binding also enhanced the strength of oligomerization interfaces formed by the core domains. Such additional interdomain interaction is in good agreement with our experimental results showing that the residual activity of NAD+-bound form was approximately three times higher than that of the apo form after incubation at 80 °C. In addition, sequence comparison of three structurally known LDHs indicated a set of candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to improve thermostability.

A specimen-independent approach through tilting has been attempted to increase particle orientation coverage, thus minimizing anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. However, focus gradient is a critical issue hindering tilt applications from being a general practice in single-particle cryo-EM. The present study describes a newly developed geometrically optimized approach, goCTF, to reliably determine the global focus gradient. A novel strategy of determining contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters from a sector of the signal preserved power spectrum is applied to increase reliability. Subsequently, per-particle based local focus refinement is conducted in an iterative manner to further improve the defocus accuracy. Novel diagnosis methods using a standard deviation defocus plot and goodness of fit heatmap have also been proposed to evaluate CTF fitting quality prior to 3D refinement.

To broaden the basis for a correct interpretation of growth marks in pig enamel, we analyzed their periodicity in teeth of wild boars and domestic pigs. For that, the numbers of enamel incremental markings were recorded in ground sections and compared with crown formation times for the respective teeth derived from literature data on tooth development and eruption in Sus scrofa. Our study revealed that laminations with a daily periodicity are the dominant incremental feature of pig enamel. In wild boar M3s, daily enamel secretion (apposition) rates ranged between a minimum of 6.1 µm in the inner and a maximum of 30.6 µm in the outer enamel. Long-period (supra-daily) incremental markings were present as perikymata at the outer enamel surface (OES). Contrary to the situation in primate enamel, in pig enamel the long-period incremental lines terminating in perikyma grooves were mostly structurally indistinguishable from the daily laminations. Typically, five sub-daily increments were present between successive laminations. The incremental pattern in pig enamel can be misinterpreted if the laminations are mistaken for long-period markings (striae of Retzius) and the sub-daily growth marks for daily prism cross-striations. The findings of the present study demonstrate the critical importance of correctly characterizing the incremental markings and their periodicity in enamel, and caution against an uncritical transfer of the interpretation of the nature of incremental markings in primate enamel to other mammalian taxa.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The remained H2O molecules on the coordination sphere of Ca2+ enable these complexes to behave partially like aquated Ca2+ ions in protein-binding. Besides, as the dominant part of prCa, albumin-bound calcium (albCa) exhibits a spectrum that closely resembles that of fCa, indicating weak interactions between the protein carboxyl groups and calcium.

Furthermore, although M1Pi has a discrete function, it surprisingly shares high structural similarity with two functionally non-related proteins such as ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase (R15Pi) and the regulatory subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). To identify the distinct structural features that lead to divergent functional obligations of M1Pi as well as to understand the mechanism of enzyme catalysis, the crystal structure of M1Pi from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 was determined. A meticulous structural investigation of the dimeric M1Pi revealed the presence of an N-terminal extension and a hydrophobic patch absent in R15Pi and the regulatory α-subunit of eIF2B. Furthermore, unlike R15Pi in which a kink formation is observed in one of the helices, the domain movement of M1Pi is distinguished by a forward shift in a loop covering the active-site pocket. All these structural attributes contribute towards a hydrophobic microenvironment in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme making it favorable for the reaction mechanism to commence. Thus, a hydrophobic active-site microenvironment in addition to the availability of optimal amino-acid residues surrounding the catalytic residues in M1Pi led us to propose its probable reaction mechanism via a cis-phosphoenolate intermediate formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The fluorescence lifetime of the superfolder green fluorescent protein (SF) and the SF protein fused with islet amyloid polypeptide (SF-IAPP) were studied in polyacrylamide gel using Fluorescent-Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). It was shown that the SF average fluorescence lifetime in gel slightly differs from that of the SF-IAPP monomer under these conditions. SF-IAPP does not lose the ability to form amyloid-like fibrils. Under the same conditions (in polyacrylamide gel), SF and SF-IAPP monomers have similar fluorescence time characteristics and the average fluorescence lifetime of SF-IAPP in fibrils significantly decreases.

Xylopyranosyl branching at the non-reducing ends of xyloglucan oligosaccharides is vital for IpeA activity. We solved the crystal structure of IpeA with isoprimeverose at 2.4 Å resolution, showing that the structure of IpeA formed a dimer and was composed of three domains: an N-terminal (β/α)8 TIM-barrel domain, α/β/α sandwich fold domain, and a C-terminal fibronectin-like domain. The catalytic TIM-barrel domain possessed a catalytic nucleophile (Asp300) and acid/base (Glu524) residues. Interestingly, we found that the cavity of the active site of IpeA was larger than that of other GH3 enzymes, and subsite -1' played an important role in its activity. The glucopyranosyl and xylopyranosyl residues of isoprimeverose were located at subsites -1 and -1', respectively.

The structure of AtPPC3, a C3 PEPC isozyme of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in complex with the inhibitors aspartate and citrate was solved at 2.2-Å resolution. This represents the first PEPC structure with citrate bound. Aspartate and citrate binding sites are in close proximity (5.1-5.3 Å) and interactions between citrate and specific residues were identified. Citrate functions as a mixed (allosteric) inhibitor as it reduced AtPPC3's Vmax while increasing Km(PEP) values. The PEP saturation data gave an excellent fit to the mixed inhibition model, yielding Ki and Ki' (citrate) values of 9.3 and 42.5 mM, respectively. Citrate and aspartate inhibition of AtPPC3 was non-additive, likely due to their closely positioned binding sites, their similar negative charge, and type of binding residues. Fewer interactions and lower affinity for citrate support its observed weaker inhibition of AtPPC3 relative to aspartate. Citrate does not appear to induce further conformational change beyond aspartate owing to the similar structural mechanism of inhibition. AtPPC3 largely exhibits root-specific expression in Arabidopsis, where it is markedly upregulated during stresses such as excessive salinity or nutritional Pi deprivation that necessitate large increases in anaplerotic PEP carboxylation.

MIF4G domains have been described to mediate interactions with DEAD-box helicases such as DDX6. However, comparison of the interfaces of the MIF4G-C with the MIF4G domain of NOT1 that interacts with DDX6 reveals key structural differences that explain why the MIF4G-C does not bind DDX6.

DcrB is found within Enterobacteriaceae, a family of Gram-negative bacteria which includes pathogens that can cause food-borne illness and hospital-acquired infections. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, DcrB is up-regulated by conditions that promote the production of known virulence factors. We determined the structure of a truncated form of DcrB from Salmonella to 1.92 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. This truncated form, DcrBΔ37, contains the entire domain of unknown function but lacks the lipoprotein signal sequence (residues 1-20) as well as residues 21-37. The DcrBΔ37 monomer contains the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold, which is found in functionally diverse proteins in mammals, yeast, plants, and cyanobacteria. Interestingly, DcrBΔ37 crystallized as a domain-swapped homodimer in which the N-terminal β-hairpin extends from one protomer to interact with the core of the second protomer. This domain-swapping indicates that the N-terminal portion of the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold likely has conformational flexibility.

We report NMR structure of the BMAP-28(1-18) and its mutated analogue mutBMAP18 in SDS micelles. Structural comparison of the peptides bound to SDS micelles and POPE-POPG vesicles using circular dichroism, suggest that structures in the two lipid preparations are similar. Antimicrobial assays show that even though both these peptides adopt helical conformation, BMAP-28(1-18) is more potent than mutBMAP18 in killing bacterial cells. Our EM images clearly indicate that the peptides target the bacterial cell membrane resulting in leakage of its contents. The structural basis for difference in activity between these peptides was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Inability of the mutBMAP18 to retain its helical structure in presence of POPE:POPG membrane as opposed to the BMAP-28(1-18) at identical peptide/lipid ratios could be responsible for its decreased activity. Residues Ser5, Arg8 and Arg12 of the BMAP-28(1-18) are crucial for its initial anchoring to the bilayer. We conclude that along with amphipathicity, a stable secondary structure that can promote/initiate membrane anchoring is key in determining membrane destabilization potential of these AMPs. Our findings are a step towards understanding the role of specific residues in antimicrobial activity of BMAP-28(1-18), which will facilitate design of smaller, cost-effective therapeutics and would also help prediction algorithms to expedite screening out variants of the parent peptide with greater accuracy.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

MutT proteins are sanitization enzymes which function by hydrolyzing such nucleotides and regulating the pool of free nucleotides in the cytoplasm. Mycobacterial genomes have a set of four MutT homologs, namely, MutT1, MutT2, MutT3 and MutT4. Mycobacterial MutT2 hydrolyzes 5 m-dCTP and 8-oxo-dGTP to their respective monophosphate products. Additionally, it can hydrolyze canonical nucleotides dCTP and CTP, with a suggested role in sustaining their optimal levels in the nucleotide pool. The structures of M. smegmatis MutT2 and its complexes with cytosine derivatives have been determined at resolutions ranging from 1.10 Å to 1.73 Å. The apo enzyme and its complexes with products (dCMP, CMP and 5 m-dCMP) crystallize in space group P21212, while those involving substrates (dCTP, CTP and 5 m-dCTP) crystallize in space group P21. The molecule takes an α/β/α sandwich fold arrangement, as observed in other MutT homologs. The nucleoside moiety of the ligands is similarly located in all the complexes, while the location of the remaining tail exhibits variability. This is the first report of a MutT2-type protein in complex with ligands. A critical interaction involving Asp116 confers the specificity of the enzyme towards cytosine moieties.

The edges of skeletal elements are of particular interest. They are subject to repeated strain and stress because they form transitions to the arthrodial membranes connecting them. These allow for relative movements of skeletal elements. In this study, we investigate structure, chemical composition, mineral organization and local mechanical properties of the anterior and posterior edges of the tergite cuticle in the conglobating beach isopod Tylos europaeus and compare these with the protective dorsal region of the tergites. The distribution of mineral phases at the edges resembles that of dorsal regions of the tergites. At the transition with the unmineralized arthrodial membrane the calcite containing distal exocuticle is replaced by epicuticular material and the subjacent cuticular layers containing amorphous calcium carbonate become enriched with amorphous calcium phosphate. At the edges, the local elastic modulus and hardness values are significantly lower compared to dorsal regions of the tergite cuticle, for both, the calcite and the amorphous mineral containing layers. The calcite within the tergite cuticle is assembled in different texture patterns: (i) almost random co-orientation, (ii) almost single crystalline calcite, and (iii) a graded organization. Calcite organization and co-orientation strength is highly variable, not only on very few tens of micrometres, but also between regions with different skeletal functionality.

Early in the sporulation process, the cell asymmetrically divides into a large compartment (the mother cell) and a smaller one (the forespore), which will maturate into a resistant spore. Proper development of the forespore requires the assembly of a multiprotein complex called the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex or ""A-Q complex"". This complex involves the forespore protein SpoIIQ and eight mother cell proteins (SpoIIIAA to SpoIIIAH), many of which share structural similarities with components of specialized secretion systems and flagella found in Gram-negative bacteria. The assembly of the A-Q complex across the two membranes that separate the mother cell and forespore was recently shown to require GerM.

The representation of three-dimensional (3D) objects with scaled basis functions permits the reconstruction of volumes at any desired scale in the real-space. This multiscale approach generates interesting opportunities in SPA for the stabilization of the initial volume problem or the 3D iterative refinement procedure. In particular, we show that reconstructions performed at coarse scale are more robust to angular errors and permit gains in computational speed. A key component of the proposed iterative scheme is its fast implementation. The costly step of reconstruction, which was previously hindering the use of advanced iterative methods in SPA, is formulated as a discrete convolution with a cost that does not depend on the number of projection directions. The inclusion of the contrast transfer function inside the imaging matrix is also done at no extra computational cost. By permitting full 3D regularization, the framework is by itself a robust alternative to direct methods for performing reconstruction in adverse imaging conditions (e.g., heavy noise, large angular misassignments, low number of projections).

Unusually, however, many of the expected orders are not observed. A possible explanation, proposed by Fraser and MacRae (1983), was that the intermediate filaments (IF) that constitute the fibrillar component of the filament/matrix texture consist of 4-chain protofilaments arranged on a surface lattice subject to a helical dislocation. The radial projection of the resulting 8-protofilament ribbon was defined in terms of a two-dimensional unit cell characterized by vectors (a, b) with axial projections za ∼ 74 Å and zb ∼ 198 Å. This situation resembles that found in microtubules, where helical dislocations in subunit packing are also encountered, leading to a so-called ""seam"" along their length (Metoz and Wade, 1997). In keratin, however, the protofilaments are helical so the seam is inclined to the axis of the IF. Here we report details of the Patterson function that provides independent evidence for both the helical dislocation and the dimensions of the surface lattice. In addition, the observed meridional X-ray amplitudes have been compared with those predicted by various models of the axial distribution of electron density. A new model, adapted from one previously proposed, fits the data significantly better than has heretofore proved possible. An interpretation of the model in terms of either specific keratin-associated-protein (KAP) binding or the retention of IF symmetry by a portion of the head and/or tail domains is suggested.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Based on three-dimensional fold, sugar-specific SBPs have been classified into cluster B and cluster D-I. The analysis of sequences and structures of sugar-binding pocket of cluster D-I SBPs revealed the presence of extra residues on two loops (L1, L2) and a helix (H1) in few members of this family, that binds specifically to monosaccharides. Presence of conserved histidine in L2 and tryptophan in H1 can be considered as the identity marks for the cluster D-I monosaccharide-binding SBPs. A glucose binding protein (ppGBP) from Pseudomonas putida CSV86 was found to contain a structural fold similar to oligosaccharide-binding cluster D-I SBPs, but functionally binds to only glucose due to constriction of its binding pocket mainly by L2 (375-382). ppGBP with partial deletion of L2 (ppGBPΔL2) was created, crystallized and biochemical characterization was performed. Compared to wild type ppGBP, the ppGBPΔL2 structure showed widening of the glucose-binding pocket with ∼80% lower glucose binding. Our results show that the substrate specificity of SBPs can be altered by modulating the size of the binding pocket. Based on this, we propose a sub classification of cluster D-I SBPs into (i) cluster D-I(a)-monosaccharide-binding SBPs and (ii) cluster D-I(b)-oligosaccharide-binding SBPs. This study also provides the direct structural and functional correlation indicating that divergence of proteins may occur through insertions or deletions of sequences in the already existing SBPs leading to evolution at the functional level.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In total, we applied Pathwalking to six density maps between 3 and 4.5 Å resolution selected from the challenge data sets. In five of the six cases, Pathwalking was able to accurately determine the protein fold and in three of these cases, the final all atom model had less than 1.6 Å RMSD when compared to the known structure. Model building and refinement was nearly completely automated, used default parameters and took less than 30 min to complete a refined all atom model. A direct outgrowth of this work was a more streamlined automated command line Pathwalking utility, as well as a novel sequence assignment and optimization routine, which attempts to register sidechain density with expected side chain volume.

As part of the challenge, metrics needed to be developed to assess and compare the quality of the different map submissions. The most common metric for assessing maps is determining the resolution by Fourier shell correlation (FSC), but there are well known instances where the resolution can be misleading. In this manuscript, we present a new approach for assessing the quality of a map by determining the map ""modelability"" rather than on resolution. We used the automated map tracing and modeling algorithms in Rosetta to generate populations of models, and then compared the populations between different map entries by the Rosetta score, RMSD to a reference model provided by the map challenge, and by pair-wise RMSDs between different models in the population. These metrics were used to determine statistically significant rankings for the map challengers for each dataset. The rankings revealed inconsistencies between the resolution by FSC, emphasized the importance of the interplay between number of particles contributing to a map and map quality, and revealed the importance of software familiarity on single particle reconstruction results. However, because multiple variables changed between map entries, it was challenging to derive best practices from the map challenge results.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

However, the physiological and pathological structures of polyS repeats are not clearly understood. Early studies highlighted their structural versatility, similar to other homopolymers whose conformation is influenced by the surrounding protein context. As polyS stretches are frequently near polyQ and polyA repeats, which can be part of coiled coil (CC) structures, and the frameshift-derived polyS repeats in HD directly flank CC heptads important for aggregation, we investigate here the structural and aggregation properties of polyS in the context of CC structures. We have taken advantage of peptide models, previously used to study polyQ and polyA in CCs, in which we inserted polyS repeats of variable length and studied them in comparison with polyQ and polyA peptides. We found that polyS repeats promote CC-mediated polymerization and fibrillization as revealed by circular dichroism, chemical crosslinking, and atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, they promote CC-based, length-dependent intracellular aggregation, which is negligible with 7 and widespread with 49 serines. These findings show that polyS repeats can participate in the formation of CCs, as previously found for polyQ and polyA, conferring to peptides distinctive structural properties with aggregation kinetics that are intermediate between those of polyA and polyQ CCs, and contribute to an overall structural definition of the pathophysiogical roles of homopolymeric repeats in CC structures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The elemental composition of the skeleton was clarified by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, suggesting that the skeletons of both groups are mainly made of amorphous silica (SiO2·nH2O) with other minor elements (Na, Mg, Al, Cl, K, Ca and Fe) and that these two groups have similar elemental composition, compared with other siliceous organisms (diatoms and sponges). However, the structural difference among the two groups was confirmed: phaeodarian skeletons are porous, unlike radiolarians with solid skeletons.

There they oligomerize into a cage that interacts with the other COPII proteins to direct vesicle formation and concentrate cargo into a bud. In this role they must be flexible to accommodate different sizes and shapes of cargo, but also have elements that provide rigidity to help deform the membrane. Here we characterize the influence the C-terminal disordered region of Sec31 has on cage flexibility and rigidity. After deleting this region (residues 820-1220), we characterized Sec13/Sec31ΔC heterotetramers biophysically and structurally through cryo-EM. Our results show that Sec13/31ΔC self-assembles into canonical cuboctahedral cages in vitro at buffer conditions similar to wild type. The distribution of cage sizes indicated that unlike the wild type, Sec13/31ΔC cages have a more homogeneous geometry. However, the structure of cuboctahedrons exhibited more conformational heterogeneity than wild type. Through localized reconstruction of cage vertices and molecular dynamics flexible fitting we found a new hinge for the flexing of Sec31 β-propeller domain and more flexibility of the previously known hinge. Together, these results show that the C-terminal region of Sec31 regulates the flexing of other domains such that flexibility and rigidity are not compromised during transport of large and/or asymmetric cargo.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

It calculates Z-scores for secondary structure elements (SSEs) and side chains. Z-scores capture how much larger the cross-correlation score (CCS) is for atoms in such features at their placed locations compared to the CCS at displaced positions. Z-scores are larger when the structural features are well-resolved, as confirmed by visual analysis. This method was applied to all 66 maps submitted to the 2015/2016 EMDB map challenge. For each map, the fitted model provided by the map committee was used in this assessment. The average Z-scores for each map and fitted model correlate moderately well with reported map resolutions (r2 = 0.45 for SSE Z-scores and r2 = 0.56 for side chain Z-scores). Rankings of the submitted maps based on average Z-scores seem to more closely agree with visual analysis. Z-scores can also be used to pinpoint which parts of a model are well-resolved in a map, and which parts of the model may need further fitting or refinement to make the model better match the density.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The shell of the pearl oyster consists of calcium carbonate and a small amount of organic matrix. Despite many studies of the shell matrix proteins, the mechanism by which calcium elements are transported from the mantle to the shell remains unclear. Investigating the molecular mechanism of calcium transportation, we prepared artificial seawater with a high concentration of calcium ions (10ASW) to induce calcification in the pearl oyster. When pearl oysters were cultured in 10ASW, unusual nanoparticles were precipitated on the surface of the nacreous layer. SDS-PAGE and 2D-PAGE analyses revealed that some calcium-sensing proteins (Sarcoplasmic Ca-binding Protein (Pf-SCP) and Pf-filamin A) might be related to the synthesis of these nanoparticles. The recombinant proteins of Pf-SCP can bind to calcium ions and accumulate nanoparticles of calcium carbonate crystals. However, transcriptomic analysis of the pearl oysters grown in 10ASW showed that the matrix protein genes in the shell did not differ before and after treatment with 10ASW. These results suggest that, despite increasing calcium transportation to the shell, treatment with a high concentration of calcium ions does not induce formation of the organic framework in the shell microstructure.

These proteins have evolved different mechanisms of metal-binding and release through sequence and thereby structure-function divergence. The CLas-ZnuA2 from Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLA), in previous studies, showed a lower metal-binding affinity. The subtle communications within and between domains from crystal structure analysis revealed that protein seems to prefer a metal-free state. The unique features of CLas-ZnuA2 included a highly restrained loop L3 and presence of a proline in linker helix. In present work, S38A and Y68F mutants were studied as they play an important role during metal-binding in CLas-ZnuA2. The mutations in linker helix could not be studied as the expressed protein was not soluble and in most cases degraded with time. The crystal structure analysis of (S38A and Y68F) mutants in metal-free and metal-bound forms showed variations in interactions, an increase in number of alternate conformations and distortions in secondary structure elements, despite a similar overall structure, suggesting alterations in internal communications.

In both structures, the FtsH hexamer is created from two different subunits of the asymmetric unit by the threefold symmetry of the crystals. Similar to other published structures, all subunits are loaded with ADP and the two subunit in the asymmetric unit resemble the already known open and closed conformations. Within the ATPase cycle while the whole subunit switches from the opened to the closed state, pore loop-1 interacts with the substrate and translocates it into the proteolytic chamber.

To gain insight into how such interactions are maintained in the highly saline cytoplasm of halophilic archaea, we determined the 3-D structure of VNG0258H/RosR, the first haloarchaeal DNA-binding protein from the extreme halophilic archaeon Halobactrium salinarum. It is a dimeric winged-helix-turn-helix (wHTH) protein with unique features due to adaptation to the halophilic environment. As ions are major players in DNA binding processes, particularly in halophilic environments, we investigated the solution structure of the ionic envelope and located anions in the first shell around the protein in the crystal using anomalous scattering. Anions that were found to be tightly bound to residues in the positively charged DNA-binding site would probably be released upon DNA binding and will thus make significant contribution to the driving force of the binding process.

Eight paired femoral diaphyses, femoral necks, and radial diaphyses were imaged using Synchrotron Radiation µCT with a 0.7 µm isotropic voxel size. The spatial resolution facilitates the investigation of the multiscale porosities of cortical bone, from the osteonal canals system down to the osteocyte lacunar system. Our results showed significant differences in the microstructural properties, regarding both osteonal canals and osteocytes lacunae, between the different anatomical locations. The radius presents significantly lower osteonal canal volume fraction and smaller osteonal canals than the femoral diaphysis or neck. Osteocytes lacunae observed in the radius are significantly different in shape than in the femur, and lacunar density is higher in the femoral neck. These results show that the radius, a non-weight-bearing bone, is significantly different in terms of its microstructure from a weight-bearing bone such as the femur.

Our assessments primarily use validation criteria from the MolProbity web service. Those criteria include MolProbity's all-atom contact analysis, updated versions of standard conformational validations for protein and RNA, plus two recent additions: first, flags for cis-nonPro and twisted peptides, and second, the CaBLAM system for diagnosing secondary structure, validating Cα backbone, and validating adjacent peptide CO orientations in the context of the Cα trace. In general, automated ab initio building of starting models is quite good at backbone connectivity but often fails at local conformation or sequence register, especially at poorer than 3.5 Å resolution. However, we show that even if criteria (such as Ramachandran or rotamer) are explicitly restrained to improve refinement behavior and overall validation scores, automated optimization of a deposited structure seldom corrects specific misfittings that start in the wrong local minimum, but just hides them. Therefore, local problems should be identified, and as many as possible corrected, before starting refinement. Secondary structures are confusing at 3-4 Å but can be better recognized at 6-8 Å. In future model challenges, specific steps being tested (such as segmentation) and the required documentation (such as PDB code of starting model) should each be explicitly defined, so competing methods on a given task can be meaningfully compared. Individual local examples are presented here, to understand what local mistakes and corrections look like in 3D, how they probably arise, and what possible improvements to methodology might help avoid them. At these resolutions, both structural biologists and end-users need meaningful estimates of local uncertainty, perhaps through explicit ensembles.

A number of mathematical techniques for accelerating the convergence rate are introduced, leading to a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude.

Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF), particularly through a resolution-exchange scheme, ReMDFF, provides a robust way of achieving this balance for hybrid structure determination. Employing two high-resolution density maps, namely that of β-galactosidase at 3.2 Å and TRPV1 at 3.4 Å, we showcase the quality of ReMDFF-generated models, comparing them against ones submitted by independent research groups for the 2015-2016 Cryo-EM Model Challenge. This comparison offers a clear evaluation of ReMDFF's strengths and shortcomings, and those of data-guided real-space refinements in general. ReMDFF results scored highly on the various metric for judging the quality-of-fit and quality-of-model. However, some systematic discrepancies are also noted employing a Molprobity analysis, that are reproducible across multiple competition entries. A space of key refinement parameters is explored within ReMDFF to observe their impact within the final model. Choice of force field parameters and initial model seem to have the most significant impact on ReMDFF model-quality. To this end, very recently developed CHARMM36m force field parameters provide now more refined ReMDFF models than the ones originally submitted to the Cryo-EM challenge.

A major virulence determinant of GAS is its dimeric signature fibrillar M-protein (M-Prt), which is evolutionarily designed in modules, ranging from a hypervariable extracellular N-terminal region to a progressively more highly conserved C-terminus that is covalently anchored to the cell wall. Of the >250 GAS isolates classified, only the subset of skin-trophic Pattern D strains expresses a specific serotype of M-Prt, PAM, that directly binds to host human plasminogen (hPg) via its extracellular NH2-terminal variable A-domain region. This interaction allows these GAS strains to accumulate components of the host fibrinolytic system on their surfaces to serve extracellular functions. While structure-function studies have been accomplished on M-Prts from Pattern A-C GAS isolates with different direct ligand binding properties compared to PAM, much less is known regarding the structure-function relationships of PAM-type M-Prts, particularly their dimerization determinants. To examine these questions, PAMs from seven GAS strains with sequence variations in the NH2-terminal ligand binding domains, as well as truncated versions of PAM, were designed and studied. The results from bioinformatic and biophysical analyses show that the different domains of PAM are disparately engaged in dimerization. From these data, we propose an experimentally-based model for PAM secondary and quaternary structures that is highly dependent on the conserved helical C-terminal C-D-domains.

Automation has become integral to this method because of the very large number of particle images required in order to overcome the typically low signal-to-noise ratio of these images. For optimal efficiency, automated data acquisition software packages typically employ some beam-image shift targeting as this method is both fast and accurate (±0.1 µm). In contrast, using only stage movement, relocation to a targeted area under low-dose conditions can only be achieved in combination with multiple iterations or long relaxation times, both reducing efficiency. Nevertheless it is well known that applying beam-image shift induces beam-tilt and with it a potential structure phase error with a phase error π/4 the highest acceptable value. This theory has been used as an argument against beam-image shift for high resolution data collection. Nevertheless, in practice many small beam-image shift datasets have resulted in 3D reconstructions beyond the π/4 phase error limit. To address this apparent contradiction, we performed cryo-EM single-particle reconstructions on a T20S proteasome sample using applied beam-image shifts corresponding to beam tilts from 0 to 10 mrad.

Using parallel, homotetrameric coiled-coil structures as a model system, we demonstrated that machine learning techniques can be used to predict structural parameters directly from the sequence. Coiled coils are regular protein structures, which are of great interest as building blocks for assembling larger nanostructures. They are composed of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other to form a supercoiled bundle. The coiled-coil bundles are defined by four basic structural parameters: topology (parallel or antiparallel), radius, degree of supercoiling, and the rotation of helices around their axes. In parallel coiled coils the latter parameter, describing the hydrophobic core packing geometry, was assumed to show little variation. However, we found that subtle differences between structures of this type were not artifacts of structure determination and could be predicted directly from the sequence. Using this information in modelling narrows the structural parameter space that must be searched and thus significantly reduces the required computational time. Moreover, the sequence-structure rules can be used to explain the effects of point mutations and to shed light on the relationship between hydrophobic core architecture and coiled-coil topology.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite the long history of image processing software development for cryoEM, uncertainty about best practices and validation remains. The Map Challenge was therefore designed to test the current state of single particle reconstruction. As the first such challenge, the participants were given the freedom to analyze the cases in whichever way they wanted. Therefore, the maps submitted feature different sizes, sampling and orientations, making assessment non-trivial. To be fair, I developed a method to pose all maps in each case in the same configuration with minimal interpolation. I assessed the quality of these maps by visual inspection and Fourier shell correlation (FSC). Comparing the even-odd FSC with an FSC calculated against a reference structure analysis, I concluded that the quality of the maps related more to the user than to other factors, such as the software package used. Poor quality maps suffer either from lack of data or poor choices made by the user. Some maps appear significantly better than a reference or consensus of other maps, indicating overfitting. Best practices to avoid problems include an understanding of the effects of reference map modifications on particle image alignment, and generating appropriate masks. Ultimately, none of the issues revealed in the Map Challenge is insurmountable, as underscored by the excellent quality of reconstructions achieved by a significant number of participants.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their structure usually comprises four α-helices arranged in various conformations including an open, V-shaped form that is generally associated with the ability to interact with membranes and/or enzymes to accentuate activity. Saposin D is required by the lysosomal hydrolase, acid ceramidase, which breaks down ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid, to display optimal activity. The structure of saposin D was previously determined in an inactive conformation, revealing a monomeric, closed and compact form. Here, we present the crystal structure of the open, V-shaped form of saposin D. The overall shape is similar to the open conformation found in other saposins with slight differences in the angles between the α-helices. The structure forms a dimer that serves to stabilize the hydrophobic surface exposed in the open form, which results in an internal, hydrophobic cavity that could be used to carry extracted membrane lipids.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we investigated the effects of different phosphorylated states of a synthesized peptide of OPN (the ASARM peptide; acidic, serine- and aspartate-rich motif) on calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) crystals, a major mineral phase of kidney stones. In vitro, phosphorylated OPN-ASARM peptides strongly inhibited COD crystal growth in solution as compared to the nonphosphorylated state, with increasing inhibitory potency correlating with the degree of peptide phosphorylation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the inhibition from the phosphopeptides resulted in distinctive, rosette-like crystal aggregates called spherulites. The OPN-ASARM peptides preferentially bound and specifically inhibited the {1 1 0} crystallographic faces of COD, as identified by combining atomic force microscopy and computational simulation approaches. These {1 1 0} surfaces of COD have high lattice calcium occupancy (exposure), providing preferential binding sites for the highly acidic peptides; binding and inhibition by OPN-ASARM peptides at the {1 1 0} faces led to crystal aggregation and intergrowth. The crystal spherulite formations obtained in vitro when using the most phosphorylated form of OPN-ASARM peptide at a high concentration, resembled crystal morphologies observed in vivo in a rat model of urolithiasis, in which crystal deposits in the kidney contain abundant OPN as revealed by immunogold labeling. A mechanistic model for spherulite formation is proposed based on the symmetry and crystallographic structure of COD, where the phosphate groups of OPN-ASARM bind to calcium atoms at [1 1 1] step risers on the COD {1 1 0} surface, inducing the periodic emergence of new COD crystals to form spherulites.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It illustrates our incomplete understanding of biological morphogenesis and demonstrates the feasibility of ecologically benign routes for materials technology. Amorphous SiO2 (silica) is taxonomically the most widespread biomineral, with diatoms, a large group of single-celled microalgae, being the most prolific producers. Silica is the main component of diatom cell walls, which exhibit species-specific patterns of pores that are hierarchically arranged and endow the material with advantageous properties. Despite recent advances in characterizing diatom biomolecules involved in biosilica morphogenesis, the mechanism of this process has remained controversial. Here we describe the in vitro synthesis of diatom-like, porous silica patterns using organic components that were isolated from biosilica of the diatom Cyclotella cryptica. The synthesis relies on the synergism of soluble biomolecules (long-chain polyamines and proteins) with an insoluble nanopatterned organic matrix. Biochemical dissection of the process revealed that the long-chain polyamines rather than the proteins are essential for efficient in vitro synthesis of the hierarchically porous silica patterns. Our results support the organic matrix hypothesis for morphogenesis of diatom biosilica and introduce organic matrices from diatoms as a new tool for the synthesis of meso- to microporous inorganic materials.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Consequently mitochondria are highly sensitive to any kind of stress to which they mainly response by disturbance of respiration, ROS production and release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Many of the physiological and molecular stress reactions of mitochondria are well known, yet there is a lack of information on corresponding stress induced structural changes. 3-D visualization of high-pressure frozen cells by FIB-SEM tomography and TEM tomography as used for the present investigation provide an excellent tool for studying structure related mitochondrial stress reactions. In the present study it is shown that mitochondria in the unicellular fresh-water algal model system Micrasterias as well as in the closely related aquatic higher plant Lemna fuse to local networks as a consequence of exposure to ionic stress induced by addition of KCl, NaCl and CoCl2. In dependence on concentration and duration of the treatment, fusion of mitochondria occurs either by formation of protuberances arising from the outer mitochondrial membrane, or by direct contact of the surface of elongated mitochondria. As our results show that respiration is maintained in both model systems during ionic stress and mitochondrial fusion, as well as formation of protuberances are reversible, we assume that mitochondrial fusion is a ubiquitous process that may help the cells to cope with stress. This may occur by interconnecting the respiratory chains of the individual mitochondria and by enhancing the buffer capacity against stress induced ionic imbalance.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Another question we were interested in testing was what the influence of particle sorting and elimination would be on the resolution and quality of 3D reconstructions. Since apoferritin is historically a challenging particle for single particle reconstruction and the authors of the original map challenge data used only a fraction of the particles present in the dataset, we focused on the apoferritin dataset for our entry. We submitted a 3.7 Å map from 25,844 particles and a 3.6 Å map from 53,334 particles and after assessment were among the best of the apoferritin maps that were submitted. Here we present the details of our reconstruction strategy and compare our strategy to that of another high-scoring apoferritin map.

The present study was designed to investigate putative peptides of the inter-crystallite space. Entities of 1-6 kDa extracted from enamel rods of erupted permanent teeth were analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) and shown to comprise N-terminal amelogenin (AMEL) peptides either containing or not containing exon 4 product. Other dominant entities consisted of an N-terminal peptide from ameloblastin (AMBN) and a series of the most hydrophobic peptides from serum albumin (ALBN). Amelogenin peptides encoded by the Y-chromosome allele were strongly detected in Enamel from male teeth. Location of N-terminal AMEL peptides as well as AMBN and ALBN, between apatite crystallites, was disclosed by immunogold scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density plots confirmed the relative abundance of these products including exon 4+ AMEL peptides that have greater capacity for binding to hydroxyapatite. Hydrophilic X and Y peptides encoded in exon 4 differ only in substitution of non-polar isoleucine in Y for polar threonine in X with reduced disruption of the hydrophobic N-terminal structure in the Y form. Despite similarity of X and Y alleles of AMEL the non-coding region upstream from exon 4 shows significant variation with implications for segregation of processing of transcripts from exon 4.

Dihedral and cubic symmetries.,"Protein assemblies are often symmetric, as this organization has many advantages compared to individual proteins. Complex protein structures thus very often possess high-order symmetries. Detection and analysis of these symmetries has been a challenging problem and no efficient algorithms have been developed so far. This paper presents the extension of our cyclic symmetry detection method for higher-order symmetries with multiple symmetry axes. These include dihedral and cubic, i.e., tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral, groups. Our method assesses the quality of a particular symmetry group and also determines all of its symmetry axes with a machine precision. The method comprises discrete and continuous optimization steps and is applicable to assemblies with multiple chains in the asymmetric subunits or to those with pseudo-symmetry. We implemented the method in C++ and exhaustively tested it on all 51,358 symmetric assemblies from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It allowed us to study structural organization of symmetric assemblies solved by X-ray crystallography, and also to assess the symmetry annotation in the PDB.

Upon sporulation initiation the bacterial cell undergoes a series of morphological transformations that result in the creation of a single dormant spore. Early in sporulation, an asymmetric cell division produces a larger mother cell and smaller forespore. Next, the mother cell septal membrane engulfs the forespore, and an essential channel, the so-called feeding-tube apparatus, is formed. This assembled channel is thought to form a transenvelope secretion complex that crosses both mother cell and forespore membranes. At least nine proteins are essential for channel formation including SpoIIQ under forespore control and the eight SpoIIIA proteins (SpoIIIAA-AH) under mother cell control. Several of these proteins share similarity with components of Gram-negative bacterial secretion systems and the flagellum. Here we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the soluble domain of SpoIIIAF to 2.7 Å resolution. Like the channel components SpoIIIAG and SpoIIIAH, SpoIIIAF adopts a conserved ring-building motif (RBM) fold found in proteins from numerous dual membrane secretion systems of distinct function. The SpoIIIAF RBM fold contains two unique features: an extended N-terminal helix, associated with multimerization, and an insertion at a loop region that can adopt two distinct conformations. The ability of the same primary sequence to adopt different secondary structure conformations is associated with protein regulation, suggesting a dual structural and regulatory role for the SpoIIIAF RBM.

Apolipoprotein-D specifically binds a range of small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and arachidonic acid and has an antioxidant function that is in part due to the reduction of peroxidised lipids by methionine-93. Therefore, apolipoprotein-D plays multiple roles throughout the body and is protective in Alzheimer's disease, where apolipoprotein-D overexpression reduces the amyloid-β burden in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Oligomerisation is a common feature of lipocalins that can influence ligand binding. The native structure of apolipoprotein-D, however, has not been conclusively defined. Apolipoprotein-D is generally described as a monomeric protein, although it dimerises when reducing peroxidised lipids. Here, we investigated the native structure of apolipoprotein-D derived from plasma, breast cyst fluid (BCF) and cerebrospinal fluid. In plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein-D was present in high-molecular weight complexes, potentially in association with lipoproteins. In contrast, apolipoprotein-D in BCF formed distinct oligomeric species. We assessed apolipoprotein-D oligomerisation using native apolipoprotein-D purified from BCF and a suite of complementary methods, including multi-angle laser light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering. Our analyses showed that apolipoprotein-D predominantly forms a ∼95 to ∼100 kDa tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed these findings and provided a structural model for apolipoprotein-D tetramer.

Yet, addressing questions of overall compositional changes within a cell - capturing the relative amounts of protein and ribosomal RNA levels and lipid content simultaneously - would require extractions and purifications with caveats due to isolation yields and detection methods. A holistic view of cellular composition would aid in the study of cellular composition and function. Here, solid state NMR is used to identify 13C NMR signatures for cellular organelles in HeLa cells without the use of any isotopic labeling. Comparisons are made with carbon spectra of subcellular assemblies including DNA, lipids, ribosomes, nuclei and mitochondria. Whole-cell comparisons are made with different mammalian cells lines, with red blood cells that lack nuclei and organelles, and with Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, treatment of mammalian cells with cycloheximide, a commonly used protein synthesis inhibitor, revealed unanticipated changes consistent with a significant increase in protein glycosylation, obvious at the whole cell level. Thus, we demonstrate that solid-state NMR serves as a unique analytical tool to catalog and compare the ratios of distinct carbon types in cells and serves as a discovery tool to reveal the workings of inhibitors such as cycloheximide on whole-cell biochemistry.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

To withstand the shear forces of blood flow and prevent embolisation, fibrin monomers form a three-dimensional polymer network that serves as an elastic scaffold for the blood clot. The complex spatial hierarchy of the fibrin meshwork, however, severely complicates the exploration of structural features, mechanical properties and molecular changes associated with the individual fibers of the clot. Here we developed a quasi-two-dimensional nanoscale fibrin matrix that enables the investigation of fibrin properties by topographical analysis using atomic force microscopy. The average thickness of the matrix was ∼50 nm, and structural features of component fibers were accessible. The matrix could be lysed with plasmin following rehydration. By following the topology of the matrix during lysis, we were able to uncover the molecular mechanisms of the process. Fibers became flexible but retained axial continuity for an extended time period, indicating that lateral interactions between protofibrils are disrupted first, but the axial interactions remain stable. Nearby fibers often fused into bundles, pointing at the presence of a cohesional force between them. Axial fiber fragmentation rapidly took place in the final step. Conceivably, the persisting axial integrity and cohesion of the fibrils assist to maintain global clot structure, to prevent microembolism, and to generate a high local plasmin concentration for the rapid, final axial fibril fragmentation. The nanoscale fibrin matrix developed and tested here provides a unique insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the structural and mechanical features of fibrin and its proteolytic degradation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their hallmark is the presence of a β-sheet structure. High resolution structural data on these systems as well as information gathered from multiple complementary analytical techniques is needed, from both a fundamental and a pharmaceutical perspective. Here, a previously reported de novo designed, pH-switchable coiled coil-based peptide that undergoes structural transitions resulting in fibril formation under physiological conditions has been exhaustively characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo-TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and solid-state NMR (ssNMR). Overall, a unique 2-dimensional carpet-like assembly composed of large coexisiting ribbon-like, tubular and funnel-like structures with a clearly resolved protofilament substructure is observed. Whereas electron microscopy and scattering data point somewhat more to a hairpin model of β-fibrils, ssNMR data obtained from samples with selectively labelled peptides are in agreement with both, hairpin structures and linear arrangements.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we use a coarse-grain approach to investigate the impact of structural changes on protein flexibility. More particularly, we focus our study on proteins presenting large-scale motions. We show how calculating directional force constants within residue pairs, and investigating their variation upon protein closure, can lead to the detection of a limited set of residues that form a structural lock in the protein's closed conformation. This lock, which is composed of residues whose side-chains are tightly interacting, highlights a new class of residues that are important for protein function by stabilizing the closed structure, and that cannot be detected using earlier tools like local rigidity profiles or distance variations maps, or alternative bioinformatics approaches, such as coevolution scores.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Cryo-EM can tolerate heterogeneous specimens, however, high-resolution efforts demand highly optimized samples. Therefore, significant pre-screening and evaluation is essential before a final dataset can be obtained. While cryo-EM is comparably slow and requires access to expensive high-end electron microscopes, room temperature negative stain EM is fast, inexpensive and provides immediate feedback. This has made it a popular approach for sample quality control in the early phases of a project. Optimization in negative stain can be critical not only for cryo-EM, but also for X-ray crystallography, as highlighted for example by studies on GPCR complexes (Kang et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2012). However, when not done carefully and interpreted correctly, negative stain can be prone to artifacts. A typical problem, which is often overlooked in the interpretation of EM data of small membrane proteins, is the background, caused by empty detergent micelles, as it can be easily confused with detergent embedded protein samples. To counteract this ubiquitous problem, we present a case study on commonly used detergents.We show that most detergents produce significant background in negative stain EM, even below nominal critical micelle concentration (CMC). Unawareness of such artefacts can lead to misinterpretation of sample quality and homogeneity.

The abundant heterotrimeric type I collagen composed of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain is efficiently cleaved by MMP-1 at a unique site in the triple helix, a process which may be initiated by local unfolding within the peptide chains. Atypical homotrimers of the α1(I) chain, found in embryonic and cancer tissues, are very resistant to MMP cleavage. To investigate MMP-1 cleavage, recombinant homotrimers were constructed with sequences from the MMP cleavage regions of human collagen chains inserted into a host bacterial collagen protein system. All triple-helical constructs were cleaved by MMP-1, with α2(I) homotrimers cleaved efficiently at a rate similar to that seen for α1(II) and α1(III) homotrimers, while α1(I) homotrimers were cleaved at a much slower rate. The introduction of destabilizing Gly to Ser mutations within the human collagenase susceptible region of the α2(I) chain did not interfere with MMP-1 cleavage. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated a greater degree of transient hydrogen bond breaking in α2(I) homotrimers compared with α1(I) homotrimers at the MMP-1 cleavage site, and showed an extensive disruption of hydrogen bonding in the presence of a Gly to Ser mutation, consistent with chymotrypsin digestion results. This study indicates that α2(I) homotrimers are susceptible to MMP-1, proves that the presence of an α1(I) chain is not a requirement for α2(I) cleavage, and supports the importance of local unfolding of α2(I) in collagenase cleavage.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The clinical consequences of such mutations range from mild to lethal, with more serious clinical severity associated with larger Gly replacement residues. Here, we investigate the influence of the identity of the residue replacing Gly within and adjacent to the integrin binding 502GFPGER507 sequence on triple-helix structure, stability and integrin binding using a recombinant bacterial collagen system. Recombinant collagens were constructed with Gly substituted by Ala, Ser or Val at four positions within the integrin binding region. All constructs formed a stable triple-helix structure with a small decrease in melting temperature. Trypsin was used to probe local disruption of the triple helix, and Gly to Val replacements made the triple helix trypsin sensitive at three of the four sites. Any mutation at Gly505, eliminated integrin binding, while decreased integrin binding affinity was observed in the replacement of Gly residues at Gly502 following the order Val > Ser > Ala. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that all Gly replacements led to transient disruption of triple-helix interchain hydrogen bonds in the region of the Gly replacement.

In the A-band titin is associated with the myosin thick filament. It has been speculated that titin may serve as a blueprint for thick-filament formation due to the super-repeat structure of its A-band domains. Accordingly, titin might provide a template that determines the length and structural periodicity of the thick filament. Here we tested the titin ruler hypothesis by mixing titin and myosin at in situ stoichiometric ratios (300 myosins per 12 titins) in buffers of different ionic strength (KCl concentration range 100-300 mM). The topology of the filamentous complexes was investigated with atomic force microscopy. We found that the samples contained distinct, segregated populations of titin molecules and myosin thick filaments. We were unable to identify complexes in which myosin molecules were regularly associated to either mono- or oligomeric titin in either relaxed or stretched states of the titin filaments. Thus, the electrostatically driven self-association is stronger in both myosin and titin than their binding to each other, and it is unlikely that titin functions as a geometrical template for thick-filament formation. However, when allowed to equilibrate configurationally, long myosin thick filaments appeared with titin oligomers attached to their surface. The titin meshwork formed on the thick-filament surface may play a role in controlling thick-filament length by regulating the structural dynamics of myosin molecules and placing a mechanical limit on the filament length.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In present work, we have solved the crystal structure of the human MYRF-DBD to 1.85-Å resolution. It exhibits a typical s-type Ig-fold and packs as symmetric trimeric form in the crystal via hydrogen-bond networks in three regions. Accordingly, we identified a couple of key residues on MYRF-DBD, which might play important roles in DNA-binding, in particular Arg521 on its C-terminal tail. The R521A mutant of DBD showed only 17% affinity to dsDNA targets compared to wild-type DBD.

These layers are categorized mainly by the form of crystalline calcite. Whether there exist other layer structures, how the membrane layer is transformed to the carbonate one, what form the carbonate takes after the transition. These questions remain to be clarified. Here we examine the eggshell of chicken Gallus domesticus by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. We find that there exists another layer structure defined by variation of organic matrices. The transition from the membrane to the mammillary cones is implemented through the calcium reserve assemblies or the mammillary cores. The integrity of the transitional structure was weakens as the reserved calcium is displaced, and loses completely in about 10 days of incubation. As the first deposited carbonate layer after the transition, the mammillary cones comprise amorphous calcium carbonate and clusters/assemblies of calcite crystallites the size about a nanometer, plus bubble pores extending preferentially in the lateral direction.

The skin's barrier capacity is located to an intercellular lipid structure embedding the cells of the superficial most layer of skin - the stratum corneum. According to the splayed bilayer model (Iwai et al., 2012) the lipid structure is organized as stacked bilayers of ceramides in a splayed chain conformation with cholesterol associated with the ceramide sphingoid moiety and free fatty acids associated with the ceramide fatty acid moiety. However, knowledge about the lipid structure's detailed molecular organization, and the roles of its different lipid constituents, remains circumstantial. Starting from a molecular dynamics model based on the splayed bilayer model, we have, by stepwise structural and compositional modifications, arrived at a thermodynamically stable molecular dynamics model expressing simulated electron microscopy patterns matching original cryo-electron microscopy patterns from skin extremely closely. Strikingly, the closer the individual molecular dynamics models' lipid composition was to that reported in human stratum corneum, the better was the match between the models' simulated electron microscopy patterns and the original cryo-electron microscopy patterns. Moreover, the closest-matching model's calculated water permeability and thermotropic behaviour were found compatible with that of human skin. The new model may facilitate more advanced physics-based skin permeability predictions of drugs and toxicants.

In this article we introduce an approach to estimate the DED camera gain at each pixel from the movies themselves. This gain is needed to have the set of recorded frames into a coherent gray level range, homogeneous over the whole image. The algorithm does not need any other input than the DED movie itself, being capable of providing an estimate of the camera gain image, helping to identify dead pixels and cases of incorrectly calibrated cameras. We propose the algorithm to be used either to validate the experimentally acquired gain image (for instance, to follow its possible change over time) or to verify that there is no residual gain image after experimentally correcting for the camera gain.

As a unique intracellular signaling domain, the SEFIR-SEFIR interactions mediate physical protein-protein interactions in the immune signaling network, especially the IL-17- and IL-25-mediated pathways. However, due to the lack of structural information, the detailed molecular mechanism for SEFIR-SEFIR assembly remains unclear. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of a prokaryotic SEFIR domain from Bacillus cereus F65185 (BcSEFIR), where the SEFIR domain is located at the N terminus. The structure of BcSEFIR revealed two radically distinct SEFIR-SEFIR interaction modes. In the asymmetric form, the C-terminal tail of one SEFIR binds to the helix αA and βB-αB' segment of the other one, while in the symmetric form, the helices ηC and αE and the DE-segment compose the inter-protomer interface. The C-terminal tail of BcSEFIR, critical for asymmetric interaction, is highly conserved among the SEFIR domains of Act1 orthologs from different species, in particular three absolutely conserved residues that constitute an EXXXXPP motif. In the symmetric interaction mode, the most significant contacts made by residues on helix αE are highly conserved in Act1 SEFIR domains, constituted an RLI/LXE motif.

The availability of robust insect cell lines, serum-free media, a range of vectors and commercially-packaged kits have supported the demand for maximizing the exploitation of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Naturally, this resulted in varied strategies adopted by different laboratories to optimize protein production. Most laboratories have preference in using either the E. coli transposition-based recombination bacmid technology (e.g. Bac-to-Bac®) or homologous recombination transfection within insect cells (e.g. flashBAC™).

The standard GMM algorithm employs an EM algorithm to determine the parameters. It accepted a set of 3D points with weights, corresponding to voxel or atomic centers. Although the standard algorithm worked reasonably well; however, it had three problems. First, it ignored the size (voxel width or atomic radius) of the input, and thus it could lead to a GMM with a smaller spread than the input. Second, the algorithm had a singularity problem, as it sometimes stopped the iterative procedure due to a Gaussian function with almost zero variance. Third, a map with a large number of voxels required a long computation time for conversion to a GMM. To solve these problems, we have introduced a Gaussian-input GMM algorithm, which considers the input atoms or voxels as a set of Gaussian functions. The standard EM algorithm of GMM was extended to optimize the new GMM. The new GMM has identical radius of gyration to the input, and does not suddenly stop due to the singularity problem. For fast computation, we have introduced a down-sampled Gaussian functions (DSG) by merging neighboring voxels into an anisotropic Gaussian function. It provides a GMM with thousands of Gaussian functions in a short computation time. We also have introduced a DSG-input GMM: the Gaussian-input GMM with the DSG as the input.

Comparison of the XYP and NYH enzymes shows that the two subfamilies mainly differ in the first half of their Rossmann fold.

We review our recent solid-state NMR studies of two virus membrane proteins whose conformational equilibrium is tightly coupled to membrane curvature. The influenza M2 proton channel has a drug-binding site in the transmembrane (TM) pore. Previous chemical shift data indicated that this pore-binding site is lost in an M2 construct that contains the TM domain and a curvature-inducing amphipathic helix. We have now obtained chemical shift perturbation, protein-drug proximity, and drug orientation data that indicate that the pore-binding site is restored when the full cytoplasmic domain is present. This finding indicates that the curvature-inducing amphipathic helix distorts the TM structure to interfere with drug binding, while the cytoplasmic tail attenuates this effect. In the second example, we review our studies of a parainfluenza virus fusion protein that merges the cell membrane and the virus envelope during virus entry. Chemical shifts of two hydrophobic domains of the protein indicate that both domains have membrane-dependent backbone conformations, with the β-strand structure dominating in negative-curvature phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) membranes. 31P NMR spectra and 1H-31P correlation spectra indicate that the β-strand-rich conformation induces saddle-splay curvature to PE membranes and dehydrates them, thus stabilizing the hemifusion state.

The algorithm only requires a set of manually drawn contours that roughly demarcate the cell boundary at routine slice intervals (every 50th, for example). The algorithm correctly classified pixels within the single cell with 97% accuracy when compared to manual segmentations. One entire cell and the partial volumes of two cells were segmented. Analysis of segmentations within these cells showed that myofibrils and mitochondria occupied 47.5% and 51.6% on average respectively, while the nuclei occupy 0.7% of the cell for which the entire volume was captured in the SBF-SEM dataset. Mitochondria clustering increased at the periphery of the nucleus region and branching points of the cardiac cell. The segmentations also showed high area fraction of mitochondria (up to 70% of the 2D image slice) in the sub-sarcolemmal region, whilst it was closer to 50% in the intermyofibrillar space.

Importantly, the increase in diversity is achieved without a loss in the quality of the designed sequences assessed by their resemblance to natural sequences.

The siderophore desferrioxamine E plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis by scavenging iron from the host. DfoJ, DfoA and DfoC are the enzymes responsible for desferrioxamine production starting from lysine. We have determined the crystal structures of each enzyme in the desferrioxamine E pathway and demonstrate that the biosynthesis involves the concerted action of DfoJ, followed by DfoA and lastly DfoC.

Here we compare two such techniques: electron tomography in conjunction with axial bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM), and serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). The advantages and limitations of each technique are illustrated by their application to determining the 3D ultrastructure of human blood platelets, by considering specimen geometry, specimen preparation, beam damage and image processing methods. Many features of the complex membranes composing the platelet organelles can be determined from both approaches, although STEM tomography offers a higher ∼3 nm isotropic pixel size, compared with ∼5 nm for SBF-SEM in the plane of the block face and ∼30 nm in the perpendicular direction. In this regard, we demonstrate that STEM tomography is advantageous for visualizing the platelet canalicular system, which consists of an interconnected network of narrow (∼50-100 nm) membranous cisternae. In contrast, SBF-SEM enables visualization of complete platelets, each of which extends ∼2 µm in minimum dimension, whereas BF-STEM tomography can typically only visualize approximately half of the platelet volume due to a rapid non-linear loss of signal in specimens of thickness greater than ∼1.5 µm.

Here we present a comparative study to address the behavior of different data sets during image processing and quantify important parameters during structure refinement. The automated data collection was done from the same human ribosome sample either as a conventional defocus range dataset or with a Volta phase plate close to focus (cfVPP) or with a small defocus (dfVPP). The analysis of image processing parameters shows that dfVPP data behave more robustly during cryo-EM structure refinement because particle alignments, Euler angle assignments and 2D & 3D classifications behave more stably and converge faster. In particular, less particle images are required to reach the same resolution in the 3D reconstructions. Finally, we find that defocus range data collection is also applicable to VPP. This study shows that data processing and cryo-EM map interpretation, including atomic model refinement, are facilitated significantly by performing VPP cryo-EM, which will have an important impact on structural biology.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previously we demonstrated the power of data variance analysis for characterizing regions of cryo EM density that displayed functionally important variance anomalies associated with maturation cleavage events in Nudaurelia Omega Capensis Virus and the presence or absence of a maturation protease in bacteriophage HK97 procapsids. Here we extend the analysis in two ways. First, instead of imposing icosahedral symmetry on every particle in the data set during the variance analysis, we only assume that the data set as a whole has icosahedral symmetry. This change removes artifacts of high variance along icosahedral symmetry axes, but retains all of the features previously reported in the HK97 data set. Second we present a covariance analysis that reveals correlations in structural dynamics (variance) between the interior of the HK97 procapsid with the protease and regions of the exterior (not seen in the absence of the protease). The latter analysis corresponds well with hydrogen deuterium exchange studies previously published that reveal the same correlation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although the signaling pathways are known, how these molecular mechanisms respond to changes in the intracellular microenvironment such as pH, ionic strength, and temperature, remains elusive. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to differentiate the structural dynamics of the NF-κB Inducing Kinase (NIK), a protein kinase responsible for invoking the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, in its native and mutant form, and in the absence and presence of salt concentration in efforts to probe whether changes in the ionic environment stabilize or destabilize the NIK dimer. Analyses of structure-activity and conformational-activity relationships indicate that the protein-protein interactions are sensitive to changes in the ionic strength.

Diaminopropionate ammonia lyase (DAPAL), a fold type II PLP-dependent enzyme, degrades both the D and L forms of diaminopropionic acid (DAP) to pyruvate and ammonia. Earlier studies on the Escherichia coli DAPAL (EcDAPAL) had suggested that a disulfide bond located close to the active site may be crucial for maintaining the geometry of the substrate entry channel and the active site. In order to obtain further insights into the catalytic properties of DAPAL, structural and functional studies on Salmonella typhimurium DAPAL (StDAPAL) were initiated. The three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of StDAPAL was determined at 2.5 Å resolution. As expected, the polypeptide fold and dimeric organization of StDAPAL is similar to those of EcDAPAL. A phosphate group was located in the active site of StDAPAL and expulsion of this phosphate is probably essential to bring Asp125 to a conformation suitable for proton abstraction from the substrate (D-DAP). The unique disulfide bond of EcDAPAL was absent in StDAPAL, although the enzyme displayed comparable catalytic activity. Site directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation in EcDAPAL followed by functional and biophysical studies further confirmed that the disulfide bond is not necessary either for substrate binding or for catalysis. The activity of StDAPAL but not EcDAPAL was enhanced by monovalent cations suggesting subtle differences in the active site geometries of these two closely related enzymes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

As potential anti-flu drugs with unique functions, NA inhibitors are greatly concerned by the worldwide scientists. It has been reported recently that one of the novel quindoline derivatives named 7a, could inhibit both A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) NA (NAPR) and A/California/04/09 (H1N1) NA (NACA). However, potential structure differences in the active site could be easily detected between the NAPR and NACA according to the flexibilities of their 150-loops located catalytic site. And no obvious 150-cavity could be observed in NACA crystal structure. In order to explore whether 7a could trigger the inhibition against these two NAs in the same way, a serial molecular dynamics simulation approach were applied in this study. The results indicated that 7a could be adopted under a relatively extended pose in the active center of NAPR. While in NACA-7a complex, the derivate preferred to be recognized and located on the side of active center. Interestingly, the potential of 7a was also found to be able to change the flexibility of the 150-loop in NACA that is absent of 150-cavity. Furthermore, a 150-cavity-like architecture could be induced in the active site of NACA. The results of this study revealed two kinds of binding modes of this novel small molecule inhibitor against NAs that might provide a theoretical basis for proposing novel inhibition mechanism and developing future influenza A virus inhibitors.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, the contents of cellular tomograms are often complex, making it difficult to automatically isolate different in situ cellular components. In this paper, we propose a convolutional autoencoder-based unsupervised approach to provide a coarse grouping of 3D small subvolumes extracted from tomograms. We demonstrate that the autoencoder can be used for efficient and coarse characterization of features of macromolecular complexes and surfaces, such as membranes. In addition, the autoencoder can be used to detect non-cellular features related to sample preparation and data collection, such as carbon edges from the grid and tomogram boundaries. The autoencoder is also able to detect patterns that may indicate spatial interactions between cellular components. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our autoencoder can be used for weakly supervised semantic segmentation of cellular components, requiring a very small amount of manual annotation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Early in this developmental process, the cell undergoes an asymmetric cell division that produces the larger mother cell and smaller forespore, the latter destined to become the mature spore. The mother cell septal membrane then engulfs the forespore, at which time an essential channel, the so-called feeding-tube apparatus, is thought to cross both membranes to create a direct conduit between the cells. At least nine proteins are required to form this channel including SpoIIQ under forespore control and SpoIIIAA-AH under the mother cell control. Several of these proteins share similarity to components of Type-II, -III and -IV secretion systems as well as the flagellum from Gram-negative bacteria. Here we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of the cytosolic domain of SpoIIIAB to 2.3 Å resolution. This domain adopts a conserved, secretion-system related fold of a six membered anti-parallel helical bundle with a positively charged membrane-interaction face at one end and a small groove at the other end that may serve as a binding site for partner proteins in the assembled apparatus. We analyzed and identified potential interaction interfaces by structure-guided mutagenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we were able to identify a remarkable structural homology to the C-subunit of a bacterial V-ATPase. Collectively, our data provides new insight into the possible roles of SpoIIIAB protein within the secretion-like apparatus essential to bacterial sporulation.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

However, while they have the potential to cause serious harm, they are increasingly being utilised for therapeutic applications. BoNTs comprise of seven distinct serotypes termed BoNT/A through BoNT/G, with the most widely characterised being sub-serotype BoNT/A1. Each BoNT consists of three structurally distinct domains, a binding domain (HC), a translocation domain (HN), and a proteolytic domain (LC). The HC domain is responsible for the highly specific targeting of the neurotoxin to neuronal cell membranes. Here, we present two high-resolution structures of the binding domain of subtype BoNT/A3 (HC/A3) and BoNT/A4 (HC/A4) at 1.6 Å and 1.34 Å resolution, respectively. The structures of both proteins share a high degree of similarity to other known BoNT HC domains whilst containing some subtle differences, and are of benefit to research into therapeutic neurotoxins with novel characteristics.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

After Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) binding, the ligand-receptor complex can translocate to the nucleus where it functions in oncological processes. By three-dimensional quantification analysis of super-resolution microscopy images, we verified the translocation kinetics of fluorescent conjugated EGF to the nucleus in two mesenchymal cell types: human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASC) and SK-HEP-1 tumor cells. The number of EGF clusters in the nucleus does not change after 10 min of stimulation with EGF in both cells. The total volume occupied by EGF clusters in the nucleus of hASC also does not change after 10 min of stimulation with EGF. However, the total volume of EGF clusters increases only after 20 min in SK-HEP-1 cells nuclei. In these cells the nuclear volume occupied by EGF is 3.2 times higher than in hASC after 20 min of stimulation, indicating that translocation kinetics of EGF differs between these two cell types. After stimulation, EGF clusters assemble in larger clusters in the cell nucleus in both cell types, which suggests specific sub-nuclear localizations of the receptor. Super-resolution microscopy images show that EGF clusters are widespread in the nucleoplasm, and can be localized in nuclear envelope invaginations, and in the nucleoli. The quantitative study of EGF-EGFR complex translocation to the nucleus may help to unravel its roles in health and pathological conditions, such as cancer.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

CBS catalyzes the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to form cystathionine, which is subsequently converted into cysteine. Besides maintaining cellular sulfur amino acid homeostasis, CBS also catalyzes multiple hydrogen sulfide-generating reactions using cysteine and homocysteine as substrates. In mammals, CBS is activated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), where it can adopt two different conformations (basal and activated), but exists as a unique highly active species in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present the crystal structure of CBS from honeybey Apis mellifera, which shows a constitutively active dimeric species and let explain why the enzyme is not allosterically regulated by AdoMet. In addition, comparison of available CBS structures unveils a substrate-induced closure of the catalytic cavity, which in humans is affected by the AdoMet-dependent regulation and likely impaired by the homocystinuria causing mutation T191M.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography to describe the structure of the trypanosome transition zone (TZ). At the base of the TZ, nine transition fibres irradiate from the B microtubule of each doublet towards the membrane. The TZ adopts a 9 + 0 structure throughout its length of ∼300 nm and its lumen contains an electron-dense structure. The proximal portion of the TZ has an invariant length of 150 nm and is characterised by a collarette surrounding the membrane and the presence of electron-dense material between the membrane and the doublets. The distal portion exhibits more length variation (from 55 to 235 nm) and contains typical Y-links. STEM analysis revealed a more complex organisation of the Y-links compared to what was reported by conventional transmission electron microscopy. Observation of the very early phase of flagellum assembly demonstrated that the proximal portion and the collarette are assembled early during construction. The presence of the flagella connector that maintains the tip of the new flagellum to the side of the old was confirmed and additional filamentous structures making contact with the membrane of the flagellar pocket were also detected. The structure and potential functions of the TZ in trypanosomes are discussed, as well as its mode of assembly.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) the genes (ribD/G, ribE, ribA, ribH and ribT) which are involved in riboflavin biosynthesis are organized in an operon referred as rib operon. All the genes of rib operon are characterized functionally except for ribT. The ribT gene with unknown function is found at the distal terminal of rib operon and annotated as a putative N-acetyltransferase. Here, we report the crystal structure of ribT from B. subtilis (bribT) complexed with coenzyme A (CoA) at 2.1 Å resolution determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Our structural study reveals that bribT is a member of GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily and contains all the four conserved structural motifs that have been in other members of GNAT superfamily. The members of GNAT family transfers the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to a variety of substrates. Moreover, the structural analysis reveals that the residues Glu-67 and Ser-107 are suitably positioned to act as a catalytic base and catalytic acid respectively suggesting that the catalysis by bribT may follow a direct transfer mechanism.

These complexes are intrinsically flexible, and structural changes are essential to their functions. To perform a large-scale automated analysis of the structural changes of complexes, we combined two original methods. An application, SCPC, compares two structures of protein complexes and decides the match of binding mode. Another application, Motion Tree, identifies rigid-body motions in various sizes and magnitude from the two structural complexes with the same binding mode. This approach was applied to all available homodimers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We defined two complex-specific motions: interface motion and subunit-spanning motion. In the former, each subunit of a complex constitutes a rigid body, and the relative movement between subunits occurs at the interface. In the latter, structural parts from distinct subunits constitute a rigid body, providing the relative movement spanning subunits. All structural changes were classified and examined. It was revealed that the complex-specific motions were common in the homodimers, detected in around 40% of families. The dimeric interfaces were likely to be small and flat for interface motion, while large and rugged for subunit-spanning motion. Interface motion was accompanied by a drastic change in contacts at the interface, while the change in the subunit-spanning motion was moderate. These results indicate that the interface properties of homodimers correlated with the type of complex-specific motion. The study demonstrates that the pipeline of SCPC and Motion Tree is useful for the massive analysis of structural change of protein complexes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False
