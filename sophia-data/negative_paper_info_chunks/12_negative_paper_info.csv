Binding to collagen is mediated by the extracellular-matrix protein adhesin-A (EmaA). EmaA is a homotrimeric autotransporter protein that forms flexible antenna-like appendages on the bacterium surface. An ellipsoidal structure at the distal end of the appendage, composed of three subdomains, contains the functional domain of the molecule. A correlation between amino-acid sequence and subdomain structure (SI and SII) was proposed based on an analysis of the volume/molecular weight ratio. EmaA from three mutant strains (deletions of amino-acids 70-206 and 70-386 and a substitution mutation G162S) has been studied by electron microscopy to test this hypothesis. 3D structures were analyzed using single-axis tilt tomography of negatively stained preparations of bacteria combined with subvolume averaging. Additionally, a large number of 2D images of the apical domain of the adhesins from the mutants were extracted from micrographs of the bacterial surface, aligned and classified. The combined data showed that amino-acids 70-206 localize to subdomain SI and 70-386 comprise subdomains SI and SII. Moreover, we showed that the substitution mutation G162S, which abolishes collagen binding activity, does not affect the overall structural integrity of the functional domain. However, the structure of subdomain SI in this mutant is slightly altered with respect to the wild-type strain. These data also have allowed us to interpret the architectural features of each subdomain of EmaA in more detail and to correlate the 3D structure of the functional domain of EmaA with the amino-acid sequence.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Among other factors, the type of spatial CH organization within a given articular surface depends on whether the cartilage has been derived from an intact joint or the joint is affected by osteoarthritis (OA). Furthermore, specific variations of the type of spatial organization are associated with particular states of OA. This association may prove relevant for early disease recognition based on a quantitative structural characterization of CH patterns. Therefore, we present a point process model describing the distinct morphology of CH patterns within the articular surface of intact human cartilage. This reference model for intact CH organization can be seen as a first step towards a model-based statistical diagnostic tool. Model parameters are fitted to fluorescence microscopy data by a novel statistical methodology utilizing tools from cluster and principal component analysis. This way, the complex morphology of surface CH patters is represented by a relatively small number of model parameters. We validate the point process model by comparing biologically relevant structural characteristics between the fitted model and data derived from photomicrographs of the human articular surface using techniques from spatial statistics.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It contains three BRCT (BRCA1-carboxyl terminal) domains. The N-terminal region directly binds with chromatin remodeling complex SWI-SNF, and the C-terminal BRCT2-BRCT3 domains (tandem BRCT domains) are involved in cellular DNA damage response. The MCPH1 gene associates with evolution of brain size, and its variation can cause primary microcephaly. In this study we solve the crystal structures of MCPH1 natural variant (A761) C-terminal tandem BRCT domains alone as well as in complex with γH2AX tail. Compared with other structures of tandem BRCT domains, the most significant differences lie in phosphopeptide binding pocket. Additionally, fluorescence polarization assays demonstrate that MCPH1 tandem BRCT domains show a binding selectivity on pSer +3 and prefer to bind phosphopeptide with free COOH-terminus. Taken together, our research provides new structural insights into BRCT-phosphopeptide recognition mechanism.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We have resolved individual nucleosomes in these tomograms in order to provide a 3D view of the arrangement of nucleosomes within chromatin fibers at different compaction states. With an optimized template matching procedure we obtained accurate positions and orientations of nucleosomes in open chromatin in ""low-salt"" conditions (5 mM NaCl). The mean value of the planar angle between three consecutive nucleosomes is 70°, and the mean center-to-center distance between consecutive nucleosomes is 22.3 nm. Since the template matching approach was not effective in crowded conditions, for nucleosome detection in compact fibers (40 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl(2)) we developed the nucleosome detection procedure based on the watershed algorithm, followed by sub-tomogram alignment, averaging, and classification by Principal Components Analysis. We find that in compact chromatin the nucleosomes are arranged with a predominant face-to-face stacking organization, which has not been previously shown for native isolated chromatin. Although the path of the DNA cannot be directly seen in compact conditions, it is evident that the nucleosomes stack with their dyad axis aligned in forming a ""double track"" conformation which is a consequence of DNA joining adjacent nucleosome stacks. Our data suggests that nucleosome stacking is an important mechanism for generating chromatin compaction in vivo.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Each NPC is composed of about 30 different proteins (nucleoporins or Nups), which exist in multiple (8, 16 or 32) copies within the NPC scaffold. Recently, we have identified and characterized the large structural Nups, Nup188 and Nup192, from the thermophilic eukaryote Chaetomium thermophilum, which exhibited superior properties for biochemical and structural studies, when compared to their mesophilic orthologs. Here, we study the large structural Nups from the model organism yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data show that yeast Nup188 like its thermophilic orthologue ctNup188 exhibits a twisted S-like structure, which flexibly binds the linker nucleoporin Nic96 via a short conserved α-helix motif.

The different structures of the tooth, jaw bone and the intervening soft periodontal ligament enable the tooth to endure repeated loading during mastication. Although mechanical and functional properties of the different components are thoroughly investigated, the manner in which the whole tooth functions under load is still enigmatic. A custom-made loading system inside a microCT scanner was used to directly visualize the root movements in relation to the jaw bone as the rat molar tooth was loaded. At low loads no contact was observed between the root surface and the bone, whereas at higher loads three specific contact areas between the root surface and the jaw bone were observed. These contact areas restrict tooth movement in the buccal-lingual direction, but enable the tooth to rock in a ""seesaw"" like manner in the distal-mesial direction. The contact areas appear to play a role in determining tooth motion and in turn define the manner in which the whole tooth moves when loaded. These observations are important for understanding basic structure-function relations of the tooth-PDL-bone system, and have direct implications for better understanding pathological and therapeutic processes in orthodontics, periodontics and jaw bone regeneration.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is composed largely of a polymeric assembly of lamins, which comprise a distinct sequence homology class of the intermediate filament protein family. On the basis of its structural properties, the lamina originally was proposed to provide scaffolding for the nuclear envelope and to promote anchoring of chromatin and nuclear pore complexes at the nuclear surface. This viewpoint has expanded greatly during the past 25 years, with a host of surprising new insights on lamina structure, molecular composition and functional attributes. It has been established that the self-assembly properties of lamins are very similar to those of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins, and that the lamin polymer is physically associated with components of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton and with a multitude of chromatin and inner nuclear membrane proteins. Cumulative evidence points to an important role for the lamina in regulating signaling and gene activity, and in mechanically coupling the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton to the nucleus. The significance of the lamina has been vaulted to the forefront by the discovery that mutations in lamins and lamina-associated polypeptides lead to an array of human diseases. A key future challenge is to understand how the lamina integrates pathways for mechanics and signaling at the molecular level. Understanding the structure of the lamina from the atomic to supramolecular levels will be essential for achieving this goal.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

To avoid the damage induced by electron irradiation, images of frozen hydrated biological specimens are generally acquired under low-dose conditions, resulting in weakly contrasted images that are difficult to interpret, and in which ultrastructural details remain ambiguous. Zernike phase contrast transmission electron microscopy can improve contrast, and can also fix a fatal problem related to the inherent low contrast of conventional electron microscopy, namely, image modulation due to the unavoidable setting of deep defocus. In this study, we applied cryo-electron tomography enhanced with a Zernike phase plate, which avoids image modulation by allowing in-focus setting. The Zernike phase contrast cryo-electron tomography has a potential to suppress grainy background generation. Due to the smoother background in comparison with defocus phase contrast cryo-electron tomography, Zernike phase contrast cryo-electron tomography could yield higher visibility for particulate or filamentous ultrastructure inside the cells, and allowed us to clearly recognize membrane protein structures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Crystallographic studies of IF protein fragments remain the main route to access their atomic structure. To enable crystallization, such fragments must be sufficiently short. As a consequence, they often fail to assemble into the correct CC dimers. In particular, human vimentin fragment D3 corresponding to the first half of coil2 (residues 261-335) stays monomeric in solution. We have induced its dimerization via introducing a disulfide link between two cysteines engineered in the hydrophobic core of the CC close to its N-terminus. The 2.3 Å crystal structure of the D3st (stabilized) fragment reveals a mostly parallel α-helical bundle structure in its N-terminal half which smoothly continues into a left-handed CC towards the C-terminus. This provides a direct evidence for a continuously α-helical structure of the coil2 segment and disproves the previously suggested existence of linker L2 separating it into two left-handed CCs. The general principles of CC dimer stabilization by disulfide introduction are also discussed.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Mammalian cells express up to three different EBs (EB1, EB2, and EB3). Besides forming homodimers, EB1 and EB3 also assemble into heterodimers. One group of EB-binding partners encompasses proteins that harbor CAP-Gly domains. The binding properties of the different EBs towards CAP-Gly proteins have not been systematically investigated. This information is, however, important to compare and contrast functional differences. Here we analyzed the interactions between CLIP-170 and p150(glued) CAP-Gly domains with the three EB homodimers and the EB1-EB3 heterodimer. Using isothermal titration calorimetry we observed that some EBs bind to the individual CAP-Gly domains with similar affinities while others interact with their targets with pronounced differences. We further found that the two types of CAP-Gly domains use alternative mechanisms to target the C-terminal domains of EBs. We succeeded to solve the crystal structure of a complex composed of a heterodimer of EB1 and EB3 C-termini together with the CAP-Gly domain of p150(glued).

 Abstract
 
 Nanoparticles show great promise as potent vaccine candidates since they are readily taken up by the antigen presenting cells of the immune system. The particle size and the density of the B cell epitopes on the surface of the particles greatly influences the strength of the humoral immune response. We have developed a novel type of nanoparticle composed of peptide building blocks (Raman et al., 2006) and have used such particles to design vaccines against malaria and SARS (Kaba et al., 2009; Pimentel et al., 2009). Here we investigate the biophysical properties and the refolding conditions of a prototype of these self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticles (SAPNs). SAPNs are formed from a peptide containing a pentameric and a trimeric coiled-coil domain. At near physiological conditions the peptide self-assembles into about 27nm, roughly spherical SAPNs. The average size of the SAPNs increases with the salt concentration. The optimal pH for their formation is between 7.5 and 8.5, while aggregation occurs at lower and higher values. A glycerol concentration of about 5% v/v is required for the formation of SAPNs with regular spherical shapes. These studies will help to optimize the immunological properties of SAPNs.

Here, we used capsids of the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus in combination with electron microscopy and discovered this capsid crosses the NPC and enters into the nucleus intact, where it releases its genome. To better illustrate the existence of this capsid through the NPC in its native conformation, we reconstructed the nuclear import event using electron tomography. In addition, using different experimental conditions, we were able to visualize the intact capsid interacting with NPC cytoplasmic filaments, as an initial docking site, and midway through the NPC.

Here we use an Arp2/3-complex dependent bead motility assay to study the effect of fascin both on its own and in the presence of VASP. The Young's modulus of phalloidin stabilized comets grown in the presence of fascin increased linearly with concentration above a 0.5 μM threshold. Inversely, the initial velocity of the comets decreased linearly with fascin concentration above the same threshold. Interestingly, VASP and fascin together increased the Young's modulus of the comets compared to those grown in the presence of only one of the two proteins. This effect was most remarkable at low concentration, below 0.5 and 0.15 μM for fascin and VASP, respectively.

Regulated splicing operates through the combinatorial interplay of positive and negative regulatory signals present in the pre-mRNA, which are recognized by trans-acting factors. All these RNA and protein components are assembled in a gigantic, 21 MDa, ribonucleoprotein splicing machine - the supraspliceosome. Because most alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms vary between different cell and tissue types, the ability to perform alternative splicing is expected to be an integral part of the supraspliceosome, which constitutes the splicing machine in vivo. Here we show that both the constitutively and alternatively spliced mRNAs of the endogenous human pol II transcripts: hnRNP A/B, survival of motor neuron (SMN) and ADAR2 are predominantly found in supraspliceosomes. This finding is consistent with our observations that the splicing regulators hnRNP G as well as all phosphorylated SR proteins are predominantly associated with supraspliceosomes. We further show that changes in alternative splicing of hnRNP A/B, affected by up regulation of SRSF5 (SRp40) or by treatment with C6-ceramide, occur within supraspliceosomes.

We examined the localization of the C- and N-terminal domain of Nup98 by immunogold-labeling using domain-specific antibodies against Nup98 and by expressing epitope tagged versions of Nup98. Our studies revealed that anchorage of Nup98 to NPCs through its C-terminal autoproteolytic domain occurs in the center of the NPC, whereas its N-terminal GLFG domain is more flexible and is detected at multiple locations within the NPC. Additionally, we have confirmed the central localization of Nup98 within the NPC using super resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SIM) to position Nup98 domains relative to markers of cytoplasmic filaments and the nuclear basket.

Conventional electron microscope observation of semi-thin cross sections (300nm thick) of high-pressure freeze fixed and resin embedded brush border has shown a whirling pattern in the center of the microvilli instead of hexagonally arranged dots, which strongly suggests that the bundle consists of a non-parallel array of filaments. A depth compensation method for the ET was developed to estimate the actual structure of the actin bundle. Specimen shrinkage by beam irradiation during image acquisition was estimated to be 63%, and we restored the original thickness in the reconstruction. The depth compensated tomogram displayed the individual actin filaments within the bundles and it indicated that the actin filaments do not lie exactly parallel to each other: instead, they are twisted in a clockwise coil with a pitch of ∼120°/μm. Furthermore, the lattice of actin filaments was occasionally re-arranged within the bundle. As the microvillar bundle mechanically interacts with the membrane and is thought to be compressed by the membrane's faint tensile force, we removed the shrouding membrane using detergents to eliminate the mechanical interaction.

Here we report a combined structural and spectroscopic characterization of a Trx isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsTrxA1). Thermal denaturation unveils that SsTrxA1 is endowed with a remarkable stability in the explored temperature range 50-105°C. The structure of the oxidized form of SsTrxA1 determined at 1.9Å resolution presents a number of peculiar features. Although the protein was crystallized in a slightly acid medium (pH 6.5) as many as ten intramolecular/intermolecular carboxyl-carboxylate interactions involving glutamic and aspartic acid side chains are found in three independent SsTrxA1 molecules present in the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly for a hyperthermostable protein, the structure of SsTrxA1 is characterized by the presence (a) of a very limited number of intramolecular salt bridges and (b) of a cavity nearby Cys52, a residue that is frequently a phenylananine in other members of the family. Chemical denaturation investigations carried out on SsTrxA1 and SsTrxA2 show that both proteins present a significant stability against guanidine hydrochloride, thus indicating that ionic interactions play a minor role in their stabilization. Compared to Trxs from mesophilic sources, SsTrxA1 displays a longer α-helix 1 and a shorter loop connecting this α-helix with β-strand 2. As these features are shared with Trxs isolated from thermophilic sources, the shortening of this loop may be a general strategy adopted to stabilize this fold. This feature may be exploited for the design of hyperthermostable Trx scaffolds.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, it is limited to thin specimens, <1.0 μm in thickness, typically restricted to the peripheral areas of intact eukaryotic cells. Analysis of tissue ultrastructure, on the other hand, requires physical sectioning approaches, preferably cryo-sectioning, following which electron tomography (ET) may be performed. Nevertheless, cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified sections is a demanding technique and typically cannot be used to examine thick sections, >80-100 nm, due to surface crevasses. Here, we explore the potential use of cryo-ET of vitrified frozen sections (VFSs) for imaging cell adhesions in chicken smooth muscle and mouse epithelial tissues. By investigating 300-400 nm thick sections, which are collected on the EM grid and re-vitrified, we resolved fine 3D structural details of the membrane-associated dense plaques and flanking caveoli in smooth muscle tissue, and desmosomal adhesions in stratified epithelium. Technically, this method offers a simple approach for reconstructing thick volumes of hydrated frozen sections.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Lamins are required for maintaining nuclear shape and are involved in most nuclear activities. Here, we studied the 3D organization of the nuclear lamina formed upon the expression of Caenorhabditis elegans lamin (Ce-lamin) within the nucleus of a Xenopus laevis oocyte. We show that Ce-lamin forms an intricate 3D meshwork of 5-6 nm lamin protofilaments. The diverse protofilament interactions and organization may shed light upon the unique mechano-elastic properties of the nuclear lamina scaffold supporting the nuclear envelope. The Q159K Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome-linked mutation alters interactions between protofilaments within the lamina, leading to the formation of more bundled arrays of less isotropically-oriented protofilaments.

When renatured individually from 8M urea into a low ionic strength/high pH-buffer, K8 was present in a dimeric to tetrameric form as revealed by analytical ultracentrifugation. In contrast, K18 sedimented as a monomer. When mixed in 8 M urea and renatured together, K8 and K18 exhibited s-value profiles compatible with homogeneous tetrameric complexes. This finding was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Subsequently, these tetrameric starter units were subjected to assembly experiments at various protein concentrations. At low values such as 0.0025 g/l, unit-length filaments were abundantly present after 2s of assembly. During the following 5 min, filaments grew rapidly and by measuring the length of individual filaments we were able to generate time-dependent length profiles. These data revealed that keratins K8/K18 assemble several times faster than vimentin and desmin. In addition, we determined the persistence length l(p) of K8/K18 filaments to be in the range of 300 nm. Addition of 1 mM MgCl(2) increases l(p) to 480 nm indicating that magnesium ions affect the interaction of keratin subunits within the filament during assembly to some extent.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In addition, we apply micromechanical modeling to further elucidate the individual influences of particular structural features, which might appear only in a superimposed manner in experiments. The test results confirm the dominant influences of the microfibril angle on the stiffness at cell wall level and of density at the macroscopic scale. Vessels and ray cells affect the macroscopic stiffness of the wood tissue not only through their content, but also through their arrangement and shape: A ring-porous structure results in comparably higher longitudinal but lower radial stiffness than a diffuse-porous one. As for ray cells, large and particularly compactly shaped bundles might reduce the stiffness in tangential direction because of the fiber deviations they cause.

To test the usefulness of the method in refining atomic structures within cryoEM density we incorporated it into our flexible fitting protocol (Flex-EM). Our benchmark includes 13 pairs of protein structures in two conformations each, one of which is represented by a corresponding cryoEM map. Refining the structures in simulated and experimental maps at the 5-15Å resolution range using rigid bodies identified by RIBFIND shows a significant improvement over using individual SSEs as rigid bodies. For the 15Å resolution simulated maps, using RIBFIND-based rigid bodies improves the initial fits by 40.64% on average, as compared to 26.52% when using individual SSEs. Furthermore, for some test cases we show that at the sub-nanometer resolution range the fits can be further improved by applying a two-stage refinement protocol (using RIBFIND-based refinement followed by an SSE-based refinement).

Missense mutations in the human lamins A/C cause a family of laminopathic diseases, with no known mechanistic link between the position of the mutation and the resulting disease phenotypes. The Caenorhabditis elegans lamin (Ce-lamin) is structurally and functionally homologous to human lamins, and recent advances have allowed detailed structural analysis of Ce-lamin filaments both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we studied the effect of laminopathic mutations on Ce-lamin filament assembly in vitro and the corresponding physiological phenotypes in animals. We focused on three disease-linked mutations, Q159K, T164P, and L535P, which have previously been shown to affect lamin structure and nuclear localization. Mutations prevented the proper assembly of Ce-lamin into filament and/or paracrystalline arrays. Disease-like phenotypes were observed in strains expressing low levels of these mutant lamins, including decreased fertility and motility coincident with muscle lesions. In addition, the Q159K- and T164P-expressing strains showed a reduced lifespan. Thus, different disease-linked mutations in Ce-lamin exhibit major effects in vivo and in vitro. Using C. elegans as a model system, a comprehensive analysis of the effects of specific lamin mutations from the level of in vitro filament assembly to the physiology of the organism will help uncover the mechanistic differences between these different lamin mutations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

While isolated macromolecular specimens are typically composed of only very few different components that may be recognized by their shape, size or state of polymerization, cellular specimens combine large numbers of proteinaceous structures as well as nucleic acids and lipid arrays. Consequently, an unambiguous identification of these structures within the context of a whole cell may create a very difficult challenge. On plastic-embedded specimens, or Tokuyasu sections (Tokuyasu, 1980), epitopes that are exposed at the surface can be tagged by antibodies. However, vitrified sections have to be kept at strict cryo-conditions (below -140 °C) and therefore do not allow any post-sectioning treatment of the specimens other than data acquisition in the microscope. Hence, the labels have to be placed into the specimen before freezing. Here we report on the application of a small metal-clustering protein, metallothionein (MTH), as a clonable label capable of clustering metal atoms into a high-density particle with high spatial resolution.

The bacterial enzymes are hexamers and each polypeptide consists of an N-terminal substrate-binding (Domain I) followed by a C-terminal cofactor-binding segment (Domain II). The reaction takes place at the junction of the two domains, which move as rigid bodies and are presumed to narrow the cleft during catalysis. Distinct signature sequences in the nucleotide-binding domain have been linked to NAD(+) vs. NADP(+) specificity, but they are not unambiguous predictors of cofactor preferences. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of NAD(+)-specific Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus glutamate dehydrogenase in the apo state. The poor quality of native crystals was resolved by derivatization with selenomethionine, and the structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The structure reveals an open catalytic cleft in the absence of substrate and cofactor. Modeling of NAD(+) in Domain II suggests that a hydrophobic pocket and polar residues contribute to nucleotide specificity. Mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry studies of a critical glutamate at the P7 position of the core fingerprint confirms its role in NAD(+) binding. Finally, the cofactor binding site is compared with bacterial and mammalian enzymes to understand how the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures may distinguish between NAD(+) vs. NADP(+) recognition.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Previously, the epitopes of seven murine monoclonal antibodies have been identified by cryo-EM analysis of Fab-labeled capsids. All but one are conformational and all but one map around the spike tip. The exception, which is also the tightest-binder, straddles an inter-molecular interface on the floor. Seeking to relate these observations to the immunological response of infected humans, we isolated anti-cAg antibodies from a patient, prepared Fabs, and analyzed their binding to capsids. A priori, one possibility was that many different Fabs would give an undifferentiated continuum of Fab-related density. In fact, the density observed was highly differentiated and could be reproduced by modeling with just five Fabs, three binding to the spike and two to the floor. These results show that epitopes on the floor, far (~30 Å) from the immunodominant loop, are clinically relevant and that murine anti-cAg antibodies afford a good model for the human system.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The lack of a fluorescent actin probe has prevented a detailed study of actin filament dynamics in contractile rings, and left open questions regarding the mechanism of cytokinesis. To incorporate fluorescent actin into the contractile ring to study its dynamics, we introduced the coding sequence for a tetracysteine motif (FLNCCPGCCMEP) at 10 locations in the fission yeast actin gene and expressed the mutant proteins from the native actin locus in diploid cells with wild-type actin on the other chromosome. We labeled these tagged actins inside live cells with the FlAsH reagent. Cells incorporated some of these labeled actins into actin patches at sites of endocytosis, where Arp2/3 complex nucleates all of the actin filaments. However, the cells did not incorporate any of the FlAsH-actins into the contractile ring.

Low defocus imaging provides high resolution at low contrast, while high defocus imaging yields high contrast at the price of limited resolution. Quantitative assessment of the quality of lipid bilayer reconstructions in the resulting tomograms demonstrates stable resolution preservation beyond 3 nm for cells thicker than 500 nm.

Denaturation enthalpy ΔH(D) in water was found to be independent of heating rate (11.5J/g) and to be approximately double as high as in the dry state (5.2J/g). The lower enthalpy (dry) and its dependency on heating rate are attributed to effects of pyrolysis. The stepwise change of reversing heat capacity ΔC(p) marks the denaturation process as a classic two-stage transition. The increase of ΔC(p) with heating rate reflects a continuous shift of the nature of the denaturation of the α-helical material, first, into random coil and then towards random β-materials for lower heating rates. Denaturation temperatures follow Arrhenius relationships with heating rate, yielding activation energies of 416kJ/mol (dry) and 263kJ/mol (wet), respectively. A decrease of activation energy (wet) for high heating rates supports the hypothesis of systematic changes of the pathway of denaturation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Although less accurate than experimental observations, computational predictions can be sufficiently accurate to prompt functional hypotheses and guide experiments, e.g. to identify individual amino acid or nucleotide residues.

Recent years have seen an increase in structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by fitting a high-resolution structure into its low-resolution cryo-EM map. A commonly used protocol for accommodating the conformational changes between the X-ray structure and the cryo-EM map is rigid body fitting of individual domains. With the emergence of different flexible fitting approaches, there is a need to compare and revise these different protocols for the fitting. We have applied three diverse automated flexible fitting approaches on a protein dataset for which rigid domain fitting (RDF) models have been deposited in the PDB. In general, a consensus is observed in the conformations, which indicates a convergence from these theoretically different approaches to the most probable solution corresponding to the cryo-EM map. However, the result shows that the convergence might not be observed for proteins with complex conformational changes or with missing densities in cryo-EM map. In contrast, RDF structures deposited in the PDB can represent conformations that not only differ from the consensus obtained by flexible fitting but also from X-ray crystallography. Thus, this study emphasizes that a ""consensus"" achieved by the use of several automated flexible fitting approaches can provide a higher level of confidence in the modeled configurations. Following this protocol not only increases the confidence level of fitting, but also highlights protein regions with uncertain fitting.

Malfunctioning results in a number of abnormalities, diseases (ciliopathies) and certain types of cancer. Morphological and biochemical knowledge on cilia/flagella, (early) ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport is often obtained from model systems (e.g. Chlamydomonas) or from multi ciliary cells like lung or kidney epithelium. In this study endothelial cells in isolated human umbilical veins (HUVs) and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are compared and used to study primary ciliogenesis. By combining fluorescence microscopy, SEM, 2D and 3D TEM techniques we found that under the tested culturing conditions 60% of cobblestone endothelial cells form a primary cilium. Only a few of these cilia are present (protruding) on the endothelial cell surface, meaning that most primary cilia are in the cytoplasm (non-protruding). This was also observed in situ in the endothelial cells in the umbilical vein. The exact function(s?) of these non-protruding cilia remains unclear. Ultra-structural analysis of cultured HUVECs and the endothelial layer of the human umbilical veins reveal that there are: vesicles inside the ciliary pocket during the early stages of ciliogenesis; tubules/vesicles from the cytoplasm fuse with the ciliary sheath; irregular axoneme patterns, and two round, membranous vesicles inside the basal body. We conclude that cobblestone cultured HUVECs are comparable to the in vivo epithelial lining of the umbilical veins and therefore provide a well defined, relatively simple human model system with a reproducible number of non-protruding primary cilia for studying ciliogenesis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In the terraced nacre of bivalves bridges associated with elongated gaps in the interlamellar membrane (>100nm) have mainly been found at or close to the edges of superposed parental tablets. To explain this placement, we hypothesize that the interlamellar membrane breaks due to differences in osmotic pressure across it when the interlamellar space below becomes reduced at an advanced stage of calcification.

This unconventional arrangement of two actin molecules in an antiparallel orientation can be detected by chemical crosslinking at the onset of polymerization in vitro. Moreover, evidence for a transient incorporation of LD into growing filaments and its ability to inhibit nucleation of F-actin filament assembly implicate that the LD pathway contributes to supramolecular actin patterning.

For the first time using atomic force microscopy (AFM) we have been able to image the interaction of eEF1A with actin and the subsequent bundling of actin in vitro. Interestingly, we found that eEF1A dramatically increases the rate of polymerisation (45-fold above control levels). We also show for the first time that H2A-H2B has remarkably similar effects upon actin bundling (relative bundle size/number) and polymerisation (35-fold increase above control levels) as eEF1a. The presence of lysozyme resulted in bundles which were distinct from those formed due to eEF1A and H2A-H2B. Lysozyme also increased the rate of actin polymerisation above the control level (by 10-fold). Given the striking similarities between the actin bundling and polymerisation properties of eEF1A and H2A-H2B, our results hint that dimerisation and electrostatic binding may provide clues to the mechanism through which eEF1A-actin bundling occurs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This can be a particular problem in two-dimensional (2-D) crystallization for electron cryomicroscopy since individual crystals are too small for compositional analysis. Using a broad 'sparse matrix' of buffer conditions typically used in 2-D crystallization, we have identified at least eight unique crystal forms of AcrB. Reference to images and projection maps of these different forms can greatly facilitate the early identification of false leads in 2-D crystallization trials of other membrane proteins of interest. We illustrate the usefulness of such data by highlighting two studies of membrane proteins in our laboratories. We show in one case (a bacterial sodium channel, NaChBac) how early crystallization 'hits' could be attributed to contaminating AcrB by comparison against our AcrB crystal image database. In a second case, involving a member of the monovalent cation/proton antiporter-1 family (MPSIL0171), a comparison with the observed AcrB crystal forms allowed easy identification of reconstituted AcrB particles, greatly facilitating the eventual purification and crystallization of the correct protein in pure form as ordered helical arrays. Our database of AcrB crystal images will be of general use in assisting future 2-D crystallization studies of other membrane proteins.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

As the intraerythrocytic parasite develops it increases in size and alters the permeability of the host cell plasma membrane. An intriguing question is: how is the integrity of the host erythrocyte maintained during the intraerythrocytic cycle? We have used water window cryo X-ray tomography to determine cell morphology and hemoglobin content at different stages of asexual and sexual differentiation. The cryo stabilization preserves native structure permitting accurate analyses of parasite and host cell volumes. Absorption of soft X-rays by protein adheres to Beer-Lambert's law permitting quantitation of the concentration of hemoglobin in the host cell compartment. During asexual development the volume of the parasite reaches about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume but the infected erythrocyte volume remains relatively constant. The total hemoglobin content gradually decreases during the 48h cycle but its concentration remains constant until early trophozoite stage, decreases by 25%, then remains constant again until just prior to rupture. During early sexual development the gametocyte has a similar morphology to a trophozoite but then undergoes a dramatic shape change. Our cryo X-ray tomography analysis reveals that about 70% of the host cell hemoglobin is taken up and digested during gametocyte development and the parasite eventually occupies about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume. The total volume of the infected erythrocyte remains constant, apart from some reversible shrinkage at stage IV, while the concentration of hemoglobin decreases to about 70% of that in an uninfected erythrocyte.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

They play an important role in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation and DNA damage repair. RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 are overexpressed in different types of cancer and interact with major oncogenic factors, such as β-catenin and c-Myc regulating their function. We solved the first three-dimensional crystal structure of the human RuvBL complex with a truncated domain II and show that this complex is competent for helicase activity. The structure reveals a dodecamer consisting of two heterohexameric rings with alternating RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 monomers bound to ADP/ATP, that interact with each other via the retained part of domain II. The dodecameric quaternary structure of the R1ΔDII/R2ΔDII complex observed in the crystal structure was confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering analysis. Interestingly, truncation of domain II led to a substantial increase in ATP consumption of RuvBL1, RuvBL2 and their complex. In addition, we present evidence that DNA unwinding of the human RuvBL proteins can be auto-inhibited by domain II, which is not present in the homologous bacterial helicase RuvB. Our data give new insights into the molecular arrangement of RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 and strongly suggest that in vivo activities of these highly interesting therapeutic drug targets are regulated by cofactors inducing conformational changes via domain II in order to modulate the enzyme complex into its active state.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

GluK3 is a subunit of iGluRs, belonging to the subfamily of kainate receptors (GluK1-5). Several crystal structures of GluK1 and GluK2 ligand binding domains have been determined in complex with agonists and antagonists. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying GluK3 ligand binding properties and no compounds displaying reasonable selectivity towards GluK3 are available today. Here, we present the first X-ray crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of GluK3 in complex with glutamate, determined to 1.6Å resolution. The structure reveals a conserved glutamate binding mode, characteristic for iGluRs, and a water molecule network in the glutamate binding site similar to that seen in GluK1. In GluK3, a slightly lower degree of domain closure around glutamate is observed compared to most other kainate receptor structures with glutamate. The volume of the GluK3 glutamate binding cavity was found to be of intermediate size between those of GluK1 and GluK2. The residues in GluK3 contributing to the subfamily differences in the binding sites are primarily: Thr520, Ala691, Asn722, Leu736 and Thr742.

Cys106 is central to this function since it has a distinctly low pK(a) rendering it extremely susceptible for oxidation. This characteristic, however, also poses a severe hindrance to obtain reduced DJ-1 for in vitro investigation. We have developed an approach to produce recombinant human DJ-1 in its reduced form as a bona fide basis for exploring the redox capacities of the protein. We solved the crystal structure of this DJ-1 at 1.56Å resolution, allowing us to capture Cys106 in the reduced state for the first time. The dimeric structure reveals one molecule of DJ-1 in its reduced state while the other exhibits the characteristics of a mono-oxygenated cysteine. Comparison with previous structures indicates the absence of redox dependent global conformational changes in DJ-1. The capture of reduced Cys106 is facilitated by stabilization within the putative active site achieved through a glutamate side chain. This side chain is provided by a crystallographic neighbor as part of a 'Leu-Glu' motif, which was added to the C-terminus of DJ-1. In the structure this motif binds DJ-1 in close proximity to Cys106 through extended hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions depicting a distinct binding pocket, which can serve as a basis for compound development targeting DJ-1.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) further demonstrated that submicronic grains are assembled into crystallographically coherent clusters or fibers, the latter are even laterally associated into single-crystal bundles. A model of crystallization propagation through amorphous submicronic granular units is proposed to explain the formation of coherent micron-scale structural units. Finally, XRD and EELS analyses highlighted, respectively, inter-individual variation of skeletal Mg contents and heterogeneous spatial distribution of Ca ions in skeletal fibers. All mineralogical features presented here cannot be explained by classical inorganic crystallization principles in super-saturated solutions, but rather underlined a highly biologically regulated formation of the basal skeleton.

The ability to sequester Sr in the presence of an excess of Ca is of considerable interest for the remediation of (90)Sr from the environment and nuclear waste. While most cells dynamically regulate the concentration of the second messenger Ca(2+) in the cytosol and various organelles, transport proteins rarely discriminate strongly between Ca, Sr, and Ba. Herein, we investigate how these ions are trafficked in C. moniliferum and how precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO(4) crystals occurs in the terminal vacuoles. Towards this goal, we simultaneously visualize intracellular dynamics of multiple elements using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) of cryo-fixed/freeze-dried samples. We correlate the resulting elemental maps with ultrastructural information gleaned from freeze-fracture cryo-SEM of frozen-hydrated cells and use micro X-ray absorption near edge structure (micro-XANES) to determine sulfur speciation.

Most vertebrate animals, including humans, possess two homologs of this enzyme (UPP1 & UPP2), of which UPP1 has been more thoroughly studied and is better characterized. Here, we report two crystallographic structures of human UPP2 (hUPP2) in distinctly active and inactive conformations. These structures reveal that a conditional intramolecular disulfide bridge can form within the protein that dislocates a critical phosphate-coordinating arginine residue (R100) away from the active site, disabling the enzyme. In vitro activity measurements on both recombinant hUPP2 and native mouse UPP2 confirm the redox sensitivity of this enzyme, in contrast to UPP1. Sequence analysis shows that this feature is conserved among UPP2 homologs and lacking in all UPP1 proteins due to the absence of a necessary cysteine residue. The state of the disulfide bridge has further structural consequences for one face of the enzyme that suggest UPP2 may have additional functions in sensing and initiating cellular responses to oxidative stress. The molecular details surrounding these dynamic aspects of hUPP2 structure and regulation provide new insights as to how novel inhibitors of this protein may be developed with improved specificity and affinity.

The crystal structure of PfFabZ is available in hexameric (active) and dimeric (inactive) forms. However, PfFabZ has not been crystallized with any bound inhibitors until now. We have designed a new condition to crystallize PfFabZ with its inhibitors bound in the active site, and determined the crystal structures of four of these complexes. This is the first report on any FabZ enzyme with active site inhibitors that interact directly with the catalytic residues. Inhibitor binding not only stabilized the substrate binding loop but also revealed that the substrate binding tunnel has an overall shape of ""U"". In the crystal structures, residue Phe169 located in the middle of the tunnel was found to be in two different conformations, open and closed. Thus, Phe169, merely by changing its side chain conformation, appears to be controlling the length of the tunnel to make it suitable for accommodating longer substrates. The volume of the substrate binding tunnel is determined by the sequence as well as by the conformation of the substrate binding loop region and varies between organisms for accommodating fatty acids of different chain lengths. This report on the crystal structures of the complexes of PfFabZ provides the structural basis of the inhibitory mechanism of the enzyme that could be used to improve the potency of inhibitors against an important component of fatty acid synthesis common to many infectious organisms.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

But how applicable is the folding of such models to β-structure in larger proteins with conventional hydrophobic cores? Here we present multiple unfolding simulations of three such proteins that contain the WW domain double hairpin β-sheet motif: cold shock protein A (CspA), cold shock protein B (CspB) and glucose permease IIA domain. We compare the behavior of the free motif in solution and in the context of proteins of different size and architecture. Both Csp proteins lost contacts between the double-hairpin motif and the protein core as the first step of unfolding and proceeded to unfold with loss of the third β-strand, similar to the isolated WW domain. The glucose permease IIA domain is a larger protein and the contacts between the motif and the core were not lost as quickly. Instead the unfolding pathway of glucose permease IIA followed a different pathway with β1 pulling away from the sheet first. Interestingly, when the double hairpin motif was excised from the glucose permease IIA domain and simulated in isolation in water it unfolded by the same pathway as the WW domain, indicating that it is tertiary interactions with the protein that alter the motif's unfolding not a sequence dependent effect on its intrinsic unfolding behavior. With respect to the unfolding of the hairpins, there was no consistent order to the loss of hydrogen bonds between the β-strands in the hairpins in any of the systems. Our results show that while the folding behavior of the isolated WW domain is generally consistent with the double hairpin motif's behavior in the cold shock proteins, it is not the case for the glucose permease IIA domain. So, one must be cautious in extrapolating findings from model systems to larger more complicated proteins where tertiary interactions can overwhelm intrinsic behavior.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl) methanesulfonamide (NS-398) was the first in a series of isoform-selective drugs designed to preferentially inhibit COX-2, with the aim of ameliorating many of the toxic gastrointestinal side effects caused by conventional NSAID inhibition. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of murine COX-2 in complex with NS-398 utilizing synchrotron radiation to 3.0A resolution. NS-398 binds in the cyclooxygenase channel in a conformation that is different than that observed for other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as celecoxib, with no discernible penetration into the side pocket formed in COX-2 by the isoform-specific substitutions of I434V, H513R, and I523V. Instead, the methanesulfonamide moiety of NS-398 interacts with the side chain of Arg-120 at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel, similar to that observed for acidic, nonselective NSAIDs such as indomethacin and flurbiprofen.

To investigate the precise roles of Mmp-20 and its influence on the assembly of amelogenin, an in vitro enzymatic digestion process mimicking the initial stages of amelogenin proteolysis was investigated at near-physiological conditions using recombinant porcine amelogenin (rP172) and enamelysin. Hierarchically organized nanorod structures formed during different digestion stages were detected by TEM. At the earliest stage, uniformly dispersed parent amelogenin spherical particles, mixed with some darker stained smaller spheres, and accompanying elongated chain-like nanostructures were observed. Cylindrical nanorods, which appeared to be the result of tight assembly of thin subunit cylindrical discs with thicknesses ranging from ∼2.5 to ∼6.0nm, were formed after an hour of proteolysis. These subunit building blocks stacked to form nanorods with maximum length of ∼100nm. With the production of more cleavage products, additional morphologies spontaneously evolved from the cylindrical nanorods. Larger ball-like aggregates ultimately formed at the end of proteolysis. The uniform spherical particles, nanorods, morphological patterns evolved from nanorods, and globular aggregated microstructures were successively formed by means of co-assembly of amelogenin and its cleavage products during a comparatively slow proteolysis process. We propose that, following the C-terminal cleavage of amelogenin, co-assembly with its fragments leads to formation of nanorod structures whose properties eventually dictate the super-structural organization of enamel matrix, controlling the elongated growth of enamel apatite crystals.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Until now, very limited information is available concerning the molecular dynamics of DNMTs. The natural product nanaomycin A is the first selective inhibitor of DNMT3B that induce genomic demethylation. Herein we report long (>100ns) molecular dynamics simulations for human DNMT3B bound to nanaomycin A with and without the presence of the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM).

Key interactions of nanaomycin A with DNMT3B involve long lasting interactions with Arg731, Arg733, Arg832, and the catalytic Cys651. Results further support the previous hypothesis that nanaomycin A has key interactions with amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of methylation.

In 1μm thick sections of near-pulp root dentin, where peritubular dentin (PTD) is newly forming, high concentrations of Zn, relative to those in intertubular dentin (ITD), were observed adjacent to and surrounding the tubule lumens. Some but not all tubules exhibited hypercalcified collars (high Ca signal relative to the surrounding ITD), and, when present, the zone of high Ca did not extend around the tubule. Diffraction rings from cAp 00.2 and 11.2+21.1+30.0 reflections were observed, and cAp was the only crystal phase detected. Profiles of Ca, Zn and cAp diffracted intensities showed the same transitions from solid to tubule lumen, indicating the same cAp content and organization in ITD far from the tubules and adjacent to them. Further, the matching Ca and diffraction profiles demonstrated that all of the Ca is in cAp or that any noncrystalline Ca was uniformly distributed throughout the dentin. Variation of 00.2 and 11.2+21.1+30.0 diffracted intensity was consistent with the expected biaxial crystallographic texture.

There was no significant difference in the Young's modulus between the three groups (p > 0.05), but the knockout mice had a significantly (p < 0.05) lower relaxation ratio than the wild type mice.

Although +TIPs mark only phases of MT growth, the plusTipTracker software allows inference of additional MT dynamics, including phases of pause and shrinkage, by linking collinear, sequential growth tracks. The algorithm underlying the reconstruction of full MT trajectories relies on the spatially and temporally global tracking framework described in Jaqaman et al. (2008). Post-processing of track populations yields a wealth of quantitative phenotypic information about MT network architecture that can be explored using several visualization modalities and bioinformatics tools included in plusTipTracker. Graphical user interfaces enable novice Matlab users to track thousands of MTs in minutes. In this paper, we describe the algorithms used by plusTipTracker and show how the package can be used to study regional differences in the relative proportion of MT subpopulations within a single cell. The strategy of grouping +TIP growth tracks for the analysis of MT dynamics has been introduced before (Matov et al., 2010). The numerical methods and analytical functionality incorporated in plusTipTracker substantially advance this previous work in terms of flexibility and robustness.

Among the characterized ADF/cofilin proteins, TgADF has the shortest length and is missing a C-terminal helix implicated in F-actin binding. In order to understand its characteristic properties, we have determined the solution structure of TgADF and studied its backbone dynamics from ¹⁵N-relaxation measurements. TgADF has conserved ADF/cofilin fold consisting of a central mixed β-sheet comprised of six β-strands that are partially surrounded by three α-helices and a C-terminal helical turn. The high G-actin sequestering activity of TgADF relies on highly structurally and dynamically optimized interactions between G-actin and G-actin binding surface of TgADF. The equilibrium dissociation constant for TgADF and rabbit muscle G-actin was 23.81 nM, as measured by ITC, which reflects very strong affinity of TgADF and G-actin interactions. The F-actin binding site of TgADF is partially formed, with a shortened F-loop that does not project out of the ellipsoid structure and a C-terminal helical turn in place of the C-terminal helix α4. Yet, it is more rigid than the F-actin binding site of Leishmania donovani cofilin. Experimental observations and structural features do not support the interaction of PIP2 with TgADF, and PIP2 does not affect the interaction of TgADF with G-actin. Overall, this study suggests that conformational flexibility of G-actin binding sites enhances the affinity of TgADF for G-actin, while conformational rigidity of F-actin binding sites of conventional ADF/cofilins is necessary for stable binding to F-actin.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The transcription factor NF-κB and consequently IKK-β are central to signal transduction pathways of mammalian cells. The purpose of this research was to develop a 3D structural model of the IKK-β kinase domain with its ATP cofactor and investigate its dynamics and ligand binding potential. Through a combination of comparative modelling and simulated heating/annealing molecular dynamics (SAMD) simulation in explicit water the model accuracy could be substantially improved compared to comparative modelling on its own as shown by model validation measures. The structure revealed the details of ATP/Mg(2+) binding indicating hydrophobic interactions with the adenine base and a significant contribution of Mg(2+) as a bridge between ATP phosphate groups and negatively charged side chains. The molecular dynamics trajectories of the ATP-bound and free enzyme showed two conformations in each case, which contributed to the majority of the trajectory. The ATP-free enzyme revealed a novel binding site distant from the ATP binding site that was not encountered in the ATP bound enzyme. Based on the overall structural flexibility, it is suggested that a truncated version of the kinase domain from Ala14 to Leu265 should be subjected to crystallisation trials. The 3D structure of this enzyme will enable rational design of new ligands and analysis of protein-protein interactions.

Growing spines were labeled twice (for 72 and 24 h, respectively) by increasing the abundance of ²⁶Mg in seawater. The incorporation of ²⁶Mg into the growing spines was subsequently imaged with the NanoSIMS ion microprobe. Stereom trabeculae initially grow as conical micro-spines, which form within less than 1 day. These micro-spines fuse together by lateral outgrowths and form a thin, open meshwork (inner stereom), which is subsequently reinforced by addition of layered thickening deposits (outer stereom). The (longitudinal) growth rate of the inner stereom is ca. 125 μm/day. A single (ca. 1 μm) thickening layer in the stereom trabeculae is deposited during 24h. The thickening process is contemporaneous with the formation micro-spines and involves both longitudinal trabeculae and transverse bridges to a similar degree. Furthermore, the skeleton-forming cells remain active in the previously formed open stereom for at least 10 days, and do not migrate upwards until the end of the thickening process.

In order to quantify the degree of structural changes, two characteristic patterns were extracted from the EM images. One is the winding pattern of the filament shape (WP) reflecting flexibility of the filament, and the other is the surface pattern of the filament (SP) reflecting intra-molecular domain-mobility of actin monomers constituting the filament. EM images were processed by morphological filtering followed by box-counting to calculate the fractal dimensions for WP (D(WP)) and SP (D(SP)). The result indicates that D(WP) was larger than D(SP) irrespective of the state of the filament (myosin-free or bound) and that both parameters for myosin-bound filaments were significantly larger than those for myosin-free filaments. Overall, this work provides the first quantitative insight into how conformational disorder of actin monomers is correlated with the myosin-induced increase in flexibility of actin filaments along their length as suggested by earlier studies with different techniques.

This study reports a novel experimental approach combining macroscopic mechanical loading of tendon with a morphometric ultrascale assessment of longitudinal and cross-sectional collagen fibril deformations. An atomic force microscope was used to characterize diameters and periodic banding (D-period) of individual type-I collagen fibrils within murine Achilles tendons that were loaded to 0%, 5%, or 10% macroscopic nominal strain, respectively. D-period banding of the collagen fibrils increased with increasing tendon strain (2.1% increase at 10% applied tendon strain, p<0.05), while fibril diameter decreased (8% reduction, p<0.05). No statistically significant differences between 0% and 5% applied strain were observed, indicating that the onset of fibril (D-period) straining lagged macroscopically applied tendon strains by at least 5%. This confirms previous reports of delayed onset of collagen fibril stretching and the role of collagen fibril kinematics in supporting physiological tendon loads. Fibril strains within the tissue were relatively tightly distributed in unloaded and highly strained tendons, but were more broadly distributed at 5% applied strain, indicating progressive recruitment of collagen fibrils. Using these techniques we also confirmed that collagen fibrils thin appreciably at higher levels of macroscopic tendon strain. Finally, in contrast to prevalent tendon structure-function concepts data revealed that loading of the collagen network is fairly homogenous, with no apparent predisposition for loading of collagen fibrils according to their diameter.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Multiple {110} twins are common both in the granular and columnar layers. The crystallite c-axis is parallel to the columns and is inclined at angles 0-50° from the lamellar normal (dispersing among individual lamellae), toward the shell growth direction.

Frequently, maps of complexes from cryo-EM are obtained at resolutions between 10 and 25Å. To aid in the interpretation of these medium- to low-resolution maps, they may be subdivided into three-dimensional segments representing subunits or subcomplexes. This division is often accomplished using a manual segmentation approach. While extremely useful, manual segmentation is subjective. We have developed a novel semi-interactive segmentation algorithm that can incorporate prior knowledge of subunit composition or structure without biasing the boundaries between subunits or subcomplexes. This algorithm has been characterized with experimental and simulated cryo-EM density maps at resolutions between 10 and 25Å.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However, estimation of the resolution-dependent (""spectral"") signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) from the input data has remained problematic, and error reduction due to specific application of the SSNR term within a Wiener filter has not been reported. Here we describe an adjustment to the Wiener filter for optimal summation of images of isolated particles surrounded by large regions of featureless background, as is typically the case in single-particle cryo-EM applications. We show that the density within the particle area can be optimized, in the least-squares sense, by scaling the SSNR term found in the conventional Wiener filter by a factor that reflects the fraction of the image field occupied by the particle. We also give related expressions that allow the SSNR to be computed for application in this new filter, by incorporating a masking step into a Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), a standard resolution measure. Furthermore, we show that this masked FRC estimation scheme substantially improves on the accuracy of conventional SSNR estimation methods. We demonstrate the validity of our new approach in numeric tests with simulated data corresponding to realistic cryo-EM imaging conditions. This variation of the Wiener filter and accompanying derivation should prove useful for a variety of single-particle cryo-EM applications, including 3D reconstruction.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In the absence of Lpx1, yeast peroxisomes show an aberrant vacuolated morphology similar to what is found in peroxisomal disorder patients. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lpx1 determined at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The structure reveals the complete catalytic triad with an unusual location of the acid residue after strand β6 of the canonical α/β-hydrolase fold. A four-helix cap domain covers the active site. The interface between the α/β-hydrolase core and the cap domain forms the potential substrate binding site, which may also comprise the tunnel that leads into the protein interior and widens into a cavity. Two further tunnels connect the active site to the protein surface, potentially facilitating substrate access. Lpx1 is a homodimer. The α/β-hydrolase core folds of the two protomers form the dimer contact site. Further dimerization contacts arise from the mutual embracement of the cap domain of one protomer by the non-canonical C-terminal helix of the other, resulting in a total buried surface area of some 6000 Å². The unusual C-terminal helix sticks out from the core fold to which it is connected by an extended flexible loop. We analyzed whether this helix is required for dimerization and for import of the dimer into peroxisomes using biochemical assays in vitro and a microscopy-based interaction assay in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, the C-terminal helix is dispensable for dimerization and dimer import. The unusually robust self-interaction suggests that Lpx1 is imported into peroxisomes as dimer.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous studies to investigate the folding and stability of hairpin did not monitor the end-to-end distance of the molecule. To directly probe the distance change, rhodamine dye was conjugated to the gp41 recombinant near the N- and C-terminal regions to detect the UV absorption and fluorescence intensity changes induced by the chemical denaturant guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Using the singly- and doubly-labeled constructs allowed us to distinguish between the hairpin formation and protein oligomerization. A biphasic transition of helical structure for the wild type protein was revealed by circular dichroism measurements while unfolding of the hairpin occurred at 6M GdmCl. The relevance of our study to the fusion inhibitor for HIV-1 was borne out by results on the mutants at the positions within the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions. A monophasic transition at lower denaturant concentration was detected for the NHR mutant supporting the concept of differential stability of NHR and CHR helical structure. The conclusion that the observed unstacking of doubly-labeled variant arises principally from the intra-molecular dimers was drawn from the unstacking of the protein labeled in the loop. Remarkably, it is deduced that the hairpin is more stable than the CHR helical structure. A model for denaturation of the helix hairpin bundle was proposed from these results. The biological implications of the findings and further applications of the distance-based approach were discussed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This study aims to describe the structure, architecture and mechanical properties of the canine baculum. To this end canine bacula from castrated and uncastrated dogs were collected and examined by light microscopy, micro-computed tomography (microCT) scanning, histological staining, and mechanical testing. Their mineral density and mechanical properties were compared with those of a typical skeletal bone (the radius) in the same dog. Furthermore, a numerical model of a representative baculum was created and its mechanical performance analyzed using the finite element method, in order to try to elucidate its function. Examination of light microscopy images of transverse sections shows that the baculum consists of a typical sandwich structure, with two cortical plates separated, and joined, by loose cancellous bone. MicroCT scans reveal that the mineral density is lower in the baculum than in the radius, both in castrated as well as in uncastrated dogs, resulting in much lower stiffness. Castration was found to decrease the mineral density in both the baculum and the radius. The most likely function of the baculum of the dog is to stiffen the penis to assist intromission, and its much lower mineral density compared to that of the radius may be a mechanism designed to decrease the stiffness somewhat, and thus reduce the risk of fracture during copulation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Growth speed and material properties of this tissue are truly remarkable, making it an interesting model for bone regeneration. Surprisingly, not much is known about the ultrastructure of the calcified tissues and the temporal sequence of their development during antler growth. We use a combination of imaging tools based on light and electron microscopy to characterize antler tissue at various stages of development. We observe that mineralized cartilage is first transformed into a bone framework with low degree of collagen fibril ordering at the micron level. This framework has a honeycomb-like appearance with the cylindrical pores oriented along the main antler axis. Later, this tissue is filled with primary osteons, whose collagen fibrils are mainly oriented along the pores, thus improving the antler's mechanical properties. This strongly suggests that to achieve very fast organ growth it is advantageous to have a longitudinal porous framework as an intermediate step in bone formation. The example of antler shows that geometric features of this framework are crucial, and a tubular geometry with a diameter in the order of hundred micrometers seems to be a good solution for fast framework-mediated bone formation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

However most of existing reconstruction methods are not suitable for extremely noisy and incomplete data conditions. We present an adaptive simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (ASART) in which a modified multilevel access scheme and an adaptive relaxation parameter adjustment method are developed to improve the quality of the reconstructed 3D structure. The reconstruction process is facilitated by using a column-sum substitution approach. This modified multilevel access scheme is adopted to arrange the order of projections so as to minimize the correlations between consecutive views within a limited angle range. In the adaptive relaxation parameter adjustment method, not only the weight matrix (as in the existing methods) but the gray levels of the pixels are employed to adjust the relaxation parameters so that the quality of the reconstruction is improved while the convergence process of the reconstruction is accelerated. In the column-sum substitution approach, the computation to obtain the reciprocal of the sum for the columns in each view is avoided so that the needed computations for each iteration can be reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed technique ASART is better based on objective quality measures than other methods, especially when data is noisy and limited in tilt angles. At the same time, the reconstruction by ASART outperforms that of simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) in speed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To this end, active site residues in human (h) DHFR were replaced with those from pjDHFR. Structural data are reported for two complexes of TMP with the double mutants Gln35Ser/Asn64Phe (Q35S/N64F) and Gln35Lys/Asn64Phe (Q35K/N64F) of hDHFR that unexpectedly show evidence for the binding of two molecules of TMP: one molecule that binds in the normal folate binding site and the second molecule that binds in a novel subpocket site such that the mutated residue Phe64 is involved in van der Waals contacts to the trimethoxyphenyl ring of the second TMP molecule. Kinetic data for the binding of TMP to hDHFR and pjDHFR reveal an 84-fold selectivity of TMP against pjDHFR (K(i) 49 nM) compared to hDHFR (K(i) 4093 nM). Two mutants that contain one substitution from pj--and one from the closely related Pneumocystis carinii DHFR (pcDHFR) (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) show K(i) values of 593 and 617 nM, respectively; these K(i) values are well above both the K(i) for pjDHFR and are similar to pcDHFR (Q35K/N64F and Q35S/N64F) (305nM). These results suggest that active site residues 35 and 64 play key roles in determining selectivity for pneumocystis DHFR, but that other residues contribute to the unique binding of inhibitors to these enzymes.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

As part of a high-throughput protocol, we use human editing that is based solely on class-average images to create final data sets that are enriched in what the investigator considers to be true-positive particles. The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) function is then used to characterize the homogeneity of different single-particle data sets that are derived from the same micrographs by two or more alternative methods. We find that the homogeneity is generally quite similar for class-edited data sets obtained by the texture-based method and by SIGNATURE, a cross-correlation-based method. The precision-recall characteristics of the texture-based method are, on the other hand, significantly better than those of the cross-correlation based method; that is to say, the texture-based approach produces a smaller fraction of false positives in the initial set of candidate particles. The computational efficiency of the two approaches is generally within a factor of two of one another.

As a component of the cell's nucleoskeleton, lamin A plays an important role in the mechanical stabilization of the nuclear envelope and in other nuclear functions. It is largely unknown how the characteristic 50 amino acid deletion affects the conformation of the mostly intrinsically disordered tail domain of lamin A. Here we perform replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the tail domain and determine an ensemble of semi-stable structures. Based on these structures we show that the ZMPSTE 24 cleavage site on the precursor form of the lamin A tail domain orients itself in such a way as to facilitate cleavage during the maturation process. We confirm our simulated structures by comparing the thermodynamic properties of the ensemble structures to in vitro stability measurements. Using this combination of experimental and computational techniques, we compare the size, heterogeneity of size, thermodynamic stability of the Ig-fold, as well as the mechanisms of force-induced denaturation. Our data shows that the Δ50 lamin A tail domain is more compact and displays less heterogeneity than the mature lamin A tail domain. Altogether these results suggest that the altered structure and stability of the tail domain can explain changed protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and may represent an etiology of the disease. Also, this study provides the first molecular structure(s) of the lamin A tail domain, which is confirmed by thermodynamic tests in experiment.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Mussel byssal threads are the anchorage of sessile mytilid mussels, which withstand recurring external loads from waves and tides. A single thread is elastic and ductile proximally, while the distal portion exhibits an extraordinary stiffness and toughness with a transient gradient of both mechanical features along the thread.

Here, structural analysis using polarized Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on stretched distal portions of mussel byssal threads determines the impact of external linear load on various molecular moieties. It is concluded that the preCol collagenous core domain is the main load-bearing element in distal byssal threads, while polyalanine beta-sheets in the flanking domains, similar to those found in spider silk proteins, provide high stiffness at low strains.

Here we present thorough analyses of four limiting factors: (a) electron-beam tilt, (b) inaccurate determination of defocus values, (c) focus gradient through particles, and (d) particularly for large particles, dynamic (multiple) scattering of electrons. We also propose strategies to cope with these factors: (a) the divergence and direction tilt components of electron-beam tilt could be reduced by maintaining parallel illumination and by using a coma-free alignment procedure, respectively. Moreover, the effect of all beam tilt components, including spiral tilt, could be eliminated by use of a spherical aberration corrector. (b) More accurate measurement of defocus value could be obtained by imaging areas adjacent to the target area at high electron dose and by measuring the image shift induced by tilting the electron beam. (c) Each known Fourier coefficient in the Fourier transform of a cryoEM image is the sum of two Fourier coefficients of the 3D structure, one on each of two curved 'characteristic surfaces' in 3D Fourier space. We describe a simple model-based iterative method that could recover these two Fourier coefficients on the two characteristic surfaces. (d) The effect of dynamic scattering could be corrected by deconvolution of a transfer function.

Our concepts were built on the paradigm of the USA-based structural genomics projects (http://www.nigms.nih.gov/psi), the Japanese initiatives (http://www.rsgi.riken.go.jp/rsgi_e), and some national efforts within Europe. At the same time, benefiting from the experience and technology development of the preceding projects, SPINE took an approach different from that of the mainstream of structural genomics: a major success of SPINE was to bring the cutting-edge high-throughput (HTP) technologies to biomedically relevant targets, not only facilitating the determination of no less than 308 novel structures, but also achieving a highly collaborative spirit and a culture of exchange of knowledge in technology. 
 
SPINE-2 Complexes (S2C) was both a continuation of SPINE and a whole new venture in its own right. Having largely achieved the integration of HTP technologies at partner sites, S2C aimed to facilitate the study of macromolecular complexes in key areas of biological research (ubiquitin (de-)conjugation, cell cycle and apoptosis, synaptogenesis and neuronal signaling, kinases and phosphatases, transcription receptors and regulation, innate and acquired immunity, and mechanisms in viral infection). S2C also worked to advance ‘wet-lab’ technologies relevant to the study of challenging targets (e.g., production of multi-subunit complexes with an emphasis on eukaryotic systems, biophysical methods to characterize complexes, and library tools for HTP screening), and ‘dry-lab’ technologies (e.g., microcrystal handling, docking software, as well as data management, analysis and dissemination tools). This ambitious agenda was backed-up by the long standing interests of the participant labs in the corresponding research themes, and was supported by a shared enthusiasm for consolidation of technologies and conceptual approaches, which together allowed us to showcase the structural study of complex systems. 
 
This special issue appears at a time at which Integrative Structural Biology is beginning to blossom. It seems, therefore, to be appropriate to take the opportunity to look back at what was achieved in S2C, and to present papers summarizing progress in key areas of biological interest, as well as on describing new technological achievements and benchmarking and extending existing methodologies.

Both film and the current generation of 16 megapixel (4k × 4k) CCD cameras have yielded high-resolution structures. Yet, despite the many advantages of CCD cameras, more than two times as many structures of biological macromolecules have been published in recent years using photographic film. The continued preference to film, especially for subnanometer-resolution structures, may be partially influenced by the finer sampling and larger effective specimen imaging area offered by film. Large format digital cameras may finally allow them to overtake film as the preferred detector for cryo-EM. We have evaluated a 111-megapixel (10k × 10k) CCD camera with a 9 μm pixel size. The spectral signal-to-noise ratios of low dose images of carbon film indicate that this detector is capable of providing signal up to at least 2/5 Nyquist frequency potentially retrievable for 3D reconstructions of biological specimens, resulting in more than double the effective specimen imaging area of existing 4k × 4k CCD cameras. We verified our estimates using frozen-hydrated ε15 bacteriophage as a biological test specimen with previously determined structure, yielding a ∼7 Å resolution single particle reconstruction from only 80 CCD frames.

Reconstructed volumes suffer from low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)(1) and artifacts caused by systematically missing tomographic data. Both problems can be overcome by combining multiple subvolumes with varying orientations, assuming they contain identical structures. Clustering (unsupervised classification) is required to ensure or verify population homogeneity, but this process is complicated by the problems of poor SNR and missing data, the factors that led to consideration of multiple subvolumes in the first place. Here, we describe a new approach to clustering and variance mapping in the face of these difficulties. The combined subvolume is taken as an estimate of the true subvolume, and the effect of missing data is computed for individual subvolumes. Clustering and variance mapping then proceed based on differences between expected and observed subvolumes.

Segmentation is a paramount stage for the interpretation of the reconstructed tomograms. Although several computational approaches have been proposed, none has prevailed as a generic method and thus segmentation through manual annotation is still a common choice. In this work we introduce a segmentation method targeted at membranes, which define the natural limits of compartments within biological specimens. Our method is based on local differential structure and on a Gaussian-like membrane model. First, it isolates information through scale-space and finds potential membrane-like points at a local scale. Then, the structural information is integrated at a global scale to yield the definite segmentation. We show and validate the performance of the algorithm on a number of tomograms under different experimental conditions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It filters large quantities of seawater for feeding. Sponges contain numerous, hydrated, brittle amorphous SiO₂ spicules of several types that form 70-80% by weight of the sponge. We performed mechanical tests to determine the functionality of the sponge skeleton. The potential effect of habitat on skeleton properties was investigated by comparing sponges from 0.5 m and 30 m depth. We determined how spicules contribute to maintaining the strength and macroscopic structural integrity of a sponge, and studied their deformation mechanisms under external loading, and their microscopic design parameters. Compression tests of cylindrical samples cut from sponges revealed their macroscopic deformation mechanisms. Experiments solely with the organic material (following spicules dissolution) revealed the contribution of the spicules to the load carrying capacity and structural integrity of the sponge. Cantilever bending tests of anchored spicules determined the strength of individual spicules, the sponge's main skeletal elements. As the strength of brittle spicules is statistical in nature, we used Weibull Statistics to define their strength and evaluate their Young's modulus. Shallow and deep-water sponges did not differ significantly neither in response to compression, nor in spicule strength under bending and tension. Spicule weight fraction within a sponge was significantly higher in shallow-water individuals. We conclude that the structural integrity and strength of this sponge's skeleton is derived from its low-strength, small spicules, produced by a cost-effective process. The operating deformation of the spicules (bending) and their design parameters make them highly efficient.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Mmf1 physically interacts with another mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33, which is involved in the sorting of cytochrome b₂ to the intermembrane space as well as mitochondrial ribosomal protein synthesis. To elucidate the structural basis for their interaction, we determined the crystal structures of Mmf1 and Mam33 at 1.74 and 2.10 Å, respectively. Both Mmf1 and Mam33 adopt a trimeric structure: each subunit of Mmf1 displays a chorismate mutase fold with a six-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helices on one side, whereas a subunit of Mam33 consists of a twisted six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. Biochemical assays combined with structure-based computational simulation enable us to model a putative complex of Mmf1-Mam33, which consists of one Mam33 trimer and two tandem Mmf1 trimers in a head-to-tail manner.

After applying a heat shock, insoluble protein aggregates are removed by centrifugation. Subsequently, the amount of remaining protein in the supernatant is quantified by in-gel fluorescence analysis and compared to samples without a heat shock treatment. Over 60 recombinant membrane proteins from Escherichia coli were subject to this screening in the presence and absence of a few commonly used detergents, and the results were analyzed.

In the reductive half of the indole oxygenation reaction, NADPH acts as a reducing agent, and NADP(+) remains at the active site, protecting bFMO from reoxidation. Here, the crystal structures of bFMO and bFMO in complex with NADP(+), and a mutant bFMO(Y207S), which lacks indole oxygenation activity, with and without indole are reported. The crystal structures revealed overlapping binding sites for NADP(+) and indole, suggestive of a double-displacement reaction mechanism for bFMO. In biochemical assays, indole inhibited NADPH oxidase activity, and NADPH in turn inhibited the binding of indole and decreased indoxyl production. Comparison of the structures of bFMO with and without bound NADP(+) revealed that NADPH induces conformational changes in two active site motifs. One of the motifs contained Arg-229, which participates in interactions with the phosphate group of NADPH and appears be a determinant of the preferential binding of bFMO to NADPH rather than NADH. The second motif contained Tyr-207. The mutant bFMO(Y207S) exhibited very little indoxyl producing activity; however, the NADPH oxidase activity of the mutant was higher than the wild-type enzyme.

We have now solved crystal structures of the recombinant PMI as apoenzyme and in complex with the potent peptidic inhibitor, KNI-10006, at the resolution of 2.4 and 3.1Å, respectively. The apoenzyme crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the structure has been refined to the final R-factor of 20.7%.

These so-called ""30 K proteins"" have been reported to be involved in the innate immune response and transportation of lipid and/or sugar. To elucidate their molecular functions, we determined the crystal structure of a 30 K protein, Bmlp7, at 1.91Å. It has two distinct domains: an all-α N-terminal domain (NTD) and an all-β C-terminal domain (CTD) of the β-trefoil fold. Comparative structural analysis indicates that Bmlp7 represents a new family, adding to the 14 families currently identified, of the β-trefoil superfamily. Structural comparison and simulation suggest that the NTD has a putative lipid-binding cavity, whereas the CTD has a potential sugar-binding site. However, we were unable to detect the binding of either lipid or sugar. Therefore, further investigations are needed to characterize the molecular function of this protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Knowledge of the structure and function of characteristic vesicles on the both sides of the gap junction, however, is limited. We used electron tomography to analyze the three-dimensional structure of crayfish gap junctions and gap junctional vesicles (GJVs). Tomographic analyses showed that some vesicles were anchored to innexons and almost all vesicles were connected by thin filaments. High densities inside the GJVs and projecting densities on the GJV membranes were observed in fixed and stained samples. Because the densities inside synaptic vesicles were dependent on the fixative conditions, different fixative conditions were used to elucidate the molecules included in the GJVs. The projecting densities on the GJVs were studied by immunoelectron microscopy with anti-vesicular monoamine transporter (anti-VMAT) and anti-vesicular nucleotide transporter (anti-VNUT) antibodies. Some of the projecting densities were labeled by anti-VNUT, but not anti-VMAT. Three-dimensional analyses of GJVs and excitatory chemical synaptic vesicles (CSVs) revealed clear differences in their sizes and central densities. Furthermore, the imaging data obtained under different fixative conditions and the immunolabeling results, in which GJVs were positively labeled for anti-VNUT but excitatory CSVs were not, support our model that GJVs contain nucleotides and excitatory CSVs do not. We propose a model in which characteristic GJVs containing nucleotides play an important role in the signal processing in gap junctions of crayfish LGFs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To identify protein-protein interfaces using NMR, resonance assignments are generally necessary to analyze the data; however, they are time consuming to collect, especially for large proteins. In this paper, we present a rapid, effective, and unbiased approach for the identification of a protein-protein interface without resonance assignments. This approach requires only a single set of 2D titration experiments of a single protein sample, labeled with a unique combination of an (15)N-labeled amino acid and several amino acids (13)C-labeled on specific atoms. To rapidly obtain high resolution data, we applied a new pulse sequence for time-shared NMR measurements that allowed simultaneous detection of a ω(1)-TROSY-type backbone (1)H-(15)N and aromatic (1)H-(13)C shift correlations together with single quantum methyl (1)H-(13)C shift correlations. We developed a structure-based computational approach, that uses our experimental data to search the protein surfaces in an unbiased manner to identify the residues involved in the protein-protein interface. Finally, we demonstrated that the obtained information of the molecular interface could be directly leveraged to support protein-protein docking studies. Such rapid construction of a complex model provides valuable information and enables more efficient biochemical characterization of a protein-protein complex, for instance, as the first step in structure-guided drug development.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

For immuno-gold EM, cryo-sections are retrieved from the cryo-chamber on a droplet of a pick-up solution (paste-like and almost frozen) to which the sections attach. The sections are then placed on an EM specimen grid at room temperature. This procedure compromises the ultrastructure, resulting in folds, holes, and loss of the original material. In this paper we show the critical influence of humidity, stretching, and relief of compression during thawing of the sections. We show a new lift-up hinge device for semi-automated retrieval of cryo-sections that results in significantly improved section quality. This approach was also applied successfully to vitreous sections from high pressure frozen samples. An important advance is that these vitreous cryo-sections can now successfully be post-fixed and immunolabelled after thawing; this allows cryo-EM comparison with adjacent ribbons of sections still in the frozen hydrated state. These findings call for technical innovations aiming at automated cryo-ultramicrotomy in a fully controlled environment for improved localization of proteins within their 'close to native' cellular context and correlative electron cryo-tomography of consecutive ribbons of sections of one frozen hydrated sample.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To address some of these issues, we have developed a new experimental approach involving the use of specific monoclonal antibodies as recognition tools. One such antibody was raised against a homogeneous, mixed, ordered monolayer phase comprised of 60:40 mol% cholesterol:C16-ceramide, and has been used previously to demonstrate the existence of C16-ceramide/cholesterol domains in the membranes of cultured cells. We now use a combination of quantitative fluorescence microscopy, immuno-transmission electron microscopy and immuno-scanning cryo-electron microscopy, optimized for the study of intracellular lipid antigens. In a variety of cultured cells, C16-ceramide/cholesterol structural domains were found at high levels in late endosomes and in the trans-Golgi network, but were not found at statistically significant levels in early endosomes, lysosomes or the endoplasmic reticulum.

It is thought that such phase-plate implementations might result in higher quality images, free from the problems of CTF correction that occur when images must be recorded at extremely high values of defocus. In single-particle cryo-electron microscopy it is hoped that these improvements in image quality will facilitate work on structures that have proved difficult to study, either because of their relatively small size or because the structures are not completely homogeneous.

We present a method for quantitatively modeling the images recorded with 200keV electrons, for single particles embedded in vitreous ice.

The inability to produce 'keystone' subunits in a soluble and correctly folded form is a serious impediment to the reconstitution of the complexes. Co-expression of the components offers a valuable alternative to the expression of single proteins as a route to obtain sufficient amounts of the sample of interest. Even in cases where milligram-scale quantities of purified complex of interest become available, there is still no guarantee that good quality crystals can be obtained. At this step, protein engineering of one or more components of the complex is frequently required to improve solubility, yield or the ability to crystallize the sample. Subsequent characterization of these constructs may be performed by solution techniques such as Small Angle X-ray Scattering and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to identify 'well behaved' complexes. Herein, we recount our experiences gained at protein production and complex assembly during the European 3D Repertoire project (3DR). The goal of this consortium was to obtain structural information on multi-protein complexes from yeast by combining crystallography, electron microscopy, NMR and in silico modeling methods.

HCMV tegument plays essential roles in HCMV infection and assembly. Using cryo electron tomography (cryoET), here we show that HCMV tegument compartment can be divided into two sub-compartments: an inner and an outer tegument. The inner tegument consists of densely-packed proteins surrounding the capsid. The outer tegument contains those components that are loosely packed in the space between the inner tegument and the pleomorphic glycoprotein-containing envelope. To systematically characterize the inner tegument proteins interacting with the capsid, we used chemical treatment to strip off the entire envelope and most tegument proteins to obtain a tegumented capsid with inner tegument proteins. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses show that only two tegument proteins, UL32-encoded pp150 and UL48-encoded high molecular weight protein (HMWP), remains unchanged in their abundance in the tegumented capsids as compared to their abundance in the intact particles. Three-dimensional reconstructions by single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) reveal that the net-like layer of icosahedrally-ordered tegument densities are also the same in the tegumented capsid and in the intact particles. CryoET reconstruction of the tegumented capsid labeled with an anti-pp150 antibody is consistent with the biochemical and cryoEM data in localizing pp150 within the ordered tegument. Taken together, these results suggest that pp150, a betaherpesvirus-specific tegument protein, is a constituent of the net-like layer of icosahedrally-ordered capsid-bound tegument densities, a structure lacking similarities in alpha and gammaherpesviruses.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In terrestrial species calcium carbonate is subject to resorption, storage and recycling in order to retain significant fractions of the mineral during the moulting cycle. We used synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis and Raman spectroscopy to quantify the ACC/calcite ratio, the mineral phase distribution and the composition within the anterior and posterior tergite cuticle during eight different stages of the moulting cycle of Porcellio scaber. The results show that most of the amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is resorbed from the cuticle, whereas calcite remains in the old cuticle and is shed during moulting. During premoult resorption of ACC from the posterior cuticle is accompanied by an increase within the anterior tergites, and mineralization of the new posterior cuticle by resorption of mineral from the anterior cuticle. This suggests that one reason for using ACC in cuticle mineralization is to facilitate resorption and recycling of cuticular calcium carbonate.

Since the same PCR product can be inserted in all but one of the vectors, this allows efficiency in versatility while screening for optimal expression strategies.

Finally, we exemplify the use of our vectors for bacterial co-expression and for expression in insect cells, with USP4 and USP7 respectively. We conclude that our ligation-independent cloning strategy allows for high-throughput screening for the expression of soluble proteins in a variety of vectors in E. coli and in insect cells.

In this review, we draw upon recently elucidated paramyxovirus-, arenavirus-, and poxvirus-host protein complex crystal structures to reveal both the capacity of viruses to appropriate one component of a physiological protein–protein binding event (often modifying it to out-compete the host-protein), and the ability to utilize novel binding sites on host cell surface receptors. The structures discussed shed light on a number of biological processes ranging from viral entry to virulence and host antagonism. Drawn together they reveal the common strategies which viruses have evolved to interact with their natural host.

In order to understand more about proteoglycan organisation and collagen associations in the cornea, three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstructions of collagen-proteoglycan interactions in the anterior, mid and posterior stroma from a Chst5 knockout mouse, which lacks a keratan sulphate sulphotransferase, were obtained. Both longitudinal and transverse section show sinuous, oversized proteoglycans with near-periodic, orthogonal off-shoots. In many cases, these proteoglycans traverse over 400nm of interfibrillar space interconnecting over 10 collagen fibrils. The reconstructions suggest that multiple chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate proteoglycans have aggregated laterally and, possibly, end-to-end, with orthogonal extensions protruding from the main electron-dense stained filament.

Crystalline carbonated hydroxyapatite, an inorganic calcium phosphate mineral, constitutes a substantial fraction of mature bone tissue. Yet key aspects of the mineral formation mechanism, transport pathways and deposition in the extracellular matrix remain unidentified. Using cryo-electron microscopy on native frozen-hydrated tissues we show that during mineralization of developing mouse calvaria and long bones, bone-lining cells concentrate membrane-bound mineral granules within intracellular vesicles. Elemental analysis and electron diffraction show that the intracellular mineral granules consist of disordered calcium phosphate, a highly metastable phase and a potential precursor of carbonated hydroxyapatite. The intracellular mineral contains considerably less calcium than expected for synthetic amorphous calcium phosphate, suggesting the presence of a cellular mechanism by which phosphate entities are first formed and thereafter gradually sequester calcium within the vesicles. We thus demonstrate that in vivo osteoblasts actively produce disordered mineral packets within intracellular vesicles for mineralization of the extracellular developing bone tissue. The use of a highly disordered precursor mineral phase that later crystallizes within an extracellular matrix is a strategy employed in the formation of fish fin bones and by various invertebrate phyla.

The mechanical role of IFs has been mostly inferred from measurements performed on individual filaments or gels in vitro. In this study we employ atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the contribution of vimentin IFs to the nanomechanical properties of living cells under native conditions. To specifically target and modulate the vimentin network, Rat-2 fibroblasts were transfected with GFP-desmin variants. Cells expressing desmin variants were identified by the fluorescence microscopy extension of the AFM instrument. This allowed us to directly compare the nanomechanical response of transfected and untransfected cells at high spatial resolution by means of AFM. Depending on the variant desmin, transfectants were either softer or stiffer than untransfected fibroblasts. Expression of the non-filament forming GFP-DesL345P mutant led to a collapse of the endogenous vimentin network in the perinuclear region that was accompanied by localized stiffening. Correlative confocal microscopy indicates that the expression of desmin variants specifically targets the endogenous vimentin IF network without major rearrangements of other cytoskeletal components. By measuring functional changes caused by IF rearrangements in intact cells, we show that IFs play a crucial role in mechanical behavior not only at large deformations but also in the nanomechanical response of individual cells.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

 Abstract
 
 Multiprotein complexes catalyze vital biological functions in the cell. A paramount objective of the SPINE2 project was to address the structural molecular biology of these multiprotein complexes, by enlisting and developing enabling technologies for their study. An emerging key prerequisite for studying complex biological specimens is their recombinant overproduction. Novel reagents and streamlined protocols for rapidly assembling co-expression constructs for this purpose have been designed and validated. The high-throughput pipeline implemented at IGBMC Strasbourg and the ACEMBL platform at the EMBL Grenoble utilize recombinant overexpression systems for heterologous expression of proteins and their complexes. Extension of the ACEMBL platform technology to include eukaryotic hosts such as insect and mammalian cells has been achieved. Efficient production of large multicomponent protein complexes for structural studies using the baculovirus/insect cell system can be hampered by a stoichiometric imbalance of the subunits produced. A polyprotein strategy has been developed to overcome this bottleneck and has been successfully implemented in our MultiBac baculovirus expression system for producing multiprotein complexes.

However, not all amyloid-forming proteins act as prions. Here, we compared two homologs of the yeast prion protein Ure2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus, ScUre2p and SpUre2p, which have different prion propensities in vivo. We also addressed the controversial issue of whether hydrated fibrils of Ure2 show a fundamentally different X-ray diffraction pattern than dried samples. Using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and wide angle X-ray scattering of dried and concentrated hydrated fibrils, we compared the fibril structure of ScUre2p and SpUre2p. The results show that fibrils of ScUre2p and SpUre2 have a similar cross-β core under dried and hydrated conditions, with the same inter-strand and inter-sheet spacings. Given the different prion propensity of the two Ure2p homologs, this suggests that the detailed organization of the cross-β core may play an important role in the efficiency of prion propagation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Previously, the BFPvvD7 mutant generated by directed evolution displayed a fourfold enhancement in fluorescent intensity. Herein, a further increase in fluorescence in the new BFPvvD8 mutant, with three additional mutations from BFPvvD7, was made. To understand the underlying mechanism of the increased fluorescent intensity of BFPvv, we solved the BFPvvD8-NADPH complex structure. Accompanied with lifetime detection, we proposed that the enhanced intensity is related to the conformational change caused by a glycine residue (Gly176) mutated to other non-glycine residues at a turn close to the NADPH binding site. We also observed the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from our BFPvvD8 to each of the GFP-like fluorescent proteins, mTFP1 and EGFP, joined by an eight-residue linker between the N-terminal of BFPvvD8 and the C-terminal of GFPs. Taken together, with the newly solved BFPvvD8 structure, our results not only provide new considerations within the rational-based protein engineering of this NADPH-dependent BFP, but also suggest that BFPvvD8 could be a potential candidate in FRET-based biosensor techniques.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In this study, we focus on the effect of the choice of the expression vector system: by standardizing experimental factors including bacterial strain, cultivation temperature and growth medium composition, we compare the effectiveness of expression technologies used by the partners of the Structural Proteomics in Europe 2 (SPINE2-complexes) consortium. Four different protein complexes, including three binary and one ternary complex, all known to be produced in the soluble form in E. coli, are used as the benchmark targets.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the recognition between the surface of its protein capsid and cellular components of its vector, host and viral proteins synthesized upon infection, the wild type GFLV strain F13 and a natural mutant (GFLV-TD) carrying a Gly₂₉₇Asp mutation were purified, characterized and crystallized.

The diffraction limit of GFLV-F13 crystals was extended from 5.5 to 3 Å by growth in agarose gel. Preliminary crystallographic analyses indicate that both types of crystals are suitable for structure determination.

We report here its crystallographic structure at 1.5Å resolution which shows significant differences in the vicinity of residue 64 and of the chromophore. In particular, two conformations are observed for the key residue glutamic acid 222, in apparent contradiction with the single fluorescence lifetime of the protein. We then show that X-ray induced decarboxylation of Glu222 during diffraction data collection results in the disruption of a hydrogen-bond network near the chromophore. Using single-crystal microspectrophotometry, we demonstrate that this correlates with a significant loss of the fluorescence properties. We thus propose a mechanism of bleaching of the protein at low temperature.

However, though the nucleolus' ultrastructure is well characterized in mammals and birds, it has been so far much less studied in reptiles. In this work, we examined the ultrastructural organization of the nucleolus in various tissues from different reptilian species (three turtles, three lizards, two crocodiles, and three snakes). Using cytochemical and immunocytological methods, we showed that in reptiles both types of nucleolus are present: a bi-compartmentalized nucleolus in turtles and a tri-compartmentalized nucleolus in the other species examined in this study. Furthermore, in a given species, the same type of nucleolus is present in all the tissues, however, the importance and the repartition of those nucleolar components could vary from one tissue to another. We also reveal that, contrary to the mammalian nucleolus, the reptilian fibrillar centers contain small clumps of condensed chromatin and that their surrounding dense fibrillar component is thicker.

The vaterite has generally higher Mg/Ca and lower Na/Ca, K/Ca than the aragonite. In addition, δ¹³C is also always lower.

Co-expression is now widely recognized as a major technique for assembling multiprotein complexes and many co-expression systems are currently available for performing co-expression experiments in different hosts. However, comparative knowledge on co-expression strategies is still crucially lacking. Using versatile co-expression systems for Escherichia coli, the pET-MCN and pET-MCP series, and ternary protein complexes as examples, we demonstrate how to successfully delineate correct co-expression strategies. Specifically, an appropriate, complex-dependent approach alleviates stoichiometry imbalance and yield problems, and even failure in producing complexes. Importantly, some of the parameters influencing co-expression strategies appear independent of the expression host, thus having implications for co-expression in eukaryotic hosts. By further using these strategies, we show that co-expression in E. coli enables reconstitution of protein complexes as large as the deubiquitination module of the SAGA transcription factor and the histone octamer.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The comparative analysis of three crystal structures of AcrB-DARPin complexes allowed us to study the plasticity of the interaction with this dominant binding site. Seemingly redundant AcrB-DARPin crystals show substantially different diffraction quality as a result of subtle differences in the binding geometry. This work exemplifies the importance to screen a number of crystallization chaperones to obtain optimal diffraction data.

Especially, stress distribution in the plaque fibrous capsule is an important determinant for the risk of vulnerable plaque rupture. Knowledge of the stiffness of atherosclerotic plaque components is therefore of critical importance. In this work, force mapping experiments using atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mouse, which represents the most widely used experimental model for studying mechanisms underlying the development of atherosclerotic lesions. To obtain the elastic material properties of fibrous caps and lipidic cores of atherosclerotic plaques, serial cross-sections of aortic arch lesions were probed at different sites. Atherosclerotic plaque sub-structures were subdivided into cellular fibrotic, hypocellular fibrotic and lipidic rich areas according to histological staining. Hertz's contact mechanics were used to determine elasticity (Young's) moduli that were related to the underlying histological plaque structure. Cellular fibrotic regions exhibit a mean Young modulus of 10.4±5.7kPa. Hypocellular fibrous caps were almost six-times stiffer, with average modulus value of 59.4±47.4kPa, locally rising up to ∼250kPa. Lipid rich areas exhibit a rather large range of Young's moduli, with average value of 5.5±3.5kPa.

However, there are still many possible, less studied ways of scoring fits. In this paper, we introduce four scores new to cryoEM fitting and compare their performance to three known scores. Our benchmark consists of (a) 4 protein assemblies with simulated maps at 5-20 Å resolution, including the heptameric ring of GroEL; and (b) 4 experimental maps of GroEL at ∼6-23 Å resolution with corresponding fitted atomic models. We perturb each fit 1000 times and assess each new fit with each score. The correlation between a score and the Cα RMSD of each fit from the ""correctly"" fitted structure shows that the CCF is one of the best scores, but in certain situations could be augmented or even replaced by other scores. For instance, our implementation of a score based on mutual information outperforms or is comparable to the CCF in almost all test cases, and our new ""envelope score"" works as well as the CCF at sub-nanometer resolution but is an order of magnitude faster to calculate. The results also suggest that the width of the Gaussian function used to blur the atomic structure into a density map can significantly affect the fitting process.

Furthermore, the functional activity of Mtb-DHBPS and its dimeric state could be restored by increasing the pH between 6.0 and 9.0. The comparison of crystal structures determined at different pH revealed that the overall three-dimensional structure of Mtb-DHBPS monomer remains the same. However, the length of the α6-helix at pH 6.0 has increased from 15 to 22 Å in pH 4.0 by increasing the number of amino acids contributing to the α6-helix from 11 to 15, achieving a higher structural stability at pH 4.0.

In several cases, the differences related to cold- or warm-adaptation are related to subtle structural and aminoacidic differences at the molecular level, often hard to detect. In this context, we present a comparative study of psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic subtilisin-like serine proteases by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent using a multiple-replica approach. Our results strongly enforce the current view on localized flexibility in crucial functional regions for cold-adapted serine proteases and point out a different optimization and usage of salt-bridge interactions and networks in cold- and warm-adapted enzymes. The analyses allow to identify a subset of structural and dynamic features strictly associated to cold adaptation and which change from cold- to heat-active subtilisins. In particular, the thermophilic subtilisin presents a high affinity calcium binding site which is not structurally conserved in the mesophilic and psychrophilic counterparts, which, as it turns out from the MD analyses, at the same position show a stable salt bridge network and no stabilizing intra-molecular interactions, respectively. These aspects, along with differential flexibility in regions close to the active site or substrate binding pocket, can be an indication of evolution at this protein site toward a lower stability moving from high to low temperature conditions.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Sequence analysis indicated Sa240 from Staphylococcus aureus was a ribose pyranase homolog. Here we showed that Sa240 formed dimeric structure both in solution and in crystal. S240-ribose complex structure showed a ribose binding site formed by an incomplete active site compared with RbsD. Because the catalytic activity of ribose pyranase depends on its oligomeric state, we propose Sa240 is catalytically inactive in its dimeric structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A full 3D tomographic reconstruction of a section of this material reveals that the predominantly chitin material is assembled in the wing scale to form a structure whose geometry bears a remarkable correspondence to the srs net, well-known in solid state chemistry and soft materials science. The porous solid is bounded to an excellent approximation by a parallel surface to the Gyroid, a three-periodic minimal surface with cubic crystallographic symmetry I4₁32, as foreshadowed by Stavenga and Michielson. The scale of the structure is commensurate with the wavelength of visible light, with an edge of the conventional cubic unit cell of the parallel-Gyroid of approximately 310 nm. The genesis of this structure is discussed, and we suggest it affords a remarkable example of templating of a chiral material via soft matter, analogous to the formation of mesoporous silica via surfactant assemblies in solution. In the butterfly, the templating is achieved by the lipid-protein membranes within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (while it remains in the chrysalis), that likely form cubic membranes, folded according to the form of the Gyroid. The subsequent formation of the chiral hard chitin framework is suggested to be driven by the gradual polymerisation of the chitin precursors, whose inherent chiral assembly in solution (during growth) promotes the formation of a single enantiomer.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Our previous study, however, showed that AQP11 is water permeable in proteoliposomes in which AQP11 molecules were reconstituted after purification with Fos-choline 10, which is the most suitable detergent available for stable solubilization of AQP11. In our previous study, we were unable to exclude the effect of the detergent on the water conductance. Therefore, in the present study, we measured the water permeability of AQP11 without detergent using vesicles that directly formed from Sf9 cell membranes expressing AQP11 molecules. The water permeability of AQP11 was 8-fold lower than that of AQP1 and 3-fold higher than that of mock-infected cell membrane, and was reversibly inhibited by mercury ions. Considering the slow but constant water permeable functions of AQP11, we performed homology modeling to search for a common structural feature. When comparing our model with those of other AQP structures, we found that Tyr83 facing the channel pore might be a key amino acid residue that decreases the water permeation of AQP11.

A well known example is the nacre of mollusk shells, commonly called ""mother of pearl"", whose excellent strength and toughness has been the subject of research for many decades. A significant discovery has been the presence of periodic layers called ""growth lines"". These are thin distinct layers within the bulk of the shell which form periodically, with their structure affected by environmental changes. Studies of their formation and behavior offer valuable insight into the architecture of seashells. In this work, the structure and mechanical behavior of growth lines in shells of abalone Haliotis gigantea were investigated using electron microscopy and nanoindentation. Growth lines form directly out of nacre into layers of blocks and irregular particles. In comparison to nacre, they have basic structures, form rapidly, and are harder, which suggest that they serve a protective role during lifecycle transitions.

We particularly emphasize that the standard CTF correction does not account for the phase error associated with coma.

Although current models for the function of the protein focus on its binding to myosin S2, other evidence suggests that it may also bind to F-actin. We have previously shown that the N-terminal fragment C0-C2 of cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) bundles actin, providing evidence for interaction of cMyBP-C and actin. In this paper we directly examined the interaction between C0-C2 and F-actin at physiological ionic strength and pH by negative staining and electron microscopy. We incubated C0-C2 (5-30μM, in a buffer containing in mM: 180 KCl, 1 MgCl(2), 1 EDTA, 1 DTT, 20 imidazole, at pH 7.4) with F-actin (5μM) for 30min and examined negatively-stained samples of the solution by electron microscopy (EM). Examination of EM images revealed that C0-C2 bound to F-actin to form long helically-ordered complexes. Fourier transforms indicated that C0-C2 binds with the helical periodicity of actin with strong 1st and 6th layer lines. The results provide direct evidence that the N-terminus of cMyBP-C can bind to F-actin in a periodic complex.

The susceptibility of CaM to oxidation in the different conformations that are sampled during calcium signaling is currently not well defined. Using an integrative mass spectrometry (MS) approach, applying both native MS and LC/MS/MS, we unravel molecular details of CaM methionine oxidation in the context of its interaction with the Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Sensitivity to methionine oxidation in CaM was found to vary according to the conformational state. Three methionine residues (Met71, 72, 145) show increased reactivity in calcium-saturated CaM (holo-CaM) compared to calcium-free CaM (apo-CaM), which has important consequences for oxidation-targeted proteasomal degradation. In addition, all four methionines in the C-terminal lobe (Met109, 124, 144 and 145) are found to be protected from oxidation in a peptide-based model of the CaMKII-bound conformation (cbp-CaM). We furthermore demonstrate that the oxidation of Met144 and 145 inhibits the interaction of CaM with CaMKII. cbp-CaM, in contrast to apo- and holo-CaM, maintains its ability to bind CaMKII under simulated conditions of oxidative stress and is also protected from oxidation-induced unfolding. Thus, we show that the susceptibility towards oxidation of specific residues in CaM is tightly linked to its signaling state and conformation, which has direct implications for calcium/CaM-CaMKII related signaling.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is established that amelogenin proteins, the main constituent of the developing enamel matrix, form nanospheres in vitro, but the amphiphilic nature of the full-length protein conveys the possibility of generating more complex structures as observed with other surfactant-like molecules. This study tested if the use of metastable oil-water emulsions can induce supramolecular assemblies of amelogenin. Recombinant full-length amelogenin, rH174, was mixed into octanol/ethyl acetate preparations of different ratios to form emulsions at pH 4.5 and 7.4. Atomic force and electron microscopy showed the formation of 16.7±1.0nm wide nanoribbons which grew to several micrometer length over a period of days. Nanoribbons formed from reverse micelles by enabling hydrophobic tails of the molecules to interact while preventing the formation of amelogenin nanospheres. Ribbon formation required the presence of calcium and phosphate ions and may be localized at a dark central line along the amelogenin ribbons. The ribbons have a strong tendency to align in parallel maintaining 5-20nm space between each other. The growth rates and number of ribbons were significantly higher at pH 4.5 and related to the metastability of the emulsion. A model for ribbon extension proposes the addition of short segments or amelogenin dimers to the ends of the ribbon.

 Abstract
 
 The M protein of coronavirus plays a central role in virus assembly, turning cellular membranes into workshops where virus and host factors come together to make new virus particles. We investigated how M structure and organization is related to virus shape and size using cryo-electron microscopy, tomography and statistical analysis. We present evidence that suggests M can adopt two conformations and that membrane curvature is regulated by one M conformer. Elongated M protein is associated with rigidity, clusters of spikes and a relatively narrow range of membrane curvature. In contrast, compact M protein is associated with flexibility and low spike density. Analysis of several types of virus-like particles and virions revealed that S protein, N protein and genomic RNA each help to regulate virion size and variation, presumably through interactions with M. These findings provide insight into how M protein functions to promote virus assembly.

UBF (Upstream Binding Factor), a DNA binding protein and component of the pol I transcription machinery, is considered to be responsible for the loose chromatin structure of the active rDNA. Here we question whether such structure alone can ensure early replication of DNA. We investigate this problem on the model of pseudo-NORs, the tandem arrays of heterologous DNA sequence with high affinity for UBF, introduced into human chromosomes. Such arrays are not transcribed, yet efficiently bind UBF and mimic the chromatin structure of active rDNA. In our study, a human derived stable cell line containing one pseudo-NOR on the chromosome 10 was transiently transfected with UBF-GFP and PCNA-RFP, which allowed us to observe in vivo the growth of pseudo-NORs resulted from their replication. We found that replication of pseudo-NORs is not restricted to the early S phase, but continues in the late S phase at a significant level. These results were confirmed in the experiments with incorporation of thymidin analog EdU and BrdU ChIP assay. Similar results were obtained with another cell line containing pseudo-NOR on the chromosome 7. Our data indicate that the specific loose structure of chromatin, produced by the architect protein UBF, is not sufficient for the early replication.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We determined the crystal structure at 3.2Å resolution of the first dodecaheme cytochrome c (GSU1996) along with its N-terminal and C-terminal hexaheme fragments at 2.6 and 2.15Å resolution, respectively. The macroscopic reduction potentials of the full-length protein and its fragments were measured. The sequence of GSU1996 can be divided into four c(7)-type domains (A, B, C and D) with homology to triheme cytochromes c(7). In cytochromes c(7) all three hemes are bis-His coordinated, whereas in c(7)-type domains the last heme is His-Met coordinated. The full-length GSU1996 has a 12nm long crescent shaped structure with the 12 hemes arranged along a polypeptide to form a ""nanowire"" of hemes; it has a modular structure. Surprisingly, while the C-terminal half of the protein consists of two separate c(7)-type domains (C and D) connected by a small linker, the N-terminal half of the protein has two c(7)-type domains (A and B) that form one structural unit.

There is an unexpected interaction between the hemes at the interface of domains A and B, which form a heme-pair with nearly parallel stacking of their porphyrin rings.

The factors affecting structural development, including IF length dispersion, and presence of other macromolecular solutes, are discussed in terms of the statistical thermodynamic models presented over 30 years ago by P.J. Flory and co-workers. The crucial role of pendant IF head groups in controlling IF separation and stabilizing the mesophase is emphasised. In particular, a concerted process of polymerization of unit-length IF precursors coupled with continuous transfer of longer IFs to the anisotropic phase is invoked. Observed structures in differentiated cell lines in mature fibres are rationalised in terms of different possible nematic or double-twist liquid crystalline precursor structures, with varying degrees of anisotropic phase coalescence. The occurrence of rarely observed macromolecular double-twist structures is made plausible by qualitative analysis of mesophase mechanics and reference to alternative structures in other macromolecular mesogens.

This is typically the case for the collagen triple helices inside fibrils, as confirmed by recent X-ray diffraction experiments carried out on highly crystallized fibers obtained by immersing the freshly extracted fibers in a salt-controlled medium. However such diffraction patterns also generally exhibit additional features in the form of diffuse scattering, which is a clear signature of a low degree of lateral ordering. Only few studies have analyzed and modeled the lateral packing of collagen triple helices when the structure is disordered. Some authors have used the concept of short-range order but this approach does not contain any echo of a hexagonal order. In this study, we use an analytical expression derived from the paracrystal model which retains the hexagonal symmetry information and leads to a good agreement with the experimental data in the medium-angle region. This method is quite sensitive to the degree of disorder and to the inter-object distance. One clear result is that the shift in peak positions, generally attributed to variations in intermolecular distances, can also arise from a change in the degree of ordering without any significant modification of the distances. This underlines the importance of evaluating the degree of ordering before attributing a shift in peak position to a change in the unit-cell. This method is generic and can be applied to any system composed of rod-shaped molecules.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Several acarviostatins isolated from Streptomyces coelicoflavus var. nankaiensis previously showed more potent inhibition of HPA than acarbose, which has been successfully used in clinical therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which acarviostatins inhibit HPA remains elusive. Here we determined crystal structures of HPA in complexes with a series of acarviostatin inhibitors (I03, II03, III03, and IV03). Structural analyses showed that acarviostatin I03 undergoes a series of hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the HPA active site, similar to acarbose, while acarviostatins II03, III03, and IV03 likely undergo only hydrolysis reactions. On the basis of structural analysis combined with kinetic assays, we demonstrate that the final modified product with seven sugar rings is best suited for occupying the full active site and shows the most efficient inhibition of HPA. Our high resolution structures reported here identify first time an interaction between an inhibitor and subsite-4 of the HPA active site, which we show makes a significant contribution to the inhibitory effect.

These levels cover a wide range of length and time scales: from the atomic structures of macromolecules for inferring their molecular function, to the quantitative description of their abundance, and spatial distribution in the cell. Emerging new experimental technologies are greatly increasing the availability of such spatial information on the molecular organization in living cells. This review addresses three fields that have significantly contributed to our understanding of the proteome's spatial and temporal organization: first, methods for the structure determination of individual macromolecular assemblies, specifically the fitting of atomic structures into density maps generated from electron microscopy techniques; second, research that visualizes the spatial distributions of these complexes within the cellular context using cryo electron tomography techniques combined with computational image processing; and third, methods for the spatial modeling of the dynamic organization of the proteome, specifically those methods for simulating reaction and diffusion of proteins and complexes in crowded intracellular fluids.

The inhibitory concentration at 50% inhibition (IC(50)) of TCL against the Escherichia coli ENR is 150nM for wild type (WT), 380, 470 and 68,500nM for Ala, Ser and Val mutants, respectively. To understand this high TCL resistance in the G93V mutant, we obtained the crystal structures of mutated ENRs complexed with TCL and NAD(+). The X-ray structural analysis along with the ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations explains the serious consequence in the G93V mutant complex. The major interactions around TCL due to the aromatic(cation)-aromatic and hydrogen bonding interactions are found to be conserved both in WT and mutant complexes. Thus, the overall structural change of protein is minimal except that a flexible α-helical turn around TCL is slightly pushed away due to the presence of the bulky valine group. However, TCL shows substantial edge-to-face aromatic (π)-interactions with both the flexible R192-F203 region and the residues in the close vicinity of G93. The weakening of some edge-to-face aromatic interactions around TCL in the G93V mutant results in serious resistance to TCL.

When new bone is deposited, some of the osteoblasts are embedded in the mineralizing collagen matrix and differentiate to osteocytes, forming a dense network throughout the whole bone tissue. Here, we investigate the extent to which the organization of the osteocyte network controls the collagen matrix arrangement found in various bone tissues. Several tissue types from equine, ovine and murine bone have been examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy as well as polarized light microscopy and back-scattered electron imaging. From comparing the spatial arrangements of unorganized and organized bone, we propose that the formation of a highly oriented collagen matrix requires an alignment of osteoblasts whereby a substrate layer provides a surface such that osteoblasts can align and, collectively, build new matrix. Without such a substrate, osteoblasts act isolated and only form matrices without long range order. Hence, we conclude that osteoblasts synthesize and utilize scaffold-like primary tissue as a guide for the deposition of highly ordered and mechanically competent bone tissue by a collective action of many cells.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To gain insight into DMP1 functions in dentin mineralization we have performed immunomapping of DMP1 in fully mineralized rat incisors and in vitro calcium phosphate mineralization experiments in the presence of DMP1. DMP1 immunofluorescene was localized in peritubular dentin (PTD) and along the dentin-enamel boundary. In vitro phosphorylated DMP1 induced the formation of parallel arrays of crystallites with their c-axes co-aligned. Such crystalline arrangement is a hallmark of mineralized collagen fibrils of bone and dentin. Interestingly, in DMP1-rich PTD, which lacks collagen fibrils, the crystals are organized in a similar manner.

Here, we implemented an interactive peak-selection strategy that enables the user to explore a preliminary score landscape generated by the colors tool of Situs. The interactive placement of components, one at a time, is advantageous for low-resolution or ambiguously shaped maps, which are sometimes difficult to interpret by the fully automatic peak selection of colors.

(2008)). However, widespread application of this methodology to proteins of unknown structures is hindered by the lack of a general strategy to place spin label pairs in the primary sequence. In this work, we report the development of an algorithm that optimally selects spin labeling positions for the purpose of distance measurements by EPR. For the α-helical subdomain of T4 lysozyme (T4L), simulated restraints that maximize sequence separation between the two spin labels while simultaneously ensuring pairwise connectivity of secondary structure elements yielded vastly improved models by Rosetta folding. 54% of all these models have the correct fold compared to only 21% and 8% correctly folded models when randomly placed restraints or no restraints are used, respectively. Moreover, the improvements in model quality require a limited number of optimized restraints, which is determined by the pairwise connectivities of T4L α-helices. The predicted improvement in Rosetta model quality was verified by experimental determination of distances between spin labels pairs selected by the algorithm. Overall, our results reinforce the rationale for the combined use of sparse EPR distance restraints and de novo folding. By alleviating the experimental bottleneck associated with restraint selection, this algorithm sets the stage for extending computational structure determination to larger, traditionally elusive protein topologies of critical structural and biochemical importance.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Human cystatin C (hCC) has been also recognized as an aggregating protein directly involved in the formation of pathological amyloid fibrils, and these amyloidogenic properties greatly increase in a naturally occurring L68Q hCC variant. For a long time only dimeric structure of wild-type hCC has been known. The dimer is created through 3D domain swapping process, in which two parts of the cystatin structure become separated from each other and next exchanged between two molecules. Important role in the domain swapping plays the L1 loop, which connects the exchanging segments and, upon dimerization, transforms from a β-turn into a part of a long β-strand. In the very recently published first monomeric structure of human cystatin C (hCC-stab1), dimerization was abrogated due to clasping of the β-strands from the swapping domains by an engineered disulfide bridge. We have designed and constructed another mutated cystatin C with the smallest possible structural intervention, that is a single-point mutation replacing hydrophobic V57 from the L1 loop by polar asparagine, known as a stabilizer of a β-turn motif. V57N hCC mutant occurred to be stable in its monomeric form and crystallized as a monomer, revealing typical cystatin fold with a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet wrapped around an α-helix.

However, increased utilization of computational platforms, and integration of information from less traditional NMR techniques with data from other complementary biophysical methods, promises to extend the boundary of NMR-applicable targets. This article reviews several of the techniques capable of providing less traditional and complementary structural information. In particular, the use of orientational constraints coming from residual dipolar couplings and residual chemical shift anisotropy offsets are shown to simplify the construction of models for oligomeric complexes, especially in cases of weak homo-dimers. Combining this orientational information with interaction site information supplied by computation, chemical shift perturbation, paramagnetic surface perturbation, cross-saturation and mass spectrometry allows high resolution models of the complexes to be constructed with relative ease. Non-NMR techniques, such as mass spectrometry, EPR and small angle X-ray scattering, are also expected to play increasingly important roles by offering alternative methods of probing the overall shape of the complex. Computational platforms capable of integrating information from multiple sources in the modeling process are also discussed in the article.

While at physiological conditions DNA strands repel each other, the presence of polyvalent cations such as spermine and spermidine in solutions leads to the formation of DNA condensates. In this study, we discuss packaging of DNA into bacteriophages P4 and Lambda under repulsive and attractive conditions using a coarse-grained model of DNA and capsids. Packaging under repulsive conditions leads to the appearance of the coaxial spooling conformations; DNA occupies all available space inside the capsid. Under the attractive potential both packed systems reveal toroidal conformations, leaving the central part of the capsids empty. We also present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of packaging and show that the forces required to pack the genomes in the presence of polyamines are significantly lower than those observed under repulsive conditions. The analysis reveals that in both the repulsive and attractive regimes the entropic penalty of DNA confinement has a significant non-negligible contribution into the total energy of packaging. Additionally we report the results of simulations of DNA condensation inside partially packed Lambda. We found that at low densities DNA behaves as free unconfined polymer and condenses into the toroidal structures; at higher densities rearrangement of the genome into toroids becomes hindered, and condensation results in the formation of non-equilibrium structures. In all cases packaging in a specific conformation occurs as a result of interplay between bending stresses experienced by the confined polymer and interactions between the strands.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The present study describes the effect of the phosphorylation of a single site on the full-length native porcine amelogenin P173 on self-assembly and on the regulation of spontaneous calcium phosphate formation in vitro. Studies were also conducted using recombinant non-phosphorylated (rP172) porcine amelogenin, along with the most abundant amelogenin cleavage product (P148) and its recombinant form (rP147). Amelogenin self-assembly was assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using these approaches, we have shown that self-assembly of each amelogenin is very sensitive to pH and appears to be affected by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, our results suggest that the phosphorylation of the full-length porcine amelogenin P173 has a small but potentially important effect on its higher-order self-assembly into chain-like structures under physiological conditions of pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Although phosphorylation has a subtle effect on the higher-order assembly of full-length amelogenin, native phosphorylated P173 was found to stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate for extended periods of time, in sharp contrast to previous findings using non-phosphorylated rP172.

Establishing correspondence between particles in a sequence of frames with high particle density, particles merging and splitting, particles entering and exiting the frame, temporary particle disappearance, and an ill-performing detection algorithm is the most challenging part of MPT. Here we propose a tracking method based on multidimensional assignment to address these problems. We combine an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter, multidimensional assignment, particle occlusion handling, and merge-split event detection in a single software analysis package. The main advantage of a multidimensional assignment is that both spatial and temporal information can be used by using several later frames as reference. The IMM filter, which is used to maintain and predict the state of each track, contains several models which correspond to different types of biologically realistic movements. It works especially well with multidimensional assignment, because there tends to be a higher probability of correct particle association over time. First the method generates many particle-correspondence hypotheses, merge-split hypotheses and misdetection hypotheses within the framework of a sliding window over the frames of the image sequence. Then it builds a multidimensional assignment problem (MAP) accordingly. The particle is tracked with gap-filling, and merging and splitting events are then detected using the MAP solution. The tracking method is validated on both simulated tracks and microscopy image sequences. The results of these experiments show that the method is more accurate and robust than other ""tracking from detected features"" methods in dense particle situations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Measurements from negative staining revealed that the filaments were up to 2600nm in length, with a width of 13.7nm and a long gentle helical periodicity of 42.9nm along the filament axis. Using rapid freezing and freeze-drying, it was possible to show that the filaments consist of two protein chains wrapped around each other. The possibility that these protein filaments generate a scaffold upon which viral DNA replication, recombination, and encapsidation occur in the infected cell nucleus is discussed.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The Pdr5p family of fungal transporters possesses a number of structural features significantly different from other modeled or crystallized ABC transporters, which include a reverse topology, an atypical ATP-binding site, a very low sequence similarity in the transmembrane section and long linkers between domains. These features present a considerable hurdle in molecular modeling studies of these important transporters. Here, we report the creation of an atomic model of Pdr5p based on a combination of homology modeling and ab initio methods, incorporating information from consensus transmembrane segment prediction, residue lipophilicity, and sequence entropy. Reported mutations in the transmembrane substrate-binding pocket that altered drug-resistance were used to validate the model, and one mutation that changed the communication pattern between transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains was used in model improvement. The predictive power of the model was demonstrated experimentally by the increased sensitivity of yeast mutants to clotrimazole having alanine substitutions for Thr1213 and Gln1253, which are predicted to be in the substrate-binding pocket, without reducing the amount of Pdr5p in the plasma membrane. The quality and reliability of our model are discussed in the context of various approaches used for modeling different parts of the structure.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

This technology now provides improved opportunities for modelling by mapping structural details of functional complexes in solution. The structure of proteins or protein complexes is ascertained by identifying amino acid pairs that are positioned in close proximity to each other. The validity of this technique has recently been benchmarked for large multi-protein complexes, by comparing cross-link data with that from a crystal structure of RNA polymerase II. Here, the specific nature of this cross-linking data will be discussed to assess the technical challenges and opportunities for model building.

However, high-resolution structures are difficult to obtain due to uncertainty in the spin label location and sparseness of experimental data. Here, we introduce RosettaEPR, which has been designed to improve de novo high-resolution protein structure prediction using sparse SDSL-EPR distance data. The ""motion-on-a-cone"" spin label model is converted into a knowledge-based potential, which was implemented as a scoring term in Rosetta. RosettaEPR increased the fractions of correctly folded models ( [Formula: see text] <7.5Å) and models accurate at medium resolution ( [Formula: see text] <3.5Å) by 25%. The correlation of score and model quality increased from 0.42 when using no restraints to 0.51 when using bounded restraints and again to 0.62 when using RosettaEPR. This allowed for the selection of accurate models by score. After full-atom refinement, RosettaEPR yielded a 1.7Å model of T4-lysozyme, thus indicating that atomic detail models can be achieved by combining sparse EPR data with Rosetta. While these results indicate RosettaEPR's potential utility in high-resolution protein structure prediction, they are based on a single example.

In this study we analyzed the position of the cell cycle regulator gene p21 within the CT of human chromosome 6 (HSA6) upon transcriptional activation. Whereas the majority of active p21 genes is located in the interior of the CT of HSA6, induction of p21 transcription correlates with increased variation of gene localization within the CT and with a higher percentage of p21 genes located at the periphery of the CT. Additionally it demonstrates once more that transcription can take place throughout CTs. Comparison of the p21 locus with two non-coding regions on HSA6 showed that both non-coding sequences are located more frequently in the interior of the CT than p21 genes although they are situated in chromosomal neighborhoods with widely differing gene density and regional transcriptional activity. Thus our data support models describing an influence of the transcriptional activity of a gene on the localization within its CT. However, our data also indicate that additional factors such as chromatin remodeling are implicated in the positioning of genes within the respective chromosome territory.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Closely related to the tumor suppressor gene DCC, neogenin functions in critical biological processes through binding to various ligands, including netrin, repulsive guidance molecules, and the iron regulatory protein hemojuvelin. We previously reported that neogenin binds to hemojuvelin through its membrane-proximal fifth and sixth FNIII domains (FN5-6), with domain 6 (FN6) contributing the majority of critical binding interactions. Here we present the crystal structure of FN5-6, the hemojuvelin-binding fragment of human neogenin, at 1.8Å. The two FNIII domains are orientated nearly linearly, a domain arrangement most similar to that of a tandem FNIII-containing fragment within the cytoplasmic tail of the β4 integrin. By mapping surface-exposed residues that differ between neogenin FN5-6 and the comparable domains from DCC, which does not bind hemojuvelin, we identified a potential hemojuvelin-binding site on neogenin FN6. Neogenin FN5, which does not bind hemojuvelin in isolation, exhibits a highly electropositive surface, which may be involved in interactions with negatively-charged polysaccharides or phospholipids in the membrane bilayer. The neogenin FN5-6 structure can be used to facilitate a molecular understanding of neogenin's interaction with hemojuvelin to regulate iron homeostasis and with hemojuvelin-related repulsive guidance molecules to mediate axon guidance.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of S. typhimurium 2-MCS (StPrpC) at 2.4Å resolution and its functional characterization. StPrpC was found to utilize propionyl-CoA more efficiently than acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA. The polypeptide fold and the catalytic residues of StPrpC are conserved in citrate synthases (CSs) suggesting similarities in their functional mechanisms. In the triclinic P1 cell, StPrpC molecules were organized as decamers composed of five identical dimer units. In solution, StPrpC was in a dimeric form at low concentrations and was converted to larger oligomers at higher concentrations. CSs are usually dimeric proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, a hexameric form, believed to be important for regulation of activity by NADH, is also observed. Structural comparisons with hexameric E. coli CS suggested that the key residues involved in NADH binding are not conserved in StPrpC. Structural comparison with the ligand free and bound states of CSs showed that StPrpC is in a nearly closed conformation despite the absence of bound ligands. It was found that the Tyr197 and Leu324 of StPrpC are structurally equivalent to the ligand binding residues His and Val, respectively, of CSs.

Although leptospires were identified as the causal agent of leptospirosis almost 100 years ago, little is known about their biology, which hinders the development of new treatment and prevention strategies. One of the several aspects of the leptospiral biology not yet elucidated is the process by which outer membrane proteins (OMPs) traverse the periplasm and are inserted into the outer membrane. The crystal structure determination of the conserved hypothetical protein LIC12922 from Leptospira interrogans revealed a two domain protein homologous to the Escherichia coli periplasmic chaperone SurA. The LIC12922 NC-domain is structurally related to the chaperone modules of E. coli SurA and trigger factor, whereas the parvulin domain is devoid of peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. Phylogenetic analyses suggest a relationship between LIC12922 and the chaperones PrsA, PpiD and SurA. Based on our structural and evolutionary analyses, we postulate that LIC12922 is a periplasmic chaperone involved in OMPs biogenesis in Leptospira spp. Since LIC12922 homologs were identified in all spirochetal genomes sequenced to date, this assumption may have implications for the OMPs biogenesis studies not only in leptospires but in the entire Phylum Spirochaetes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

These organisms exhibit many unusual features including a unique and essential U-insertion/deletion RNA editing process in their single mitochondrion. Many key RNA editing steps occur in ∼20S editosomes, which have a core of 12 proteins. Among these, the ""interaction protein"" KREPA6 performs a central role in maintaining the integrity of the editosome core and also binds to ssRNA. The use of llama single domain antibodies (VHH domains) accelerated crystal growth of KREPA6 from Trypanosoma brucei dramatically. All three structures obtained are heterotetramers with a KREPA6 dimer in the center, and one VHH domain bound to each KREPA6 subunit. Two of the resultant heterotetramers use complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2) and framework residues to form a parallel pair of beta strands with KREPA6 - a mode of interaction not seen before in VHH domain-protein antigen complexes. The third type of VHH domain binds in a totally different manner to KREPA6. Intriguingly, while KREPA6 forms tetramers in solution adding either one of the three VHH domains results in the formation of a heterotetramer in solution, in perfect agreement with the crystal structures. Biochemical solution studies indicate that the C-terminal tail of KREPA6 is involved in the dimerization of KREPA6 dimers to form tetramers.

Several classes of small molecules can bind to TTR delaying its amyloid fibril formation, thus being promising drug candidates to treat TTR amyloidoses. In the present study, we characterized the interactions of the synthetic triiodo L-thyronine analogs and thyroid hormone nuclear receptor TRβ-selective agonists GC-1 and GC-24 with the wild type and V30M variant of human transthyretin (TTR). To achieve this aim, we conducted in vitro TTR acid-mediated aggregation and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments and determined the TTR:GC-1 and TTR:GC-24 crystal structures.

The identified tunnel-intersecting residues permitted the subsequent construction of gating models via the identification of intra-protein interactions. We define 28 two-state gating models and 37 singlet gating-residue models. Our results reveal the preponderance of aromatic gating residues in CYP3A4 and CYP2A6, whereas we find a preponderance of polar/charged residues in CYP2C5. In CYP2C8 there is balanced presence of polar/charged and hydrophobic aliphatic residues in gating models, whilst in CYP2C9 there is balanced presence of all residue-types. These patterns suggest fast evolutionary dynamics for gating residues and we find that the average rate of evolution of gating residues in CYP2C5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 is significantly faster than the average rate of evolution of the entire sequence. Our study identifies 67% of calculable gating models identified in the literature by molecular dynamics approaches and 92% of residues appearing in literature models appear in our models. However, only 6% of the models identified in this work had been previously-described in the literature.

Methods for modeling assembly structures from individual components frequently suffer from large errors, due to protein flexibility and inaccurate scoring functions. However, when additional information is available, it may be possible to reduce the errors and compute near-native complex structures. One such type of information is a small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profile that can be collected in a high-throughput fashion from a small amount of sample in solution. Here, we present an efficient method for protein-protein docking with a SAXS profile (FoXSDock): generation of complex models by rigid global docking with PatchDock, filtering of the models based on the SAXS profile, clustering of the models, and refining the interface by flexible docking with FireDock. FoXSDock is benchmarked on 124 protein complexes with simulated SAXS profiles, as well as on 6 complexes with experimentally determined SAXS profiles. When induced fit is less than 1.5Å interface C(α) RMSD and the fraction residues of missing from the component structures is less than 3%, FoXSDock can find a model close to the native structure within the top 10 predictions in 77% of the cases; in comparison, docking alone succeeds in only 34% of the cases. Thus, the integrative approach significantly improves on molecular docking alone. The improvement arises from an increased resolution of rigid docking sampling and more accurate scoring.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In this paper we show by the method of molecular dynamics simulation that the transition between conformational substates of MutT is a key mechanism for a high-resolution molecular recognition of the differences between the very similar chemical compounds. (1) The native state MutT has two conformational substates with similar free energies, each characterized by either open or closed of two loops surrounding the substrate binding active site. Between the two substates, the open substate is more stable in free MutT and in dGMP-MutT complex, and the closed substate is more stable in 8-oxo-dGMP-MutT complex. (2) Conformational fluctuation of the open substate is much larger than that of the closed substate. An estimate of associated entropy difference was found to be consistent with the experimentally found difference of entropy contribution to the binding free energies of the two molecules. (3) A hydrogen bond between H7 atom of 8-oxo-dGMP and the sidechain of Asn119 plays a crucial role for maintaining the closed substate in 8-oxo-dGMP-MutT complex. When this hydrogen bond is absent in the H7-deficient dGMP-MutT complex, the closed substate is no more maintained and transition to the more entropically-favored open substate is induced. (4) Thus, this mechanism of the hydrogen bond controlling the relative stabilities of the drastically different two conformational substates enhances the resolution to recognize the small difference of the chemical structures between the two molecules, dGMP and 8-oxo-dGMP.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, cellohexaose and laminaribiose are not hydrolyzed by the mutant and instead exhibit competitive inhibition. The structures of the BGlu1 E176Q, its complexes with cellotetraose, cellopentaose and laminaribiose, and its covalent intermediate with 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside were determined at 1.65, 1.95, 1.80, 2.80, and 1.90Å resolution, respectively. The Q176Nε was found to hydrogen bond to the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond, thereby explaining its high activity. The enzyme interacts with cellooligosaccharides through direct hydrogen bonds to the nonreducing terminal glucosyl residue. However, interaction with the other glucosyl residues is predominantly mediated through water molecules, with the exception of a direct hydrogen bond from N245 to glucosyl residue 3, consistent with the apparent high binding energy at this residue. Hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic sidechain of W358 appear to orient glucosyl residues 2 and 3, while Y341 orients glucosyl residues 4 and 5. In contrast, laminaribiose has its second glucosyl residue positioned to allow direct hydrogen bonding between its O2 and Q176 Oε and O1 and N245.

A statistical mechanics analysis assesses the complexity of a structure calculation globally in terms of ensemble properties. Analogs of the free energy and density of states are introduced; partition functions evaluate the consistency of prior assumptions with data. Critical behavior is observed with dwindling restraint density, which impairs structure determination with too sparse data.

X-ray diffraction studies have established that similar filaments exist in the hard keratins of crocodiles, turtles, tuataras, lizards and snakes. Here, the relationship between amino acid sequence and the filament-matrix texture is explored in a wide variety of avian and reptilian hard keratins. Universally, the molecules contain three distinct domains: a central domain rich in β-favoring residues associated with the filament framework, and N- and C-terminal domains associated with the matrix and with crosslinking via disulfide bonds. A variety of structural probes were employed to identify the β-framework of the filaments and a common pattern 34 residues in length was found in all cases. In addition, detailed analyses of the sequences in the two ""matrix"" domains revealed profound differences between the Archosaurs (birds, crocodiles and turtles), where the N-terminal domains were very similar, and the Squamates (snakes and lizards) where the N-terminal domains varied widely in length and composition, in some cases exhibiting a subdomain structure, and segments of highly homologous sequence. The C-terminal domains in both branches varied widely in composition but almost all exhibit a subdomain structure characterized by a terminal sequence rich in cysteine and arginine residues. A revised model for the molecular organization in avian and reptilian hard keratins is presented and similarities and differences in the matrix domains are noted.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Similar structures are also the molecular principle of the infectious spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and of the so-called yeast prions, inherited non-chromosomal elements found in yeast and fungi. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is often used to delineate the assembly mechanism and structural properties of amyloid aggregates. In this review we consider specifically contributions and limitations of STEM for the investigation of amyloid assembly pathways, fibril polymorphisms and structural models of amyloid fibrils. This type of microscopy provides the only method to directly measure the mass-per-length (MPL) of individual filaments. Made on both in vitro assembled and ex vivo samples, STEM mass measurements have illuminated the hierarchical relationships between amyloid fibrils and revealed that polymorphic fibrils and various globular oligomers can assemble simultaneously from a single polypeptide. The MPLs also impose strong constraints on possible packing schemes, assisting in molecular model building when combined with high-resolution methods like solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Previous studies of this deformation have been focused at the cellular level where considerable compression occurs, yet the degree of possible intracellular macromolecular deformation has remained unclear. Here, electron cryo-tomographic reconstructions of vitreous cryo-sections show that 80S ribosomes, both intracellular and in an isolated state, appear able to resist section-induced compression. Our observations indicate that vitreous section-induced compression is non-uniform between whole cells that have been sectioned and their intracellular macromolecular complexes.

Single-particle reconstructions of such assemblies have been growing rapidly in recent years, providing increasingly high resolution structural information under native conditions. While the static structure of these assemblies provides essential insight into their mechanism of biological function, their dynamical motions provide additional important information that cannot be inferred from structure alone. Here we present an unsupervised computational framework for the analysis of high molecular weight protein assemblies and use it to analyze the conformational dynamics of structures deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. Protein assemblies are modeled using a recently introduced coarse-grained modeling framework based on the finite element method, which is used to compute equilibrium thermal fluctuations, elastic strain energy distributions associated with specific conformational transitions, and dynamical correlations in distant molecular domains. Results are presented in detail for the ribosome-bound termination factor RF2 from Escherichia coli, the nuclear pore complex from Dictyostelium discoideum, and the chaperonin GroEL from E. coli. Elastic strain energy distributions reveal hinge-regions associated with specific conformational change pathways, and correlations in collective molecular motions reveal dynamical coupling between distant molecular domains that suggest new, as well as confirm existing, allosteric mechanisms.

Many computational docking strategies exist for finding the geometric transformations that superimpose maps, but the problem of finding an optimal density transformation, for the purposes of difference calculations or segmentation, has received little attention in the literature. We report results based on simulated and experimental electron microscopy maps, showing that a single scale factor (gain) may be insufficient when it comes to minimizing the density discrepancy between an aligned target and probe. We propose an affine transformation, with gain and bias, that is parameterized by known surface isovalues and by an interactive centering of the ""cancellation peak"" in the surface thresholded difference map histogram. The proposed approach minimizes discrepancies across a wide range of interior densities. Owing to having only two parameters, it avoids overfitting and requires only minimal knowledge of the probe and target maps. The linear transformation also preserves phases and relative amplitudes in Fourier space.

Here we report the crystal structures of two analogous dipeptidyl inhibitor complexes which inhibit human cathepsin L in reversible and irreversible modes, respectively. To-date, there are no crystal structure reports of complexes of proteases with their glyoxal inhibitors or complexes of cathepsin L and their diazomethylketone inhibitors. These two inhibitors - inhibitor 1, an α-keto-β-aldehyde and inhibitor 2, a diazomethylketone, have different groups in the S1 subsite. Inhibitor 1 [Z-Phe-Tyr (OBut)-COCHO], with a K(i) of 0.6nM, is the most potent, reversible, synthetic peptidyl inhibitor of cathepsin L reported to-date. The structure of the inhibitor 1 complex was refined up to 2.2Å resolution. The structure of the complex of the inhibitor 2 [Z-Phe-Tyr (t-Bu)-diazomethylketone], an irreversible inhibitor that can inactivate cathepsin L at μM concentrations, was refined up to 1.76Å resolution. These two inhibitors have substrate-like interactions with the active site cysteine (Cys25). Inhibitor 1 forms a tetrahedral hemithioacetal adduct, whereas the inhibitor 2 forms a thioester with Cys25. The inhibitor 1 β-aldehyde group is shown to make a hydrogen bond with catalytic His163, whereas the ketone carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor 2 interacts with the oxyanion hole. tert-Butyl groups of both inhibitors are found to make several non-polar contacts with S' subsite residues of cathepsin L.

Ligand docking and ranking techniques show considerable promise in their ability to quantify the interactions between proteins and small molecules. Despite the advances in the development of docking approaches and scoring functions, the genome-wide application of many ligand docking/screening algorithms is limited by the quality of the binding sites in theoretical receptor models constructed by protein structure prediction. In this study, we describe a new template-based method for the local refinement of ligand-binding regions in protein models using remotely related templates identified by threading. We designed a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model that selects correct binding site geometries in a large ensemble of multiple receptor conformations. The SVR model employs several scoring functions that impose geometrical restraints on the Cα positions, account for the specific chemical environment within a binding site and optimize the interactions with putative ligands. The SVR score is well correlated with the RMSD from the native structure; in 47% (70%) of the cases, the Pearson's correlation coefficient is >0.5 (>0.3). When applied to weakly homologous models, the average heavy atom, local RMSD from the native structure of the top-ranked (best of top five) binding site geometries is 3.1Å (2.9Å) for roughly half of the targets; this represents a 0.1 (0.3)Å average improvement over the original predicted structure. Focusing on the subset of strongly conserved residues, the average heavy atom RMSD is 2.6Å (2.3Å). Furthermore, we estimate the upper bound of template-based binding site refinement using only weakly related proteins to be ∼2.6Å RMSD. This value also corresponds to the plasticity of the ligand-binding regions in distant homologues.

First, tests were performed radially along straight lines running across highly mineralized peritubular dentin sections and through less mineralized intertubular dentin areas. These tests revealed a gradual decrease in Young's modulus from the bulk of the peritubular dentin region where modulus values of up to ∼40-42GPa were observed, down to approximately constant values of ∼17GPa in the intertubular dentin region. A second set of nano-indentation experiments was performed on the facets of an irregular polyhedron specimen cut from the intertubular dentin region, so as to probe the modulus of intertubular dentin specimens at different orientations relative to the tubular direction. The results demonstrated that the intertubular dentin region may be considered to be quasi-isotropic, with a slightly higher modulus value (∼22GPa) when the indenting tip axis is parallel to the tubular direction, compared to the values (∼18GPa) obtained when the indenting tip axis is perpendicular to the tubule direction.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we present a simple, fast and well-documented method for the calculation and visualization of PSs from PDB-coordinate files of membrane proteins: the projection structure visualization (PSV)-method. The PSV-method was successfully validated using the PS of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) from 2D crystals and cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and the PDB-coordinate file of AQP1 determined from 3D crystals and X-ray crystallography. Besides AQP1, which is a relatively rigid protein, we also studied a flexible membrane transport protein, i.e. the L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC. Comparison of PSs calculated from the existing PDB-coordinate files of substrate-free and L-arginine-bound AdiC indicated that conformational changes are detected in projection. Importantly, structural differences were found between the PSV-method calculated PSs of the detergent-solubilized AdiC proteins and the PS from cryo-TEM of membrane-embedded AdiC.

Previous studies indicate that cross-linking molecules might fulfill these stabilizing tasks, which in addition facilitates their ability to regulate the organization of cytoskeletal structures in vivo. The effect of depolymerization factors on such structures or the mechanism which leads finally to their disintegration remain unknown. Here, we use multiple depolymerization methods in order to directly demonstrate that cross-linking and bundling proteins effectively suppress the actin depolymerization in a concentration dependent manner. Even the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin is not sufficient to facilitate a fast disintegration of highly cross-linked actin networks unless molecular motors are used simultaneously.

During cryoEM studies of actin labelled with myosin V, we have found it necessary to work with lacey grids rather than Quantifoil or C-flat grids due to interaction of myosin V with the support film. Lacey grids have irregular holes of variable shape and size, in contrast to Quantifoil or C-flat grids which have a regular array of similar circular holes on each grid square.

Sequence alignment revealed that one specific region in PufX may be essential for PufX-induced core dimerization. In this region of ten amino acids in length all Rhodobacter species had five conserved amino acids, with the exception of Rb. veldkampii. Our findings provide direct evidence that the presence of PufX in Rb. veldkampii does not directly govern the dimerization of LH1-RC core complexes in the native membrane.

The results indicate that the releasing paths are related to the local motions of three loops: L3 (Val39-Gln42), L7 (Thr75-Thr79) and L9 (Asn97-Leu100). The major obstacles to Chr releasing come from steric hindrance, direct hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions formed by the three loops, and Ser98 is an important residue in the releasing process. The most favorable direction of releasing is almost parallel to the connection between L7 and L3. Releasing from the direction, Chr only needs to break three hydrogen bonds from Ser98 and Pro76 and the weakest steric hindrance.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we present the crystal structure of a cold-adapted Fe-SOD from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhSOD), and that of its complex with sodium azide. The structures were compared with those of the corresponding homologues having a high sequence identity with PhSOD, such as the mesophilic SOD from Escherichia coli (EcSOD) or Pseudomonas ovalis, and the psychrophilic SOD from Aliivibrio salmonicida (AsSOD). These enzymes shared a large structural similarity, such as a conserved tertiary structure and arrangement of the two monomers, an almost identical total number of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. However, the two cold-adapted SODs showed an increased flexibility of the active site residues with respect to their mesophilic homologues. Structural information was combined with a characterisation of the chemical and thermal stability performed by CD and fluorescence measurements. Despite of its psychrophilic origin, the denaturation temperature of PhSOD was comparable with that of the mesophilic EcSOD, whereas AsSOD showed a lower denaturation temperature. On the contrary, the values of the denaturant concentration at the transition midpoint were in line with the psychrophilic/mesophilic origin of the proteins. These data provide additional support to the hypothesis that cold-adapted enzymes achieve efficient catalysis at low temperature, by increasing the flexibility of their active site; moreover, our results underline how fine structural modifications can alter enzyme flexibility and/or stability without compromising the overall structure of typical rigid enzymes, such as SODs.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Trichokeratin intermediate filaments (IFs) from the ortho-, para- and mesocortices were modeled from the tomograms. IFs were predominantly arranged in left-handed concentric helices with the relative angle of IFs increasing progressively from the center to the periphery of orthocortex macrofibrils. The median increase in IF angle between adjacent IFs between the center and periphery was 2.5°. The length of one turn of the helical path of an IF was calculated to be approximately 1μm for an IF tilted at 30° and positioned 100nm from the macrofibril center. With the exception of one paracortex macrofibril that weakly resembled an orthocortex macrofibril, all para- and mesocortex macrofibrils modeled had a parallel arrangement of the IFs, with a more ordered arrangement found in the mesocortex. Within the limited sample set, there appeared to be no significant relationship between IF angle and fiber curvature. We examined the matrix/IF ratio (in the form of proportion of matrix to one IF, calculated from IF center-to-center distance and IF diameter) for 28 macrofibrils used for modeling. The proportion of matrix was significantly different in the different cortex cell types, with paracortex having the most (0.61), orthocortex having the least (0.42), and mesocortex being intermediate (0.54). Fibers of different crimp type (high, medium or low crimp) were not significantly different from each other with respect to matrix proportion.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

To observe them in open environment, we have developed an inverted scanning electron microscope with a detachable, open-culture dish, capable of 8 nm resolution, and combined with a fluorescence microscope quasi-simultaneously observing the same area from the top. For scanning electron microscopy from the bottom, a silicon nitride film window in the base of the dish maintains a vacuum between electron gun and open sample dish while allowing electrons to pass through. Electrons are backscattered from the sample and captured by a detector under the dish. Cells cultured on the open dish can be externally manipulated under optical microscopy, fixed, and observed using scanning electron microscopy. Once fine structures have been revealed by scanning electron microscopy, their component proteins may be identified by comparison with separately prepared fluorescence-labeled optical microscopic images of the candidate proteins, with their heavy-metal-labeled or stained ASEM images. Furthermore, cell nuclei in a tissue block stained with platinum-blue were successfully observed without thin-sectioning, which suggests the applicability of this inverted scanning electron microscope to cancer diagnosis.

Here we present a three-dimensional (3D) maximum likelihood algorithm--MLTOMO--which is characterized by integrating 3D alignment and classification into a single, unified processing step. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we calculate the probability of observing an individual sub-tomogram for a given reference structure. We assume that the reference structure is affected by a 'compound wedge', resulting from the summation of many individual missing wedges in distinct orientations. The distance metric underlying our probability calculations effectively down-weights Fourier components that are observed less frequently. Simulations demonstrate that MLTOMO clearly outperforms the 'constrained correlation' approach and has advantages over existing approaches in cases where the sub-tomograms adopt preferred orientations. Application of our approach to cryo-electron tomographic data of ice-embedded thermosomes revealed distinct conformations that are in good agreement with results obtained by previous single particle studies.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

They share some common feature with the organic matrix layers between the aragonite tablets in the nacre and the periostracum, and show similarities to the myostracum. Thus, although the green sheet is reported to be unique to the abalone shell, it represents an interesting model for the study of molluscan shell biomineralization processes. Indeed, during shell formation, prismatic and spherulitic aragonite precedes and follows the deposition of the interstitial green polymeric composite sheets, and there is evidence to suggest that these sheets demark the interruption of nacre synthesis and serve to nucleate the resumption of calcium carbonate crystal growth. The green polymeric interstitial sheet purified from the abalone shell was investigated by spectroscopic and imaging techniques: FTIR, confocal microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and by pyrolysis combined with GC-MS. Structural and compositional differences are observed between the surfaces of the two sides of the interstitial polymeric composite sheets. Moreover, comparative crystallization experiments on the green sheet sides also reveal asymmetry with respect to the nucleation of calcium carbonate. These findings suggest that these bifacially differentiated interstitial composites may play an active role in the mineral assembly processes, with one of the surfaces acting as a crystal nucleator.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Due to the complexity of bone structure and the number of diseases which affect the ultrastructural constituents of bone, it is important to develop quantitative methods to assess bone nanoscale properties. Autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta results predominantly from glycine substitutions (80%) and splice site mutations (20%) in the genes encoding the α1 or α2 chains of Type I collagen. Genotype-phenotype correlations using over 830 collagen mutations have revealed that lethal mutations are located in regions crucial for collagen-ligand binding in the matrix. However, few of these correlations have been extended to collagen structure in bone. Here, an atomic force microscopy-based approach was used to image and quantitatively analyze the D-periodic spacing of Type I collagen fibrils in femora from heterozygous (Brtl/+) mice (α1(I)G349C), compared to wild type (WT) littermates. This disease system has a well-defined change in the col1α1 allele, leading to a well characterized alteration in collagen protein structure, which are directly related to altered Type I collagen nanoscale morphology, as measured by the D-periodic spacing. In Brtl/+ bone, the D-periodic spacing shows significantly greater variability on average and along the length of the bone compared to WT, although the average spacing was unchanged. Brtl/+ bone also had a significant difference in the population distribution of collagen D-period spacings. These changes may be due to the mutant collagen structure, or to the heterogeneity of collagen monomers in the Brtl/+ matrix. These observations at the nanoscale level provide insight into the structural basis for changes present in bone composition, geometry and mechanical integrity in Brtl/+ bones. Further studies are necessary to link these morphological observations to nanoscale mechanical integrity.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

For this to be successful requires that large changes in structure are relatively rare in evolution and that proteins with no detectable evolutionary relationship do not converge on similar global chain conformations since this creates conflicts between structural and evolutionary consistency. Analysis of global structural changes using core topological descriptions for 4261 domains from classes C and D of the SCOP database and new measures of topological distance and consistency of classification showed that the topological consistency of SCOP folds is highly variable with some folds having no consistent description and significant overlaps between groups including some members of separate folds with identical topological descriptions. Topological clustering shows that including sufficient indels to allow family members to be joined would also require joining several distinct folds. We conclude that evolutionary changes in the global topology of protein domains are the root cause of many difficulties for present approaches to structure classification using pairwise comparison. As a resolution we propose that a purely structural classification should be created using an approach similar to that adopted by the Gene Ontology in which proteins are assigned labels describing structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This has galvanized researchers from across a broad range of biological and biomedical disciplines to study the form and function of thousands of proteins. This task can be achieved by production of stable and pure proteins for their biophysical and biochemical analysis and/or for their 3D structure determination. The broad hierarchy of structures in biological systems necessitates integration of a wide range of high and low-resolution structural determination techniques. These include X-ray and neutron crystallography, NMR, electron microscopy and tomography, small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, mass spectroscopy and advanced light microscopy techniques. Common to all these techniques is the requirement for highly pure protein samples. Consequently, high throughput protein expression and purification, as well as more versatile expression systems and techniques, are now in even greater demand to support the pressing requirements of the research pipeline. However, protein expression is not only a technology, but also an art. Each protein is unique and thus requires special and often tedious treatment. Therefore, the expression of high levels of stable and functional proteins remains a bottleneck in many scientific endeavors, including the determination of structures in a high-throughput fashion or the screening for novel active compounds in modern drug discovery. Recently, numerous developments have substantially improved the procedures for production of soluble and active proteins in heterologous expression systems. These include parallel construct design, new and more robust expression systems, modifications to the expression constructs, introduction of new and/or improved prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and the development of improved cell-free protein synthesis systems. This has driven technological developments striving for miniaturization and automation, and methods to characterize proteins prior to structural characterization, in order to achieve a better understanding of how to design constructs generating proteins more amenable to structural characterization.

Principal component analysis indicates that, for the three systems, the protein dynamics is mainly characterized by the motion of the matrix loops and of the odd-numbered helices having a conserved proline in their central region. Analysis of the motions shows a different behaviour of single pathological mutant with respect of the other two systems. The single mutation induces a regularization and rigidity of the H3 helix, lost upon the introduction of the second mutation. This is directly correlated to the salt bridge distribution involving residues Arg79, Asp134 and Arg234, hypothesized to interact with the substrate. In fact, in the wild type simulation two stable inter-helices salt bridges, crucial for substrate binding, are present almost over all the simulation time. In line with the impaired ADP transport, one salt interaction is lost in the single mutant trajectory but reappears in the double mutant simulation, where a salt bridge network matching the wild type is restored.

In most cases, the 6X-His-tagged proteins are sufficiently purified (>97% homogeneity) using a HTP two-step purification protocol for most structural studies.

Cholesterol cochleate cylinders are formed in larger numbers at intermediate temperatures (40-75°C) but are not formed at 100°C.

The bound D4 domain forms a linear array on the two planar surfaces and edges of the cholesterol microcrystals and a quasi helical array on the surface of the cochleate cylinders. Little evidence has been obtained to support the possibility that interaction or hetero-oligomerization can occur between intact pyolysin and the pyolysin D4 fragment on the surface of cholesterol microcrystals.

Previous studies have shown that a universally conserved SRP RNA facilitates an efficient SRP-SR interaction in the presence of a signal sequence bound to SRP. However, a remarkable exception has been found in chloroplast SRP (cpSRP) pathway, in which the SRP RNA is missing. Based on biochemical and structural analyses, it is proposed that free cpSRP receptor (cpFtsY) has already been preorganized into a closed state for efficient cpSRP-cpFtsY association. However, no direct evidence has been reported to support this postulation thus far. In this study, we characterized the structural dynamics of cpFtsY and its conformational rearrangements induced by GTP binding using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results showed that the GTP-binding event triggered substantial conformational changes in free cpFtsY, including the relative orientation of N-G domain and several conserved motifs that are critical in complex formation. These rearrangements enabled the cpFtsY to relax into a preorganized 'closed' state that favored the formation of a stable complex with cpSRP54. Interestingly, the intrinsic flexibility of αN1 helix facilitated these rearrangements. In addition, GTP binding in cpFtsY was mediated by conserved residues that have been shown in other SRP GTPases. These findings suggested that GTP-bound cpFtsY could fluctuate into conformations that are favorable to form the stable complex, providing explanation of why SRP-SR interaction bypasses the requirement of the SRP RNA at a molecular level.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

RING domains are involved in specific interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and thus play an essential role in the ubiquitination pathway. Protein production of the Zn(2+) containing and cysteine rich RING domains for molecular studies frequently turns out to be problematic. We compared the expression and solubility of 14 E3 RING/U-box domains fused to the N-terminal tags of His(6), His(6)-GB1, His(6)-Trx and His(6)-GST at small scale and analyzed, by NMR spectroscopy, their correct folding after purification. The addition of GST, Trx or GB1 to the N-terminal His(6) tag significantly improved both the expression and solubility of target proteins as compared to His(6) tag alone. More importantly most of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purified proteins were largely unfolded as judged by analysis of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra. We demonstrate that imidazole causes a concentration dependent decrease in stability of RING proteins ascribed to metal depletion and resulting in unfolding or precipitation. In contrast, using glutathione affinity chromatography, the His(6)-GST fused RING and U-box domains were purified as correctly folded proteins with high yields.

Three of the six xylose residues of xylohexaose are shown to be bound in the inactivated GH10 substrate binding cleft, with the other three sugars presumably disordered in the solvent channel. The protein is a dimer in the asymmetric unit with extensive surface contacts between the two GH10 modules and between the CBM22-1 and GH10 modules. Residues from helix H4 of the GH10 module provide the major contacts by fitting into the minor groove of the CBM22-1 module.

The extensions are comprised of thin filaments emerging from the central core.

In particular, the existence of a differentiated central core in calcareous spicules is still controversial. Here we combine high-spatial resolution analyses, including NanoSIMS, Raman, SXM, AFM, SEM and TEM to investigate the composition, mineralogy and ultrastructure of the giant tetractines of Leuconia johnstoniCarter, 1871 (Baeriidae, Calcaronea) and the organization of surrounding cells. A compositionally distinct core is present in these spicule types. The core measures 3.5-10 μm in diameter and is significantly depleted in Mg and lightly enriched in S compared with the adjacent outer layer in the spicule. Measured Mg/Ca ratios in the core range from 70 to 90 mmol/mol compared to 125-130 mmol/mol in the adjacent calcite envelope. However, this heterogeneous distribution of Mg and S is not reflected in the mineralogy and the microstructure. Raman spectroscopy demonstrates a purely calcitic mineralogy. SEM examination of slightly etched spicules indicates an ultrastructure organized hierarchically in a concentric pattern, with layers less than 250 nm in width inside layers averaging 535 ± 260 nm. No change in structural pattern corresponds to the Mg/Ca variation observed. AFM and TEM observations show a nanogranular organization of the spicules with a network of intraspicular organic material intercalated between nanograins 60-130 nm in diameter. Observations of sclerocyte cells in the process of spiculogenesis suggest that the compositionally distinct core is produced by a sub-apical sclerocyte ""founder cell"" that controls axial growth, while the envelope is secreted by lateral sclerocytes ""thickener cells"", which control radial growth.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Two variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were genetically combined with a self-assembly system having the remarkable opportunity to interact with each other and act as functional nanopatterning biocoating. The S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a was fused with the cyan ECFP donor protein at the SgsE N-terminus and with the yellow YFP acceptor protein at the C-terminus. The fluorescence energy transfer was studied with spectrofluorimetry, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, whilst protein self-assembly (on silicon dioxide particles) and structural investigations were carried out with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of reassembled SgsE tandem protein was 20.0 ± 6.1% which is almost the same transfer efficiency shown in solution (19.6 ± 0.1%).

This technique allows one to produce higher resolution images of structures which can not be reconstructed using single-particle methods. Building on previous work, we present a new dissimilarity measure between subtomograms that works well for the noisy images that often occur in CET images. A technique that is more robust to noise provides the ability to analyze macromolecules in thicker samples such as whole cells or lower the defocus in thinner samples to push the first zero of the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). Our method, Threshold Constrained Cross-Correlation (TCCC), uses statistics of the noise to automatically select only a small percentage of the Fourier coefficients to compute the cross-correlation, which has two main advantages: first, it reduces the influence of the noise by looking at only those peaks dominated by signal; and second, it avoids the missing wedge normalization problem since we consider the same number of coefficients for all possible pairs of subtomograms. We present results with synthetic and real data to compare our approach with other existing methods under different SNR and missing wedge conditions, and show that TCCC improves alignment results for datasets with SNR<0.1.

Similarities in daily strain histories might uncover a common basic mechanical stimulus for homeostatic bone maintenance, whereas dissimilarities might explain why bones respond differently to changes in their environment. We compared the daily strain histories of two different bones from the rabbit: the tibiofibula and the mandible. Bone strain was recorded wirelessly in freely moving animals up to 57 h. Habitual strain amplitudes, rates, and frequencies were compared. The exponential decrease in occurrence of greater strain amplitudes was similar in long and mandibular bone. Also similar was the exponentially decreasing incidence of higher strain rates. Mandibular-bone strains distinguished themselves from long-bone strains, however, through the presence of a plateau in the occurrence of compressive strains with amplitudes between 200 and 450 microstrain (με) and in the occurrence of compressive-strain rates between 5000 and 10,000 με/s. The frequency spectrum of the mandibular-bone strain history contained peaks at 4.4 Hz and 8.9 Hz, which were absent in the long-bone strain spectrum. We hypothesise that the exponentially decreasing incidence of larger strain amplitudes and rates might outline the minimum amount of mechanical stimuli needed for bone maintenance. Furthermore, the strong presence of rhythmicity in mandibular strains might provide an important clue in confirming or improving the anabolic character of cyclic-loading regimes employed in clinical settings.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Since bacteria with Cld play significant roles in the bioremediation of industrially contaminated sites and also in wastewater treatment, it is of high interest to understand the molecular mechanism of chlorite detoxification. Here we investigate a highly active Cld from Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii (NdCld), a key nitrifier in biological wastewater treatment, using a comprehensive structural, biochemical and bioinformatics approach. We determined the crystal structure of Cld from Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii and showed that functional NdCld is a homopentamer possessing a fold found in other Clds and Cld-like enzymes. To investigate the Cld function in more detail, site-directed mutagenesis of a catalytically important residue (Arg173) was performed and two enzyme mutants were structurally and biochemically characterized. Arginine 173 is demonstrated to play a key role in (i) controlling of ligand and substrate access and binding and (ii) in chlorite dismutation reaction. The flexible residue modulates the electrostatic potential and size of the active site entrance and might be involved in keeping transiently formed hypochlorite in place for final molecular oxygen and chloride formation. Furthermore, using a structure-based sequence alignment, we show that the residue corresponding to Arg173 is conserved in all known active forms of Cld and propose it as a marker for Cld activity in yet uncharacterized Cld-like proteins.

More recently, several fusion proteins containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and targeted to the secretory vesicles have been engineered. Both targeted fluorescent proteins and acidic dyes have been used, separately or combined, to monitor the dynamics of secretory vesicle movements and their fusion with the plasma membrane. We have now investigated in detail the degree of colocalization of both types of probes using several fusion proteins targeted to the vesicles (synaptobrevin2-EGFP, Cromogranin A-EGFP and neuropeptide Y-EGFP) and several acidic dyes (acridine orange, neutral red and lysotracker red) in chromaffin cells, PC12 cells and GH(3) cells. We find that all the acidic dyes labelled the same population of vesicles. However, that population was largely different from the one labelled by the targeted proteins, with very little colocalization among them, in all the cell types studied. Our data show that the vesicles containing the proteins more characteristic of the secretory vesicles are not labelled by the acidic dyes, and vice versa. Peptide glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) produced a rapid and selective disruption of the vesicles labelled by acidic dyes, suggesting that they could be mainly lysosomes. Therefore, these labelling techniques distinguish two clearly different sets of acidic vesicles in neuroendocrine cells.

Electron microscopy and tomographic reconstruction were used to investigate the three-dimensional structure of axonal mitochondria and mitochondria in the surrounding Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), both in the vicinity of nodes of Ranvier and far from these nodes. Condensed mitochondria were found to be abundant in the axoplasm, but not in the Schwann cell. Uncharacteristic of the classical morphology of condensed mitochondria, the outer and inner boundary membranes are in close apposition and the crista junctions are narrow, consistent with their function as gates for the diffusion of macromolecules. There is also less cristae surface area and lower density of crista junctions in these mitochondria. The density of mitochondria was greater at the paranode-node-paranode (PNP) as was the crista junction opening, yet there were fewer cristae in these organelles compared to those in the internodal region. The greater density of condensed mitochondria in the PNS axoplasm and in particular at the PNP suggests a need for these organelles to operate at a high workload of ATP production.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We present a novel feature-preserving non-local means approach to denoise such images to improve feature recovery and particle detection. The commonly used non-local means filter is not optimal for noisy biological images containing small features of interest because image noise prevents accurate determination of the correct coefficients for averaging, leading to over-smoothing and other artifacts. Our adaptive method addresses this problem by constructing a particle feature probability image, which is based on Haar-like feature extraction. The particle probability image is then used to improve the estimation of the correct coefficients for averaging. We show that this filter achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio in denoised images and has a greater capability in identifying weak particles when applied to synthetic data. We have applied this approach to live-cell images resulting in enhanced detection of end-binding-protein 1 foci on dynamically extending microtubules in photo-sensitive Drosophila tissues.

The published crystal structure of human Ku-DNA complex reveals a heterodimer that forms a ring around dsDNA by means of the Ku core modules. These modules contain a highly conserved seven-stranded β-barrel, which in turn contains an insertion, termed the bridge-region, between its second and third β-strands. The bridge-region adopts an unusual β-strand-rich structure critical for dsDNA-binding and Ku function, but its provenance remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the bridge-region of Ku is a novel member of the diverse Zn-ribbon fold group. Sequence analysis reveals that Ku from several Gram-positive bacteria and bacteriophages retain metal-chelating motifs, whereas they have been lost in the versions from most other organisms. Structural comparisons suggest that the Zn-ribbon from Ku-bridge-region is the first example of a circularly permuted, segment-swapped Zn-ribbon. This finding helps explain how Ku is likely to bind DNA as an obligate dimer. Further, we hypothesize that retention of the unusual conformation of the turns of the Zn-ribbons, despite loss of the Zn-binding sites, provides clues regarding the mechanism by which the Ku-bridge-regions sense the DNA state.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

A 2.7Å resolution crystal structure of a complex of Escherichia coli fimbrial proteins containing FimH, FimG, FimF, and FimC provides the most complete model to date for the arrangement of subunits assembled in the native structure. The first three proteins form the tip of the fimbriae while FimC is the chaperone protein involved in the usher/chaperone assembly process. The subunits interact through donor strand complementation where a β-strand from a subunit completes the β-sandwich structure of the neighboring subunit or domain closer to the tip of the fimbria. The function of FimC is to provide a surrogate donor strand before delivery of each subunit to the FimD usher and the growing fimbria. Comparison of the subunits in this structure and their chaperone-bound complexes show that the two FimH domains change their relative orientation and position in forming the tip structure. Also, the non-chaperone subunits undergo a conformational change in their first β-strand when the chaperone is replaced by the native donor strand. Some residues move as much as 14Å in the process. This structural shift has not been noted in structural studies of other bacterial adhesion sub-structures assembled via donor strand complementation. The domains undergo a significant structural change in the donor strand binding groove during fimbrial assembly, and this likely plays a role in determining the specificity of subunit-subunit interactions among the fimbrial proteins.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Fenestrations have significant roles in aging and the regulation of lipoproteins. However their small size (<200 nm) has prohibited any functional analysis by light microscopy. We employed structured illumination light microscopy to observe fenestrations in isolated rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells with great clarity and spatial resolution. With this method, the three-dimensional structure of fenestrations (diameter 123+/-24 nm) and sieve plates was elucidated and it was shown that fenestrations occur in areas of abrupt cytoplasmic thinning (165+/-54 nm vs. 292+/-103 nm in non-fenestrated regions, P<0.0001). Sieve plates were not preferentially co-localized with fluorescently labeled F-actin stress fibers and endothelial nitric oxide synthase but appeared to occur in primarily attenuated non-raft regions of the cell membrane. Labyrinthine structures were not seen and all fenestrations were short cylindrical pores. In conclusion, three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy has enabled the unlimited power of fluorescent immunostaining and co-localization to reveal new structural and functional information about fenestrations and sieve plates.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite extensive structural and biochemical studies, the molecular mechanism of substrate specificity for MTAN remains an outstanding question. Bacterial MTANs show comparable efficiency in hydrolyzing MTA and SAH, while the plant enzymes select preferentially for MTA, with either no or significantly reduced activity towards SAH. Bacterial and plant MTANs show significant conservation in the overall structure, and the adenine- and ribose-binding sites. The observation of a more constricted 5'-alkylthio binding site in Arabidopsis thalianaAtMTAN1 and AtMTAN2, two plant MTAN homologues, led to the hypothesis that steric hindrance may play a role in substrate selection in plant MTANs. We show using isothermal titration calorimetry that SAH binds to both Escherichia coli MTAN (EcMTAN) and AtMTAN1 with comparable micromolar affinity. To understand why AtMTAN1 can bind but not hydrolyze SAH, we determined the structure of the protein-SAH complex at 2.2Å resolution. The lack of catalytic activity appears to be related to the enzyme's inability to bind the substrate in a catalytically competent manner. The role of dynamics in substrate selection was also examined by probing the amide proton exchange rates of EcMTAN and AtMTAN1 via deuterium-hydrogen exchange coupled mass spectrometry. These results correlate with the B factors of available structures and the thermodynamic parameters associated with substrate binding, and suggest a higher level of conformational flexibility in the active site of EcMTAN.

The orderly degradation of PBS was observed under starvation conditions. A 14 kDa truncated fragment of alpha-subunit of PE (F-alphaPE) was identified from the degraded product. F-alphaPE was purified to homogeneity, sequenced and crystallized. The merohedrally twinned crystals with a twinning factor of approximately 0.5 were obtained. The crystal structure of F-alphaPE was determined with molecular replacement method using detwinned data and refined to an R(cryst) factor of 23.2% (R(free)=27.6%). The structure consisted of two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two molecules were designated as molecules A and B with a buried area of 200 A(2) at the interface. The structure of F-alphaPE consists of seven alpha-helices A, B, E, F, F', G and H.

Both molecules, A and B contain two chromophore ligands, PEB1 and PEB2 in each. These are covalently linked to the polypeptide chain through Cys82 and Cys139, respectively. The superimposition of C(alpha) tracings of molecules A and B shows an r.m.s. shift of 1.0 A indicating that the structures of two independent molecules are very similar.

Crystal structures of ligand-free PCL and its complexes with monomannoside and alpha1-3 dimannoside have been determined. The ligand-free PCL is dimeric, with both subunits adopt the beta-prism II fold. PCL subunit binds mannose using a potential bivalent mode instead of the usual trivalent mode, in which carbohydrate-binding site (CBS) I and CBS III adopt the conserved mannose-binding motif of QXDXNXVXY (X is one of any amino acid residues) as observed in other structurally characterized GNA-related lectins, while CBS II adopts a modified motif with residues Gln58 and Asp60, which are critical for mannose-binding, substituted by His58 and Asn60, respectively. As a result, CBS II is unfit for mannose-binding. In the mannoside complexes, ligand-bindings only occur at CBS I which provides the specificity for alpha1-3 dimannoside. CBS II and CBS III are cooperatively occupied by a well-ordered sulfate ion, through which the individual dimers are cross-linked to form a unique super-structure of 3(2) helical lattice. Surveying the sequences of GNA-related lectins revealed that the modified binding motif of CBS II is widely distributed in the Liliaceae family as an intrinsic structural element. There is evidence that other GNA-related lectins will also adopt the similar super-structure as PCL. Thus PCL structure, unique in ligand-binding mode, may represent a novel type of structure of GNA-related lectins.

Using a GE Medical MS8X-130 X-ray microCT scanner, optimal imaging parameters included scanning isolated corms at 80 k Vp and 100 microA with a 3500 ms exposure time and an isotropic voxel size of 10 microm.

The 3D structure of sclereid clusters was determined whereby the perimeter of their lance shape is greatly reinforced by sclereids with thicker secondary cell walls as compared to those of the interior of the cluster. The structure of sclereid clusters and their association with leaf traces suggests they may be stabilizing the corm-leaf connection to protect vascular tissues from physical damage.

In Salmonella, the small basic protein PmrD is found to protect phospho-PmrA and prolong the expression of PmrA-activated genes. In contrast, Escherichia coli PmrD fails to protect phospho-PmrA. Here, we show that Klebsiella pneumoniae PmrD (KP-PmrD) can inhibit the dephosphrylation of phospho-PmrA, and the interaction between KP-PmrD and the N-terminal receiver domain of PmrA (PmrA(N)) is much stronger in the presence than in the absence of the phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride (BeF(3)(-)) (K(D)=1.74 ± 0.81 μM vs. K(D)=236 ± 48 μM). To better understand the molecular interactions involved, the solution structure of KP-PmrD was found to comprise six β-strands and a flexible C-terminal α-helix. Amide chemical shift perturbations of KP-PmrD in complex with BeF(3)(-)-activated PmrA(N) suggested that KP-PmrD may undergo a certain conformational rearrangement on binding to activated PmrA(N). Saturation transfer experiments revealed the binding surface to be located on one face of the β-barrel. This finding was further verified by in vivo polymyxin B susceptibility assay of the mutants of KP-PmrD.

The hexameric packaging NTPase (P4) overlies these vertices, and the monomeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, P2) binds at sites inside the shell. P2 and P4 are present in substoichiometric amounts, raising the questions of whether they are recruited to the nascent procapsid in defined amounts and at specific locations, and whether they may co-localize to form RNA-processing assembly lines at one or more ""special"" vertices. We have used cryo-electron tomography to map both molecules on individual procapsids. The results show variable complements that accord with binomial distributions with means of 8 (P2) and 5 (P4), suggesting that they are randomly incorporated in copy numbers that simply reflect availability, i.e. their rates of synthesis. Analysis of the occupancy of potential binding sites (20 for P2; 12 for P4) shows no tendency to cluster nor for P2 and P4 to co-localize, suggesting that the binding sites for both proteins are occupied in random fashion.

In contrast, highly stable proteins such as GST and holoflavodoxin are not degraded at all. Attempts to identify sequence tags signaling for degradation in apoflavodoxin fragments have been unsuccessful. Apoflavodoxin adopts three conformations: native, partly unfolded and fully unfolded. It is revealing that degradation of the 31 variants is proportional to the molar fraction of fully unfolded molecules and inversely proportional to the fraction of stable apoflavodoxin molecules.

To obtain an exhaustive view of these distortions, we data mined a non-redundant subset of the Protein Data Bank in search of proline residues included either within contiguous helices or within structural motifs in which two helices are joined by a few linker residues with backbone dihedral angles in the generous alpha region. The distortions correspond to ""typical"" and ""non-typical"" proline distortions, with relative ratio of 0.65 and 0.35, respectively. Analysis of ""non-typical"" proline distortions indicates that most linkers have one (75%) or two residues (20%) and that proline is preferentially located at the second or third position of the second helix (95%). The dihedral angles of the linker residues are located in two areas of the generous alpha region. Structures with linker(s) in the alpha1 area, which is characterized by very negative phi values, possess i to i-5 H-bonds and correspond to pi bulges. Structures with linker(s) in the alpha2 area, which links the alpha and beta regions, possess i to i-3 H-bonds and correspond to tight turns. Further classification of bulges and turns as a function of the linker length and proline position yields five canonical structures, representing 85% of ""non-typical"" proline distortions.

Non-linear lens distortions induced by the electromagnetic lenses of the microscope render a seamless stitching with linear transformations impossible. This problem is aggravated by large CCD cameras, as they are commonly in use nowadays. We propose a new calibration method based on ridge regression that compensates non-linear lens distortions, while ensuring that the geometry of the image is preserved. Our method estimates the distortion correction from overlapping image areas using automatically extracted correspondence points. Therefore, the estimation of the correction transform does not require any special calibration samples. We evaluate our method on simulated ground truth data as well as on real electron microscopy data. Our experiments demonstrate that the lens calibration robustly corrects large distortions with an average stitching error exceeding 10 pixels to sub-pixel accuracy within two iteration steps.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Contact with the acidic reaction solution initiated the emergence and growth of dissolution pits in both the native and the fluoride-treated enamel. In native enamel, pits are first observed after 90 min exposure to the reaction solution, compared to 250 min in the case of the fluoride-treated enamel. These findings indicate that, within the constraints of this study, a single application of fluoride solution (1000 mg/L, 2 min) confers protection to the enamel surface against acid-mediated erosion. This paper also highlights the potential role intrinsic defects may have on the susceptibility of enamel to erosion and, in part, may explain why some people are more susceptible to acid erosion.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Pub1 has been implicated as a regulator of cellular mRNA decay. Nearly 10% of all yeast mRNA decay occurs in a Pub1-dependent manner. Pub1 binds to and stabilizes AU-rich element (ARE) and ARE-like sequence-containing transcripts by protecting them from degradation through the deadenylation-dependent pathway, and also binds to and stabilizes stabilizer element (STE)-containing transcripts by preventing their degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. RNA-binding analyses showed that Pub1 binds to poly(U) in vitro. Here we show the crystal structures of Pub1RRM2 and the first two tandem RRM domains (Pub1RRM12). Crystallography showed that the structure of Pub1RRM12 is a domain-swapped dimer. Size exclusion chromatography assay and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) showed that Pub1RRM12 is a monomer in solution. Kinetic analysis showed that all three individual RRM domains can bind to poly(U) with similar affinities and Pub1RRM12 binds to a long poly(U) segment with higher affinity.

This helix replaces a beta-hairpin that is required by human TrpRS for normal activity and has been inferred to play a similar role in all eukaryotic TrpRS. The primary sequences of TrpRS homologs from several basal eukaryotes including Giardia lack a set of three residues observed to stabilize interactions with this beta-hairpin in the human TrpRS. Thus the present structure suggests that the activation reaction mechanism of TrpRS from the basal eukaryote G. lamblia differs from that of higher eukaryotes. Furthermore, the protein as observed in the crystal forms an (alpha(2))(2) homotetramer. The canonical dimer interface observed in all previous structures of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases is maintained, but in addition each N-terminal alpha-helix reciprocally interlocks with the equivalent helix from a second dimer to form a dimer of dimers. Although we have no evidence for tetramer formation in vivo, modeling indicates that the crystallographically observed tetrameric structure would be compatible with the tRNA binding mode used by dimeric TrpRS and TyrRS.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Micro-computed tomography (microCT) was employed to create full three-dimensional images of the dorsal spines and basal plate, lateral plates, pelvic girdle and spines and to assess structural and compositional properties such as the spatial distribution of thickness (approximately 100-300 microm), the heterogeneous cross-sectional geometry (centrally thickened), plate-to-plate juncture and overlap (approximately 50% of the plate width), and bone mineral density (634-748 HA/cm(3)). The convolution of plate geometry in conjunction with plate-to-plate overlap allows a relatively constant armor thickness to be maintained throughout the assembly, promoting spatially homogeneous protection and thereby avoiding weakness at the armor unit interconnections. Plate-to-plate junctures act to register and join the plates while permitting compliance in sliding and rotation in selected directions. Mercury porosimetry was used to determine the pore size distribution and volume percent porosity of the lateral plates (20-35 vol.%) and spines (10-15 vol.%). SEM and microCT revealed a porous, sandwich-like cross-section beneficial for bending stiffness and strength at minimum weight. Back-scattered electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were utilized to quantify the weight percent mineral content (58-68%).

It was demonstrated that proteins extracted from biogenic stable ACC induce and stabilize synthetic ACC in vitro. Polyphosphate molecules were similarly shown to induce amorphous calcium carbonate formation in vitro. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that biogenic ACC induction and stabilization is mediated by the phosphorylated residues of phosphoproteins. We show that extracellular organic matrix extracted from gastroliths of the red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus induce stable ACC formation in vitro. The proteinaceous fraction of this organic matrix is highly phosphorylated and is incorporated into the ACC mineral phase during precipitation. We have identified the major phosphoproteins of the organic matrix and showed that they have high calcium binding capacity. Based on the above, in vitro precipitation experiments with single phosphoamino acids were performed, indicating that phosphoserine or phosphothreonine alone can induce the formation of highly stable ACC.

Ordered ECM macromolecules such as the fibril-forming collagens produce second harmonic generation (SHG) signal without the need for any exogenous label, while ECM macromolecules such as the elastin fibers generate MPEF signal due to their endogenous fluorescence characteristics. Both these signals can be captured simultaneously to provide spatially resolved 3D structural reorganization of ECM matrix. In this study, SHG and MPEF microscopy methods were used to examine structural remodeling of the ECM matrix in human lung alveolar walls undergoing severe emphysematous destruction. Flash frozen lung samples removed from two patients undergoing lung transplantation for severe COPD (n=4) were compared to similar samples from an unused donor lung (n=2) that served as a control. The imaging operations were performed directly on these tissue sections at least three different areas. The generated spatially resolved 3D images showed the distribution of collagen and elastin in the alveolar walls. In the case of the control, we found well ordered alveolar walls with a composite type structure made up of collagen bands and relatively fine elastic fibers. In contrast, lung tissues undergoing emphysematous destruction were highly disorganized with significantly increased alveolar wall thickness compared to the control.

Previous transmission electron microscope studies of thin sections from normal (Mut(+/+)) and diseased (Mut(-/-)) tissue found that the mitochondria appear to occupy a progressively larger volume of mutant cells with age, becoming megamitochondria. To assess changes in shape and volume of mitochondria resulting from the mutation, we carried out ion-abrasion scanning electron microscopy (IA-SEM), a method for 3D imaging that involves the iterative use of a focused gallium ion beam to abrade the surface of the specimen, and a scanning electron beam to image the newly exposed surface. Using IA-SEM, we show that mitochondria are more convoluted and have a broader distribution of sizes in the mutant tissue. Compared to normal cells, mitochondria from mutant cells have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio, which can be attributed to their convoluted shape and not to their elongation or reduced volume. The 3D imaging approach and image analysis described here could therefore be useful as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of disease progression in aberrant cells at resolutions higher than that currently achieved using confocal light microscopy.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

When water is evaporating, bdelloids contract into ""tuns"", silence metabolism and lose water from the body, a condition known as anhydrobiosis. Under controlled conditions, a bdelloid species (Macrotrachela quadricornifera) was made anhydrobiotic, and its morphology was studied by light, confocal and electron microscopy. A compact anatomy characterizes the anhydrobiotic rotifer, resulting in a considerable reduction of its body volume: the internal organs, precisely packed together, occupy the body cavity almost completely and the lumen of hollow organs disappears. Remarkable ultrastructural changes characterize the anhydrobiotic condition. The mitochondria are wholly surrounded by a ring of electron-dense particles, and the epidermal pores, open in the hydrated specimens, become gradually closed by structures similar to epithelial junctions. The cilia are densely packed: microtubules are still identifiable, but the axonemal organization appears disrupted. This is the first extensive comparative study on the morphological changes associated with the anhydrobiosis process in a rotifer, providing the basis for an improved understanding of the processes involved in this extreme adaptation.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A class of these proteins (Lys49-PLA(2)s) does not show catalytic activity but can exert a pronounced local myotoxic effect that is not neutralized by serum therapy. In this work, we present five structures of Lys49-PLA(2)s from snakes of the Bothrops genus in apo form, complexed with PEG molecules and chemically modified by p-bromofenacil bromide (BPB), a classic inhibitor of PLA(2). We present herein an extensive structural analysis including: (i) the function of hydrophobic long-chain molecules as Lys49-PLA(2)s inhibitors, (ii) the role of Lys122, previously indicated as being responsible for Lys49-PLA(2)s catalytic inactivity and, (iii) a structural comparison of the Ca(2+)-binding loop region between Lys49 and Asp49-PLA(2)s. The Lys122 analysis of 30 different monomers for apo and complexed Lys49-PLA(2)s structures shows that this residue is very flexible and may bind to different carboxyl groups giving stability to the crystal structures. The structural comparisons of the Ca(2+)-binding loop region between Lys49 and Asp49-PLA(2)s reveal the importance of the Tyr28 residue conservation in Asp49-PLA(2)s to the integrity of this loop.

Our method produces speedups of about an order of magnitude over a previously proposed GPU-based ET implementation, on similar hardware, and completes an iterative 3D reconstruction of practical problem size within minutes. We also describe a novel GPU-amenable approach that effectively compensates for reconstruction errors resulting from the TEM data acquisition on (long) samples which extend the width of the parallel TEM beam.

The average size of the microfibril was 17.1±1.8 μm in length and 39.8±8.8 nm in width. The FT-IR spectrum shows typical α-chitin pattern, and each band was sharper than crustacean chitin's, indicating higher crystallinity of the Phaeocystis chitin. The X-ray diffraction gave crystallite size more than twice of crustacean tendon's. The fiber diffraction pattern is consistent with previous studies with two-chains orthorhombic unit cell (Minke and Blackwell, 1978; Sikorski et al., 2009), and refined unit cell dimensions are a=4.742 Å, b=18.871 Å, c=10.338Å. High-resolution electron microscopy of ultrathin sections gave the cross-sectional shape of microfibril as hexagon. The lattice images of (020) plane (d=0.94 nm) were frequently observed extending the entire cross-section of microfibril, indicating its single crystalline nature.

However, the phase-contrast imaging method used in conventional cryo-electron tomography fails to faithfully represent the full range of structural features in such specimens. Only certain features are recorded with adequate contrast, and overall contrast is low. The recently developed Zernike phase contrast method has the potential to solve this problem, and here we apply it for the first time to cryo-electron tomography.

Several RGS proteins have been found to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. The 14-3-3 protein binding inhibits the GAP function of RGS proteins presumably by blocking their interaction with G(alpha) subunit. Since RGS proteins interact with G(alpha) subunits through their RGS domains, it is reasonable to assume that the 14-3-3 protein can either sterically occlude the G(alpha) interaction surface of RGS domain and/or change its structure. In this work, we investigated whether the 14-3-3 protein binding affects the structure of RGS3 using the time-resolved tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Two single-tryptophan mutants of RGS3 were used to study conformational changes of RGS3 molecule. Our measurements revealed that the 14-3-3 protein binding induces structural changes in both the N-terminal part and the C-terminal RGS domain of phosphorylated RGS3 molecule. Experiments with the isolated RGS domain of RGS3 suggest that this domain alone can, to some extent, interact with the 14-3-3 protein in a phosphorylation-independent manner. In addition, a crystal structure of the RGS domain of RGS3 was solved at 2.3A resolution. The data obtained from the resolution of the structure of the RGS domain suggest that the 14-3-3 protein-induced conformational change affects the region within the G(alpha)-interacting portion of the RGS domain. This can explain the inhibitory effect of the 14-3-3 protein on GAP activity of RGS3.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Some insects encounter wetting by rain, through contact with water collected on foliage, or in ponds, rivers or streams. There is an evolutionary pay-off for such insects to adopt hydrophobic structuring especially on regions that contact water, such as legs or large surface areas such as wings. Here we investigate lacewings which are good candidates for getting trapped to water because of a large wing surface area-to-body mass ratio. The lacewing utilises a variety of structures/mechanisms to contend with water contact. The first level involves small hairs (macrotrichia) that project from veins on the wings and collectively hold up droplets of water above the wing surface. This defence against wetting is aided by longitudinal ridges and troughs along the hair shaft. We show, by coating single hairs with a hydrophobic polymer (similar in hydrophobicity to insect cuticle), that the channels significantly contribute to repel water droplets. Beneath the array of hairs lies a dense netting on the cuticle wing surface which reduces contact with smaller droplets. The study has implications for both insect biology and biomimetic surfaces such as light weight superhydrophobic materials.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We here report on the 3.3A resolution crystal structure of HSA complexed with the cationic, and widely used, anesthetic lidocaine. We find that lidocaine and HSA co-crystallise as a dimer in the unusual space group I4(1). The dimer consists of one HSA molecule without ligand and one HSA molecule with a single, bound lidocaine. HSA is a heart-shaped protein composed of three homologous helical domains (I-III), which can be subdivided into two subdomains (A and B), and lidocaine binds to a unique site formed by residues from subdomain IB facing the central, interdomain crevice. In the crystal, binding seems to introduce only local conformational changes in the protein. According to intrinsic fluorescence experiments with aqueous HSA binding results in widespread conformational changes involving Trp214 in subdomain IIA. Results obtained with equilibrium dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry show that lidocaine binding is of a low affinity and occurs at one discrete binding site in accordance with the X-ray data. Another crystal form of ligand-free HSA obtained in the presence of ammonium sulphate was determined at 2.3A resolution revealing a sulphate ion accepting cavity at the surface of subdomain IIIA.

The method requires only three parameters: the segmentation threshold, a smoothing step size, and the number of smoothing steps. We first apply the method to maps generated from molecular structures and use a quantitative metric to measure the segmentation accuracy. The method does not attain perfect accuracy, however it produces single or small groups of regions that roughly match individual proteins or subunits. We also present two methods for fitting of structures into density maps, based on aligning the structures with single regions or small groups of regions. The first method aligns centers and principal axes, whereas the second aligns centers and then rotates the structure to find the best fit. We describe both interactive and automated ways of using these two methods.

The new PDZ structures are identical between the two crystal forms and among the four chains of the P1 crystal form. When we compare the new structures with the previous ones, some important conformational differences in the C-terminal alpha-helix and in the loop connecting beta2 and beta3 strands have been found. Additionally, the high resolution of the new structures has allowed us to indentify a succinimide residue at the position corresponding to Asp332 in the beta2-beta3 loop, which may contribute to the alternate conformation of this loop, and at the same time, to the interaction between residues from this loop and the C-terminal alpha-helix.

It was recently found that the isoflavone genistein (GEN) potently inhibits TTR amyloid fibril formation (Green et al., 2005) and is therefore a promising candidate for TTR amyloidosis treatment. Here we used structural and biophysical approaches to characterize genistein binding to the wild type (TTRwt) and to its most frequent amyloidogenic variant, the V30M mutant. In a dose-dependent manner, genistein elicited considerable increases in both mutant and TTRwt stability as demonstrated by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and acid-mediated dissociation/denaturation assays. TTR:GEN crystal complexes and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments showed that the binding mechanisms of genistein to the TTRwt and to V30M are different and are dependent on apoTTR structure conformations. Furthermore, we could also identify potential allosteric movements caused by genistein binding to the wild type TTR that explains, at least in part, the frequently observed negatively cooperative process between the two sites of TTRwt when binding ligands.

Here, we performed constraint biased Molecular Dynamics simulations along the reaction coordinate reaching from the diffusion regime to the bound complex.

Electrostatics and/or mutations influence the relative population of these patterns. Further, we computed the energy landscape of association as PMF (Potential of Mean Force) profiles within a reasonable agreement to experiment.

SHG imaging can provide the structural organization and molecular orientation information of bio-tissues without centrosymmetry. In recent years, SHG has proven its capability in the study of crystallized bio-molecules such as collagen and myosin. Starch, the most important food source and a promising future energy candidate, has, for a decade, been shown to exhibit strong SHG response. By comparing SHG intensity from different starch species, we first identified that the SHG-active molecule is amylopectin, which accounts for the crystallinity in starch granules. With the aid of SHG polarization anisotropy, we extracted the complete χ((2)) tensor of amylopectin, which reflects the underlying molecular details. Through χ((2)) tensor analysis, three-dimensional orientation and packing symmetry of amylopectin are determined. The helical angle of the double-helix in amylopectin is also deduced from the tensor, and the value corresponds well to previous X-ray studies, further verifying amylopectin as SHG source. It is noteworthy that the nm-sized structure of amylopectin inside a starch granule can be determined by this far-field optical method with 1-μm excitation wavelength.

It is believed that alteration of the flexibility is instrumental to the assembly of tau protein into paired helical filaments (PHF) in tauopathies. Tau flexibility represents the main obstacle for structure determination of its conformation in physiology and/or pathology.

Obtained results show that MN423 functions as a molecular mold for the PHF core segment, and opens the way for structure determination of other PHF core segments providing that other conformation-specific antibodies are available. Data from in silico docking of tau peptide into antibody mold, obtained in this study, show that biochemical data and computational approaches provide results comparable to X-ray crystallography.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We also demonstrate that traditional sequence similarity searching is insufficient to identify all but the close orthologues of such repeat-dominated proteins, but that by an analysis of repeat periodicity and composition, remote homologues can be found. One clear candidate, despite a great size discrepancy and unremarkable sequence identity, is the known filament-former FilP in the same species. Both proteins appear distinct from the archetypal bacterial IF-like protein; they therefore may constitute a new class of bacterial filamentous protein. The similar sequence characteristics of both suggest their likely oligomer state and a possible mechanism for higher-order assembly into filaments.

In many TAAs this coiled coil is extended by a segment of varying length, which has pentadecad (15/4) periodicity. We used X-ray crystallography and biochemical methods to analyze the transition between these two periodicities in the coiled-coil stalk of the Yersinia adhesin YadA. Our results show how the strong right-handed supercoil of the 15/4-periodic part locally undergoes further over-winding to 19/5, before switching at a fairly constant rate over 14 residues to the canonical left-handed supercoil of the 7/2-periodic part. The transition region contains two YxD motifs, which are characteristic for right-handed coiled-coil segments of TAAs. This novel coiled-coil motif forms a defined network of inter- and intrahelical hydrogen bonds, thus serving as a structural determinant. Supercoil fluctuations have hitherto been described in coiled coils whose main sequence periodicity is disrupted locally by discontinuities. Here we present the first detailed analysis of two fundamentally different coiled-coil periodicities being accommodated in the same structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The Workshop this time was generously sponsored by Elsevier and by the M.E. Mueller Foundation/M.E. Mueller Institute for Structural Biology. The format, as usual, was to invite Chairs and a few keynote contributors for each session, but then at the Workshop itself to allow the Chairs to invite delegates to present something of their latest work. The Chairs arranged the programme accordingly and allotted time to each depending on the numbers involved. Of course particular sessions can (and did) prove especially popular and a degree of flexibility in extending some sessions and shortening others was necessary. This format, whilst a challenge on occasions to the Chairs and the Organisers, has proved remarkably successful over the years. Significant benefits of the Workshops include both the opportunity of meeting in an informal environment with colleagues in related fields with whom they would not normally collaborate, and also the chance to learn of new developments in techniques and software (for example) that are relevant across many facets of the field of fibrous proteins. Developments in structure and function in one protein system can often foster ideas and approaches in others. Considerable cross-fertilisation has occurred in past Workshops, with perhaps even more taking place in this latest one. The Guest of Honour was Professor Kenneth Holmes FRS, an eminent scientist who has made major contributions in the structural biology field, particularly on tobacco mosaic virus and on muscle and, in the latter case, more specifically, on thin filament structure and function. At Alpbach, Ken Holmes presented a fascinating and beautifully illustrated lecture on the research that he has undertaken over a span of more than 50 years. He mentioned in context the remarkable galaxy of other eminent scientists, a Who’s Who of 20th century structural biologists, with whom he has collaborated over the years. The first paper in this Special Issue is by Ken Holmes and in it he provides a delightful personal account of his life with fibres. Learning a little of the history of world class scientists such as Ken, their successes and their (rare) failures, provides an insight into the individuals concerned, and is something that we hear about all too infrequently.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Nebulin spans the thin filament length, its C-terminus is anchored in the Z-disc, and its N-terminal region is located toward the thin filament pointed end. Various lines of evidence indicate that nebulin plays important roles in thin filament and Z-disc structure in skeletal muscle. In the present work we studied nebulin in a range of muscle types during postnatal development and performed transcript studies with a mouse nebulin exon microarray, developed by us, whose results were confirmed by RT-PCR. We also performed protein studies with high-resolution SDS-agarose gels and Western blots, and structural studies with electron microscopy. We found during postnatal development of the soleus muscle major changes in splicing in both the super-repeat region and the Z-disc region of nebulin; interestingly, these changes were absent in other muscle types. Three novel Z-disc exons, previously described in the mouse gene, were upregulated during postnatal development of soleus muscle and this was correlated with a significant increase in Z-disc width. These findings support the view that nebulin plays an important role in Z-disc width regulation. In summary, we discovered changes in both the super-repeat region and the Z-disc region of nebulin, that these changes are muscle-type specific, and that they correlate with differences in sarcomere structure.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

They assemble from elementary dimers that are built around the central alpha-helical coiled-coil rod domain representing the IF 'signature'. The rod consists of two similarly-sized parts, coil 1 and coil 2, connected by a non-alpha-helical linker L12. Coil 2 is absolutely conserved in length across all IF types and was initially predicted to consist of a short coiled-coil segment 2A based on a heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues, another linker L2 and a coiled-coil segment 2B. Here we present the crystal structure of human vimentin fragment including residues 261-335 i.e. approximately the first half of coil 2. The N-terminal part of this fragment reveals a parallel alpha-helical bundle characterized by 3.5 consecutive hendecad repeats. It is immediately followed by a regular left-handed coiled coil. The distinct non-helical linker L2 is therefore not observed. Together with the previously determined crystal structure of the major part of segment 2B (Strelkov et al., 2002), we can now build a complete atomic model of the 21nm long vimentin coil 2 dimer being a relatively rigid rod.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We now examine a panel of 14 additional arylstibonic acid derivatives of NSC13778 for their ability to inhibit the DNA binding of five B-ZIP dimers (c-Fos|JunD, VBP, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, and CREB). They show various specificities at inhibiting the DNA binding of five B-ZIP domains. NSC13746 inhibits the DNA binding of C/EBPbeta and CREB at 100nM and promiscuously inhibiting the DNA binding of all five proteins in the 1muM range. Dialysis experiments indicate that NSC 13746 binding to the B-ZIP domain is reversible. Thermal denaturation studies indicate that NSC13746 binds the B-ZIP domain. Some compounds specifically inhibit DNA binding, with VBP and c-Fos|JunD being most easily disrupted. These compounds inhibit, with similar specificities to the pure B-ZIP domains, the DNA binding of nuclear extract to the AP1 DNA sequence but no inhibition is observed to SP1 containing oligonucleotide. Transient transfection assays indicate that NSC13746 can inhibit the TPA induced activation of two B-ZIP dependent reporters. These experiments suggest that arylstibonic acids are promising leads for inhibiting the DNA binding of a group of B-ZIP proteins in cells.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Despite a total of 45 potential heterotrimeric chain combinations formed through the coiled-coil domain of the 11 identified laminin chains (α1–5, β1–3, γ1–3), to date only 15 different laminin isoforms have been reported. This observation raises the question whether laminin assembly is regulated by differential gene expression or specific chain recognition. To address this issue, we here perform a complete analysis of laminin chain assembly and specificity. Using biochemical and biophysical techniques, all possible heterotrimeric combinations from recombinant C-terminal coiled-coil fragments of all chains were analysed. Apart from laminin 323 (α3, β2, γ3), for which no biochemical evidence of its existence in vivo is available, these experiments confirmed all other known laminin isoforms and identified two novel potential chain combinations, laminins 312 (α3, β1, γ2) and 422 (α4, β2, γ4).

Escherichia coli remains the dominant expression system in structural biology with nearly 90% of the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) derived from proteins produced in this bacterial host. However, many mammalian and eukaryotic viral proteins require post-translation modification for proper folding and/or are part of large multimeric complexes. Therefore expression in higher eukaryotic cell lines from both invertebrate and vertebrate is required to produce these proteins. Although these systems are generally more time-consuming and expensive to use than bacteria, there have been improvements in technology that have streamlined the processes involved. For example, the use of multi-host vectors, i.e., containing promoters for not only E. coli but also mammalian and baculovirus expression in insect cells, enables target genes to be evaluated in both bacterial and higher eukaryotic hosts from a single vector. Culturing cells in micro-plate format allows screening of large numbers of vectors in parallel and is amenable to automation. The development of large-scale transient expression in mammalian cells offers a way of rapidly producing proteins with relatively high throughput. Strategies for selenomethionine-labelling (important for obtaining phase information in crystallography) and controlling glycosylation (important for reducing the chemical heterogeneity of glycoproteins) have also been reported for higher eukaryotic cell expression systems.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Thus, a majority of time, effort and resources are invested preparing potential derivatized crystals for synchrotron data collection and analysis without knowledge of heavy atom labeling. To remove this uncertainty, we introduce Fluorescence Detection of Heavy Atom Labeling (FD-HAL) using tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (a fluorescent maleimide compound) to monitor in-gel cysteine residue accessibility and ascertain covalent modification by mercury, platinum and gold compounds. We have tested this technique on three integral membrane proteins (LacY, vSGLT and mVDAC1) and can quickly assess the optimal concentrations, time and heavy atom compound to derivatize free cysteine residues in order to facilitate crystal phasing. This, in conjunction with cysteine scanning for incorporating heavy atoms at strategic positions, is a useful tool that will considerably assist in phasing membrane protein structures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here, we show that MuRF1 is preferentially induced in type-II muscle fibers after denervation. Fourteen days after denervation, MuRF1 protein was further elevated but remained preferentially expressed in type-II muscle fibers. Consistent with a fiber-type dependent function of MuRF1, the tibialis anterior muscle (rich in type-II muscle fibers) was considerably more protected in MuRF1-KO mice from muscle wasting when compared to soleus muscle with mixed fiber-types. We also determined fiber-type distributions in MuRF1/MuRF2 double-deficient KO (dKO) mice, because MuRF2 is a close homolog of MuRF1. MuRF1/MuRF2 dKO mice showed a profound loss of type-II fibers in soleus muscle. As a potential mechanism we identified the interaction of MuRF1/MuRF2 with myozenin-1, a calcineurin/NFAT regulator and a factor required for maintenance of type-II muscle fibers. MuRF1/MuRF2 dKO mice had lost myozenin-1 expression in tibialis anterior muscle, implicating MuRF1/MuRF2 as regulators of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. In summary, our data suggest that expression of MuRF1 is required for remodeling of type-II fibers under pathophysiological stress states, whereas MuRF1 and MuRF2 together are required for maintenance of type-II fibers, possibly via the regulation of myozenin-1.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Two different helical symmetries have been proposed: seven residues in two turns versus 10 residues in three turns. Collagen model peptides show predominantly the 7-fold symmetry but provide evidence for local changes in the helical twist, which are related to some extent to the local sequence of the peptides but also to the lattice interactions in the crystal. Thus, it is difficult to determine precisely to what degree the amino acid sequence dictates the fine details of collagen conformation. A new method is presented here in which an internal triple helical twist is defined. This method takes into consideration all three chains simultaneously, and facilitates investigating the sequence dependence of helical twist variation, the conformational consequences of collagen interruptions, and the effects on collagen conformation introduced upon receptor or ligand-binding. Analysis of the crystal structures of model peptides suggests that collagen varies gradually and continuously its helical twist according to the local distribution of imino acid residues, with the 7-fold and 10-fold symmetries representing the limits of this variation for the cases of imino acid saturation or absence, respectively.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It was recently shown that PKCalpha phosphorylates two highly-conserved residues (S26 and S170) of the PEVK region in cardiac titin, resulting in passive tension increase. To determine how each phosphorylated residue affects myocardial stiffness, we generated three recombinant mutant PEVK fragments (S26A, S170A and S170A/S26A), each flanked by Ig domains. Single-molecule force spectroscopy shows that PKCalpha decreases the PEVK persistence length (from 0.99 to 0.68 nm); the majority of this decrease is attributable to phosphorylation of S26. Before PKCalpha, all three mutant PEVK fragments showed at least 40% decrease in persistence length compared to wildtype. Furthermore, Ig domain unfolding force measurements indicate that PEVK's flanking Ig domains are relatively unstable compared to other titin Ig domains. We conclude that phosphorylation of S26 is the primary mechanism through which PKCalpha modulates cardiac stiffness.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We have used a synthetic peptide approach to investigate three stability control sites within the stability control region (residues 97-118). Two of the sites, electrostatic cluster 1 (97-104, EELDRAQE) and electrostatic cluster 2 (112-118, KLEEAEK), feature sequences with unusually high charge density and the potential to form multiple intrachain and interchain salt bridges (ionic attractions). A third site (105-111, RLATALQ) features an e position Leu residue, an arrangement known previously to enhance coiled-coil stability modestly. A native peptide and seven peptide analogs of the tropomyosin sequence 85-119 were prepared by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. Thermal stability measurements by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed the following T(m) values for the native peptide and three key analogs: 52.9 degrees C (Native), 46.0 degrees C (R101A), 45.3 degrees C (K112A/K118A), and 27.9 degrees C (L110A). The corresponding DeltaT(m) values for the analogs, relative to the native peptide, are -6.9 degrees C, -7.6 degrees C, and -25.0 degrees C, respectively. The dramatic contribution to stability made by L110e is three times greater than the contribution of either electrostatic cluster 1 or 2, likely resulting from a novel hydrophobic interaction not previously observed. These thermal stability results were corroborated by temperature profiling analyses using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). We believe that the combined contributions of the interactions within the three stability control sites are responsible for the effect of the stability control region in tropomyosin, with the Leu110e contribution being most critical.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Structural studies of the SPB are limited by its low copy number in the cell, its large size and heterogeneous composition, and its association with the nuclear membrane. However, low-resolution or indirect structural information about the SPB may be deciphered through a variety of techniques. Interestingly, a large proportion of SPB proteins are predicted to contain one or more coiled coils, a common protein interaction motif. The high frequency of coiled coils suggests that this structure is important for establishing the overall architecture of the complex. Support for this hypothesis was reported previously for coiled coils from some SPB proteins. Here, we extend this approach of isolating and characterizing additional SPB coiled coils to improve our understanding of SPB structure and organization. Self-associating coiled coils from Bbp1, Mps2, and Nbp1 were observed to form stable parallel homodimers in solution. Coiled-coil peptides from Bbp1 and Mps2 were also observed to hetero-associate. Experimental coiled-coil interaction data from this work and previous studies, as well as predicted and experimental structures for other SPB protein fragments and domains, were integrated to generate a model of the SPB structure.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their constituent helices show crossing angles that mainly cluster around +20 degrees (aligned) or -50 degrees (orthogonal). Bundles with all helices aligned are called 'square' and comprise four-helical coiled coils as their structurally most regular form. Since coiled coils can be described fully by parametric equations, they can serve as a reference point for quantifying the conformational space of all square bundles. To this end we have developed a program, samCC, which measures the deviation of a given bundle from an idealized coiled coil and decomposes this into axial rotation and axial, radial, and angular shifts. We present examples of analyses performed with the program and focus in particular on the axial rotation states of helices in coiled coils, in order to gain further insight into a proposed mechanism for transmembrane signal transduction, which involves a 26 degrees axial rotation of helices between a canonical coiled coil and a variant called the Alacoil. We find that, unlike expected from the mechanistic model, coiled coils show a continuum of axial rotation states, suggesting that the Alacoil does not represent a single, defined state.

We show that in solution B. licheniformis AT forms stable trimers. In crystals, depending on pH, such trimers assemble into two different types of dodecameric particles, both having 23 point group symmetry. The dodecamer formed at pH 6.0 has the same conformation as previously observed for B. subtilis AT. This dodecamer contains a large internal chamber with the volume of ∼700 Å3, which is lined by the side chains of twelve valine residues. The presence of the hydrophobic chamber hints at the possibility that the dodecamer formation could be induced by binding of a ligand.

Proteoglycans, through their protein core and highly anionic glycosaminoglycan side chains, are thought to regulate the collagen organisation in the corneal stroma. To understand the inter-relationships between proteoglycans and collagen fibrils in the cornea, adult mouse corneas were treated with cuprolinic blue and three-dimensional reconstructions of the anterior, mid and posterior corneal stroma were obtained. The reconstructions show regular diameters of collagen fibrils throughout the cornea and uniform interfibrillar spacing within each region. Both longitudinal and transverse reconstructions were obtained to establish a clear picture of proteoglycan organisation, yet no distinct regular pattern or symmetry of proteoglycan orientation was observed. Large, electron-dense proteoglycans (possibly chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate proteoglycans) interconnecting two or often three adjacent collagen fibrils are seen, whilst another sub-population of smaller proteoglycans (of the keratan sulphate variety) interconnect only neighbouring fibrils.

Here, we report the crystal structures of the intracellular domain of FeoB (NFeoB) from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpNFeoB) and Pyrococcus furiosus (PfNFeoB) with and without bound ligands. In the structures, a canonical G-protein domain (G domain) is followed by a helical bundle domain (S-domain), which despite its lack of sequence similarity between species is structurally conserved. In the nucleotide-free state, the G-domain's two switch regions point away from the binding site. This gives rise to an open binding pocket whose shallowness is likely to be responsible for the low nucleotide-binding affinity. Nucleotide binding induced significant conformational changes in the G5 motif which in the case of GMPPNP binding was accompanied by destabilization of the switch I region. In addition to the structural data, we demonstrate that Fe(II)-induced foot printing cleaves the protein close to a putative Fe(II)-binding site at the tip of switch I, and we identify functionally important regions within the S-domain.

Flexibility of elongated straight molecules typically is assessed by persistence length, a measure of lengthwise thermal bending fluctuations. However, if a molecule's equilibrium conformation is curved, this formulation yields an ""apparent"" persistence length ( approximately 100nm for tropomyosin), measuring deviations from idealized straight conformations which then overestimate actual dynamic flexibility. To obtain the ""dynamic"" persistence length, a true measurement of flexural stiffness, the average curvature of the molecule must be taken into account. Different methods used in our studies for measuring the dynamic persistence length directly from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of tropomyosin are described here in detail. The dynamic persistence length found, 460+/-40nm, is approximately 12-times longer than tropomyosin and 5-times the apparent persistence length, showing that tropomyosin is considerably stiffer than previously thought. The longitudinal twisting behavior of tropomyosin during MD shows that the amplitude of end-to-end twisting fluctuation is approximately 30 degrees when tropomyosin adopts its near-average conformation.

The added value compared to previous approaches, is that the algorithm explores a huge number of random positions, which are tracked on several micrographs, while being able to identify trace failures, using a cross-validation procedure based on the 3D marker model of the tilt-series. Furthermore, this method allows the reliable identification of areas which behave as a rigid body during the tilt-series and hence addresses specific difficulties for the alignment of vitreous sections, by correcting practical caveats. The resulting alignments can attain sub-pixel precision at the local level and is able to yield a substantial number of usable tilt-series (around 60%). In principle, the algorithm has the potential to run in a fully automated fashion, and could be used to align any tilt-series directly from the microscope. Finally, we have significantly improved the user interface and implemented the source code on the graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the computations.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It also acts as a leukotriene C4 transporter, and hence has a role in adaptive immune response. Most C-class members have an additional NH(2)-terminal transmembrane domain versus other ATP-binding cassette transporters, but little is known about the structure and role of this domain. Using electron cryomicroscopy of 2D crystals, data at 1/6per A(-1) resolution was generated for the full-length ABCC1 protein in the absence of ATP. Analysis using homologous structures from bacteria and mammals allowed the core transmembrane domains to be localised in the map. These display an inward-facing conformation and there is a noteworthy separation of the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains. Examination of non-core features in the map suggests that the additional NH(2)-terminal domain has extensive contacts on one side of both core domains, and mirrors their inward-facing configuration in the absence of nucleotide.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

The proposed mechanism suggests that the proteins sequester phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PIP(2)) in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. We found that model anionic phospholipid membranes in the form of liposomes induce rapid oligomerization of GAP-43 and BASP1 proteins. Multiply charged phosphoinositides produced the most potent effect. Anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at submicellar concentration stimulated formation of similar oligomers in solution. BASP1, but not GAP-43, also formed oligomers at sufficiently high concentration in the absence of lipids and SDS. Electron microscopy study demonstrated that the oligomers have disk-shaped or annular structure of 10-30nm in diameter. BASP1 also formed higher aggregates of linear rod-like structure, with average length of about 100nm. In outward appearance, the oligomers and linear aggregates are reminiscent of oligomers and protofibrils of amyloid proteins. Both the synthetic N-terminal peptide GAP-43(1-40) and the brain-derived fragment GAP-43-3 preserved the ability to oligomerize under the action of acidic phospholipids and SDS. On the contrary, BASP1 fragment truncated by the short N-terminal myristoylated peptide was unable to form oligomers. GAP-43 and BASP1 oligomerization can be regulated by calmodulin, which disrupts the oligomers and displaces the proteins from the membrane. We suggest that in vivo, the role of membrane-bound GAP-43 and BASP1 oligomers consists in accumulation of PIP(2) in functional clusters, which become accessible for other PIP(2)-binding proteins after dissociation of the oligomers.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A hallmark of FN function is its characteristic assembly into filaments and fibers to form an insoluble matrix which functions as a scaffolding onto which cells attach, migrate, and deposit other matrix constituents. In this study, we have investigated the effects of differently charged and functionalized surfaces on FN conformations using atomic force microscopy. We demonstrate that a negatively charged polysulfonated surface promotes the formation of highly periodic, micrometer-long FN filaments having a ""bead-on-a-string"" structure with a bead periodicity of about 60 nm. Beaded filaments were observed when FN was adsorbed to polysulfonate surface in water; higher ionic strength allowed formation of filamentous structures but altered the regularity of the beads. FN did not form filaments when adsorbed onto the polysulfonate surface in the presence of soluble polysulfonates emphasizing the role of negatively charged, solid-phase elements on FN assembly. This charge-driven assembly likely derives from the negative surface promoting extension and opening of the protein, and we suggest a model where this assembly pattern is further stabilized by known self-assembly regions. Our results give insight into how FN fibrillogenesis might be promoted in vivo at cell surfaces by the negatively charged and sulfonated environment created by cell-surface, transmembrane proteoglycans.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Increased stability of this enzyme with regards to temperature and different solvent conditions are of great importance to the reliability and versatility of its applications. We here report the crystal structure of the cholesterol oxidase of Chromobacterium sp. DS-1 (CHOLOX). In contrast to other previously characterized cholesterol oxidases, this enzyme retains high activity in organic solvents and detergents at temperatures above 85 degrees C despite its mesophilic origin. With the availability of one other homologous oxidase of known three-dimensional structure, a detailed comparison of its sequence and structure was performed to elucidate the mechanisms of stabilization. In contrast to factors that typically contribute to the stability of thermophilic proteins, the structure of CHOLOX exhibits a larger overall cavity volume, less charged residues and less salt bridge interactions. Moreover, the vast majority of residue substitutions were found on or near the protein's solvent exposed surface.

This approach succeeds in producing full resolution tomograms with an important reduction in processing time, as evaluated with the most common reconstruction algorithms, namely WBP and SIRT. The main advantage stems from the fact that this approach is to be run on standard computers without the need of specialized hardware, which facilitates the development, use and management of programs.

This structural heterogeneity poses a major challenge in the study of macromolecular structure using single-particle electron microscopy. We propose a fully automated, unsupervised method for the three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple structural models from heterogeneous data. As a starting reference, our method employs an initial structure that does not account for any heterogeneity. Then, a multi-stage clustering is used to create multiple models representative of the heterogeneity within the sample. The multi-stage clustering combines an existing approach based on Multivariate Statistical Analysis to perform clustering within individual Euler angles, and a newly developed approach to sort out class averages from individual Euler angles into homogeneous groups. Structural models are computed from individual clusters. The whole data classification is further refined using an iterative multi-model projection-matching approach. We tested our method on one synthetic and three distinct experimental datasets. The tests include the cases where a macromolecular complex exhibits structural flexibility and cases where a molecule is found in ligand-bound and unbound states.

We have been developing methods for predicting the structures for GPCR ligand complexes, but validation has been hampered by a lack of experimental structures with which to compare our predictions. We report here the predicted structures of the human adenosine GPCR subtypes (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) and the binding sites for adenosine agonist and eight antagonists to this predicted structure, making no use of structural data, and compare with recent experimental crystal structure for ZM241385 bound human A(2A) receptor. The predicted structure correctly identifies 9 of the 12 crystal binding site residues. Moreover, the predicted binding energies of eight antagonists to the predicted structure of A(2A) correlate quite well with experiment. These excellent predictions resulted when we used Monte Carlo techniques to optimize the loop structures, particularly the cysteine linkages. Ignoring these linkages led to a much worse predicted binding site (identifying only 3 of the 12 important residues).

 Abstract
 
 In order to investigate the functional and structural properties of cationic α-helical peptides in two different membranes, we studied the 20-residue peptide maximin H6 in two membrane-mimetic systems by NMR spectroscopy using partially 15N-labeled peptide and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Maximin H6, which is found in skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family, attacks gram-negative bacteria and acts haemolytically. While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by 15N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the micelle and rotated by ∼70° around its helix axis in the negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might form the basis for peptide–peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively charged microbial cell walls.

This study represents the first extensive characterization of catechols adducts of 1,2-CTDs. The structural analyses reveal the diverse modes of binding to the active metal iron ion of the tested catechols thus allowing to identify the residues selectively involved in recognition of the diverse substrates by this class of enzymes. The comparison is further extended to the structural and functional characteristics of the other 1,2-CTDs isolated from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover the high structural homology of the present enzyme with the 3-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from the same bacterium are discussed in terms of their different substrate specificity. The catalytic rates for Rho 1,2-CTD conversion of the tested compounds are also compared with the calculated energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (E(HOMO)) of the substrates.

This indicates that for these substrates the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dependent on their nucleophilic reactivity. The discrepancies observed in the quantitative relationship for 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate are ascribed to the sterical hindrances leading to the distorted binding of such catechols observed in the corresponding structures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

A perspective.,"Tropomyosin is a two-chained alpha-helical coiled coil that binds along the length of the actin filament and regulates its function. The paper addresses the question of how a ""simple"" coiled-coil sequence encodes the information for binding and regulating the actin filament, its universal target. Determination of the tropomyosin sequence confirmed Crick's predicted heptapeptide repeat of hydrophobic interface residues and revealed additional features that have been shown to be important for its function: a 7-fold periodicity predicted to correspond to actin binding sites and interruptions of the canonical interface with destabilizing residues, such as Ala. Evidence from published work is summarized, leading to the proposal of a paradigm that binding of tropomyosin to the actin filament requires local instability as well as regions of flexibility. The flexibility derives from bends and local unfolding at regions with a destabilized coiled-coil interface, as well as from the dynamic end-to-end complex. The features are required for tropomyosin to assume the form of the helical actin filament, and to bind to actin monomers along its length. The requirement of instability/flexibility for binding may be generalized to the binding of other coiled coils to their targets.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We have shown that the N-terminal domain (1-171) is essential and sufficient for oligomerization and binding to DNA, while the C-terminal domain (172-252) does not bind DNA nor oligomerize. Modelisation of Sak N-terminal domain suggests that DNA may bind a positively charged crevice that runs external to the ring. Annealing and stimulation of RecA strand exchange indicate that only the N-terminal domain is capable of single-strand annealing and both domains do not stimulate the RecA strand exchange reaction.

However, due to dose restrictions and the inability to acquire high tilt angle images, the reconstructed volumes are noisy and have missing information. Thus, features are unreliable, and precision extraction of the cell boundary is difficult, manual and time intensive. This paper presents an efficient recursive algorithm called BLASTED (Boundary Localization using Adaptive Shape and Texture Discovery) to automatically extract the cell boundary using a conditional random field (CRF) framework in which boundary points and shape are jointly inferred. The algorithm learns the texture of the boundary region progressively, and uses a global shape model and shape-dependent features to propose candidate boundary points on a slice of the membrane. It then updates the shape of that slice by accepting the appropriate candidate points using local spatial clustering, the global shape model, and trained boosted texture classifiers. The BLASTED algorithm segmented the cell membrane over an average of 93% of the length of the cell in 19 difficult cryo-ET datasets.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a pyrimidine salvage pathway enzyme that recycles cytidine and 2'-deoxycytidine for uridine and 2'-deoxyuridine synthesis, respectively. A probable M. tuberculosis CDA-coding sequence (cdd, Rv3315c) was cloned, sequenced, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectrometry, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, gel filtration chromatography, and metal analysis of M. tuberculosis CDA (MtCDA) were carried out. These results and multiple sequence alignment demonstrate that MtCDA is a homotetrameric Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme. Steady-state kinetic measurements yielded the following parameters: K(m)=1004 microM and k(cat)=4.8s(-1) for cytidine, and K(m)=1059 microM and k(cat)=3.5s(-1) for 2'-deoxycytidine. The pH dependence of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) for cytidine indicate that protonation of a single ionizable group with apparent pK(a) value of 4.3 abolishes activity, and protonation of a group with pK(a) value of 4.7 reduces binding. MtCDA was crystallized and crystal diffracted at 2.0 A resolution. Analysis of the crystallographic structure indicated the presence of a Zn(2+) coordinated by three conserved cysteines and the structure exhibits the canonical cytidine deaminase fold.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

New methods are needed to probe the interactions of these proteins with calcium phosphate mineral and with each other. Here we follow calcium phosphate mineralization on protein fibers self-assembled in vitro from solutions of fibronectin, elastin and their mixture. We probe the surface morphology and mechanical properties of the protein fibers during the early stages. The development of mineral crystals on the protein matrices is also investigated. In physiological mineralization solution, the elastic modulus of the fibers in the fibronectin-elastin mixture increases to a greater extent than that of the fibers from either pure protein. In the presence of fibronectin, longer exposure in the mineral solution leads to the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate particles templated along the self-assembled fibers, while elastin fibers only collect calcium without any mineral observed during early stage. TEM images confirm that small needle-shape crystals are confined inside elastin fibers which suppress the release of mineral outside the fibers during late stage, while hydroxyapatite crystals form when fibronectin is present. These results demonstrate complementary actions of the two ECM proteins fibronectin and elastin to collect cations and template mineral, respectively.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Clusters of small alanine residues in place of canonical leucines along coiled-coil tropomyosin may be responsible for pre-shaping tropomyosin and promoting conformational complementarity to F-actin. A longitudinal displacement between the two chains of the tropomyosin coiled-coil induced by the alanine clusters could produce localized bending or limited flexibility along tropomyosin needed to shape tropomyosin (Brown and Cohen, 2005). To evaluate the influence of alanine clusters on tropomyosin curvature, we calculated the longitudinal displacement between amino acid residues on adjacent chains of the tropomyosin coiled-coil and related this ""Z-displacement"" to the position of the alanine clusters. Measurements were made on high-resolution crystal structures of tropomyosin fragments and on trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations of full-length alphaalpha-tropomyosin. We found no strict one-for-one spatial correlation between alanine cluster position and the Z-displacement. Neither did we find any direct correspondence between the clusters and the local curvature of tropomyosin. Rather than just causing specific local structural effects, the overall influence of alanine clusters is complex and delocalized, leading to a gradually changing bending pattern along the length of tropomyosin.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Here we present a procedure where even poorly segmented density can be used to determine the fold of the protein. The method is automated, fast, capable of searching for multiple copies of a protein fold, and accessible to densities encompassing more than a thousand residues. The automation is particularly powerful as it allows the procedure to take full advantage of the expanding repository in the Protein Data Bank. We have tested the method on nine segmented sub-nanometer image reconstruction electron densities. The method successfully identifies the correct fold for the six densities for which an atomic structure is known, identifies a fold that agrees with prior structural data, a fold that agrees with predictions from the Fold & Function Assignment server, and a fold that correlates with secondary structure prediction. The identified folds in the last three examples can be used as templates for comparative modeling of the bacteriophage P22 tail-machine (a 3MDa complex composed of 39 protein subunits).",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Multiple Tm isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of four genes, and individual isoforms show specific localisation patterns in many cell types, and can have differing effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Fluorescently-tagged Tm isoforms and mutants were expressed in C2C12 cells to investigate the mechanisms of alternative localisation of high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) Tms. Fluorescently-tagged Tm constructs show similar localisation to endogenous Tms as observed by antibodies, with the HMW Tm3 relatively diminished at the periphery of cells compared to LMW isoforms Tm5b or Tm5NM1. Tm3 and Tm5b only differ in their N-terminal exons, but these N-terminal exons do not independently direct localisation within the cell, as chimeric mutants Tm3-Tm5NM1 and Tm5b-Tm5NM1 show an increased peripheral localisation similar to Tm5NM1. The lower abundance of Tm3 at the periphery of the cell is not a result of different protein dynamics, as Tm3 and Tm5b show similar recovery after photobleaching. The relative exclusion of Tm3 from the periphery of cells does, however, require interaction with the actin filament, as mutants with truncations at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus are unable to localise to actin stress fibres, and are present in the most peripheral regions of the cell. We conclude that it is the entire Tm molecule which is the unit of sorting, and that the alternatively spliced N-terminal exons do not act as autonomous targeting signals.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Raman spectroscopy, in situ electric field dynamic oscillatory rheology and polarized optical microscopy indicated that silk fibroin electrogelation involved intermolecular self-assembly of silk molecules into amorphous, micron-scale, micellar structures and the formation of relatively long lifetime, intermicellar entanglement crosslinks. Overall, the electrogelation process did not require significant intramolecular beta-strand or intermolecular beta-sheet formation, unlike silk hydrogels. The kinetics of e-gel formation could be tuned by changing the field strength and assembly conditions, such as silk concentration and solution pH, while e-gel stiffness was partially reversible by removal of the applied field. Transient adhesion testing indicated that the adhesive characteristics of e-gels could at least partially be attributed to a local increase in proton concentration around the positive electrode due to the applied field and surface effects. A working model of electrogelation was described en route to understanding the origins of the adhesive characteristics.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Clinically isolated trimethoprim-resistant strains reveal a double mutation, H30N/F98Y, in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In order to develop novel and effective therapeutics against these resistant strains, we evaluated a series of propargyl-linked antifolate lead compounds for inhibition of the mutant enzyme. For the propargyl-linked antifolates, the F98Y mutation generates minimal (between 1.2- and 6-fold) losses of affinity and the H30N mutation generates greater losses (between 2.4- and 48-fold). Conversely, trimethoprim affinity is largely diminished by the F98Y mutation (36-fold) and is not affected by the H30N mutation. In order to elucidate a mechanism of resistance, we determined a crystal structure of a complex of this double mutant with a lead propargyl-linked antifolate. This structure suggests a resistance mechanism consistent both for the propargyl-linked class of antifolates and for trimethoprim that is based on the loss of a conserved water-mediated hydrogen bond.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Most of these studies that targeted complexes with intact microtubules have been carried out by helical 3-D reconstruction, while few were analyzed by single particle approaches or from 2-D crystalline arrays. Helical reconstruction of microtubule-MAP or motor complexes has been extremely successful but by definition, all helical 3-D reconstruction attempts require perfectly helical assemblies, which presents a serious limitation and confines the attempts to 15- or 16-protofilament microtubules, microtubule configurations that are very rare in nature. The rise of cryo-electron tomography within the last few years has now opened a new avenue towards solving 3-D structures of microtubule-MAP complexes that do not form helical assemblies, most importantly for the subject here, all microtubules that exhibit a lattice seam. In addition, not all motor domains or MAPs decorate the microtubule surface regularly enough to match the underlying microtubule lattice, or they adopt conformations that deviate from helical symmetry. Here we demonstrate the power and limitation of cryo-electron tomography using two kinesin motor domains, the monomeric Eg5 motor domain, and the heterodimeric Kar3Vik1 motor. We show here that tomography does not exclude the possibility of post-tomographic averaging when identical sub-volumes can be extracted from tomograms and in both cases we were able to reconstruct 3-D maps of conformations that are not possible to obtain using helical or other averaging-based methods.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Prior to our work, structure analysis from electron microscope images of the thin filament has largely involved either helical averaging defined by the underlying actin helix or the use of single particle analysis but using a starting model as a reference structure. Our single particle based approach yields an accurate structure for the complete thin filament by avoiding the loss of information from troponin and tropomyosin associated with helical averaging and also removing the potential reference bias associated with the use of a starting model.

TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiate an intracellular kinase cascade to trigger an immediate defensive response. SIGIRR (single immunoglobulin interleukin-1 receptor-related molecule), another member of the TLR/IL-1R superfamily, acts as a negative regulator of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling. It attenuates the recruitment of MyD88 adaptors to the receptors with its intracellular TIR domain. Thus, SIGIRR is a highly important molecule for the therapy of autoimmune diseases caused by TLRs. So far, the structural mechanism of interactions between SIGIRR, TLRs and adaptor molecules is unclear. To develop a working hypothesis for this interaction, we constructed three-dimensional models for the TIR domains of TLR4, TLR7, MyD88 and SIGIRR based on computational modeling. Through protein-protein docking analysis, we developed models of essential complexes involved in the TLR4 and 7 signaling and the SIGIRR inhibiting processes. We suggest that SIGIRR may exert its inhibitory effect through blocking the molecular interface of TLR4, TLR7 and the MyD88 adaptor mainly via its BB-loop region.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

We determined the 1.9A crystal structure of the PINCH2 LIM1 domain complexed with the ARD of ILK, and show that disruption of this interface by point mutagenesis reduces binding in vitro and alters localization of PINCH2 in cells. These studies provide further evidence for the role of the PINCH LIM1 domain in association with ILK and highlight direct competition as one mechanism for regulating which PINCH isoform predominates in IPP complexes.

Together, these three classes account for all possible ways of building an icosahedral structure solely from trisymmetrons and pentasymmetrons. Also, every icosahedral lattice with odd T number has solutions from exactly two of these three classes, with the set of allowed classes dependent on which of the two lattice parameters is odd. For symmetric lattices (if h=k or h=0), the two solutions yield the same symmetron sizes, but when the lattice parameters are equal (h=k) the solutions can be distinguished by the relative orientations of the symmetrons.

Single molecule studies have revealed that dynein on its own can also act as a processive motor (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006; Toba et al., 2006). However, these studies did not allow the detection of a non-processive motor function. Previous studies based on the transport of vesicles or liposomes indicated that processive transport could only be achieved by an ensemble of motor molecules (Schroer & Sheetz, 1991; Wang and Sheetz, 2000; Muresan et al., 2001). Here we use the three bead dumbbell assay to show for the first time, that cytoplasmic dynein is a non-processive motor at low ATP concentrations.

Radiation damage increases with the number of electrons used to obtain an image and affects information at higher spatial frequencies before low-resolution information. For the experimentalist, a balance exists between electron exposures sufficient to obtain a useful signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in images and exposures that limit the damage to structural features. In single particle cryo-EM this balance is particularly delicate: low-resolution features must be imaged with a sufficient SNR to allow image alignment so that high-resolution features recorded below the noise level can be recovered by averaging independent images. By measuring the fading of Fourier components from images obtained at 200 kV of thin crystals of catalase embedded in ice, we have determined the electron exposures that will maximize the SNR at resolutions between 86 and 2.9A. These data allow for a rational choice of exposure for single particle cryo-EM. For example, for 20A resolution, the SNR is maximized at approximately 20e(-)/A(2), whereas for 3A resolution, it is maximized at approximately 10 e(-)/A(2).

Bacillus subtilis PPO (bsPPO) is unique among PPO family members in that it is a soluble monomer, is inefficiently inhibited by the herbicide acifluorfen (AF) and has broader substrate specificity than other PPO enzymes. Here, we present the crystal structure of bsPPO bound to AF. Our structure shows that the AF molecule binds to a new site outside the previously identified inhibitor binding pocket. Most importantly, the benzene ring of the 2-nitrobenzoic acid moiety of AF lies parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD at a distance of less than 3.5A, providing a framework for the interaction of FAD with the substrate protoporphyrinogen IX. Furthermore, our structure reveals that the larger substrate binding chamber and predominantly positively charged chamber surface of bsPPO are more favorable for the binding of coproporphyrinogen-III.

 Abstract
 
 The structures of snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) are proposed to be useful models to understand the structural and functional relationship of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) which are membrane-anchored proteins involved in multiple human diseases. We have purified, sequenced and determined the structures of two new P-III SVMPs – atragin and kaouthiagin-like (K-like) from Naja atra. Atragin exhibits a known C-shaped topology, whereas K-like adopts an I-shaped conformation because of the distinct disulfide pattern in the disintegrin-like (D) domain. K-like exhibits an enzymatic specificity toward pro-TNFα with less inhibition of cell migration, but atragin shows the opposite effect. The specificity of the enzymatic activity is indicated to be dominated mainly by the local structures of SVMP in the metalloprotease (M) domain, whereas the hyper-variable region (HVR) in the cysteine-rich (C) domain is involved in a cell-migration activity. We demonstrate also a pH-dependent enzymatic activity of atragin that we correlate with the structural dynamics of a Zn2+-binding motif and the Met-turn based on the structures determined with a pH-jump method. The structural variations between the C- and I-shapes highlight the disulfide bond patterns in the D domain of the ADAM/adamalysin/reprolysins family proteins.

It is a tripartite protein with a central PPIase domain surrounded by N- and C-terminal sub-domains (NTD and CTD). Here, the Par27 structure was characterized by X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering and template-based modeling. In the crystal lattice, Par27 consists of alternating well ordered and poorly ordered domains. The PPIase domains gave rise to diffuse scattering and could not be solved, whereas a 2.2A resolution crystal structure was obtained for the NTD and CTD, revealing a cradle-shaped dimeric platform. Despite a lack of sequence similarity with corresponding sub-domains, the topology of the peptide chain in the NTD/CTD core is similar to that of other monomeric PPIase/chaperones such as SurA and trigger factor from Escherichia coli. In Par27, dimerization occurs by sub-domain swapping. Because of the strong amino acid sequence similarity to other parvulin domains, a model for the Par27 PPIase domain was built by template-based modeling and validated against small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data. A model of the full-length dimeric Par27 structure was built by rigid-body modeling and filtering against SAXS data using the partial crystal structure of the NTD/CTD core and the template-based PPIase model. The flexibility of protein was accounted for by representing the structure as an ensemble of different conformations that collectively reproduce the scattering data. The refined models exhibit a cradle-like shape reminiscent of other PPIase/chaperones, and the variability in the orientation of the PPIase domains relative to the NTD/CTD core platform observed in the different models suggests inter-domain flexibility that could be important for the biological activity of this protein.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Synchrotron radiation sources deliver very intense X-ray photon fluxes within micro- or submicro cross-section beams, resulting in doses larger than the MGy. The relevance of synchrotron radiation analyses of biological materials is therefore questionable since such doses, million times higher than the ones used in radiotherapy, can cause huge damages in tissues, with regard to not only DNA, but also proteic and lipid organizations. Very few data concerning the effect of very high X-ray doses in tissues are available in the literature. We present here an analysis of the structural phenomena which occur when the model tissue of human hair is irradiated by a synchrotron X-ray micro-beam. The choice of hair is supported by its hierarchical and partially ordered keratin structure which can be analysed inside the tissue by X-ray diffraction. To assess the damages caused by hard X-ray micro-beams (1 microm(2) cross-section), short exposure time scattering SAXS/WAXS patterns have been recorded at beamline ID13 (ESRF) after various irradiation times. Various modifications of the scattering patterns are observed, they provide fine insight of the radiation damages at various hierarchical levels and also unexpectedly provide information about the stability of the various hierarchical structural levels. It appears that the molecular level, i.e. the alpha helices which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and the alpha-helical coiled coils which are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, is more sensitive to radiation than the supramolecular architecture of the keratin filament and the filament packing within the keratin associated proteins matrix, which is stabilized by disulphide bonds.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Ab initio estimates of the 3D structure are often obtained by the ""Angular Reconstitution"" method, in which a coordinate system is established from three projections, and the orientation of the particle giving rise to each image is deduced from common lines among the images. However, a reliable detection of common lines is difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the images. In this paper we describe a global self-correcting voting procedure in which all projection images participate to decide the identity of the consistent common lines. The algorithm determines which common line pairs were detected correctly and which are spurious. We show that the voting procedure succeeds at relatively low detection rates and that its performance improves as the number of projection images increases.

To address these issues we performed a three-dimensional investigation of fibrous collagen and elastin architecture in the peripheral and central human cornea using synchrotron X-ray scattering and non-linear microscopy. This showed that the network of collagen fibrils circumscribing the human cornea is located in the posterior one-third of the tissue and is interlaced with significant numbers of mature elastic fibres which mirror the alignment of the collagen. The orthogonal arrangement of collagen in the central cornea is also mainly restricted to the posterior stromal layers.

Negative effects of radiation damage are attenuated by cooling specimens to cryogenic temperatures using liquid nitrogen or liquid helium.

Knowledge of how synapses set and regulate their pr is a fundamental step in understanding synaptic transmission and communication between neurons. Despite its importance, pr is difficult to measure directly at single synapses. One important strategy to achieve this has relied on the application of fluorescence-based imaging methods, but this is always limited by the lack of detailed information on the morphological and structural properties of the individual synapses under study, and thus precludes an investigation of the relationship between pr and synaptic anatomy. Here we outline a powerful methodology based on using FM-styryl dyes, photoconversion and correlative ultrastructural analysis in dissociated hippocampal cultured neurons, which provides both a direct readout of pr as well as nanoscale detail on synaptic organization and structure. We illustrate the value of this approach by investigating, at the level of individual reconstructed terminals, the relationship between release probability and defined vesicle pools. We show that in our population of synapses, pr is highly variable, and while it is positively correlated with the number of vesicles docked at the active zone it shows no relationship with the total number of synaptic vesicles. The lack of a direct correlation between total synaptic size and performance in these terminals suggests that factors other than the absolute magnitude of the synapse are the most important determinants of synaptic efficacy.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The global architecture of the protein is reminiscent of that of the amidohydrolase superfamily, consisting of two domains; an (alpha/beta)(8) TIM-like barrel domain, where the catalytic centre is located, and a smaller beta-sheet sandwich domain of unknown function. The c-terminal tails of each subunit extend toward another monomer in a swapping-like manner, creating a hydrogen bond network which suggests its implication in protein oligomerisation. Mutational and structural evidence suggest the involvement of a conserved tyrosine in the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. SmelDhp presents both hydantoinase and dihydropyrimidinase activities, with higher affinity for the natural six-membered ring substrates.

Mutations of the two Cys residues can significantly impair the binding ability of hCutC with Cu(I).

The two isoforms, which differ in sequence by only two amino acid residues (Phe124>Ile and Lys128>Glu), display significant differences in toxicity and anticoagulant properties and act on protein targets including neurotoxic proteic receptors and coagulation factor Xa with significantly different strengths of binding. In order to characterize the structural basis of these functional differences, we have determined the crystal structures of the two isoforms. Comparison of the structures shows that the mutation Lys128>Glu in AtxC could perturb interactions with FXa, resulting in lower anticoagulant activity, since the side chain of Glu128 is partly buried, making a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the main-chain nitrogen atom of residue Thr35. This interaction leads to a displacement of the main polypeptide chain at positions 127 and 128 (identified by mutagenesis as important for interaction with FXa), and a different orientation of the side chain of unmutated Lys127. The mutation Phe124>Ile in AtxC induces no significant conformational changes, suggesting that the differences in toxicity of the two isoforms are due essentially to differences in surface complementarity in the interaction of the toxin with the neurotoxic protein receptor. The crystal structures also reveal a novel dimeric quaternary association involving significant hydrophobic interactions between the N-terminal alpha-helices of two molecules of ammodytoxin related by crystallographic symmetry. Interactions at the dimer interface include important contributions from Met7, which is unique to ammodytoxin. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments are consistent with the crystallographic model. Competition experiments using SPR technology show complete inhibition of AtxA binding to FXa by calmodulin (CaM).

Hypericin has been attracting a growing attention of the pharmaceutical industry because of its potential application in various therapies, including the treatment of depression. In vivo, hypericin is synthesized by dimerization of emodin in a complicated multistep reaction that is reportedly catalyzed by a small (17.8kDa) protein, Hyp-1. Based on relatively low sequence similarity ( approximately 50%), Hyp-1 has been tentatively classified as a plant PR-10 (pathogenesis-related class 10) protein. Members of the PR-10 family are ubiquitous plant proteins associated with stress control and tissue differentiation but with no clearly understood molecular mechanism. They have, however, a well-defined folding canon, consisting of an extended antiparallel beta-sheet wrapped around a C-terminal alpha-helix, enclosing in the protein interior a huge cavity, in which various hydrophobic ligands can be bound.

In this paper, we report a high-resolution crystal structure of Hyp-1, confirming that it indeed has a PR-10 fold.

The adsorption behavior of amelogenin proteins onto substrates is very important because protein-surface interactions are critical to its function. We have previously used LRAP, a splice variant of amelogenin, as a model protein for the full-length amelogenin in solid-state NMR and neutron reflectivity studies at interfaces. In this work, we examined the adsorption behavior of LRAP in greater detail using model self-assembled monolayers containing COOH, CH(3), and NH(2) end groups as substrates. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments indicated that LRAP in phosphate buffered saline and solutions containing low concentrations of calcium and phosphate consisted of aggregates of nanospheres. Null ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to study protein adsorption amounts and quaternary structures on the surfaces. Relatively high amounts of adsorption occurred onto the CH(3) and NH(2) surfaces from both buffer solutions. Adsorption was also promoted onto COOH surfaces only when calcium was present in the solutions suggesting an interaction that involves calcium bridging with the negatively charged C-terminus. The ellipsometry and AFM studies revealed that LRAP adsorbed onto the surfaces as small subnanosphere-sized structures such as monomers or dimers. We propose that the monomers/dimers were present in solution even though they were not detected by DLS or that they adsorbed onto the surfaces by disassembling or ""shedding"" from the nanospheres that are present in solution. This work reveals the importance of small subnanosphere-sized structures of LRAP at interfaces.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In this article we describe a new manner by which water affects biomolecular behaviors, called halogen-water-hydrogen bridge (XWH bridge), that is, one hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) in water-mediated H-bond bridge is replaced by halogen bonding (X-bonding). Although behaving similarly to water-mediated H-bond motif, the XWH bridge usually stands in multifurcated forms and possesses stronger directionality. Quantum mechanical analysis on several model and real systems reveals that the XWH bridges are more thermodynamically stable than other water-involved interactions, and this stability is further enhanced by the cooperation of X-bonding and H-bonding. Crystal structure survey clearly demonstrates the significance of XWH bridges in stabilization of biomolecular conformations and in mediation of protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, and receptor-ligand recognition and binding. These findings shed light into the potential value of XWH bridges in drug design and biological engineering.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

From a series of biochemical studies, it has been found that L-PGDS has an ability to bind a variety of lipophilic ligands such as biliverdin, bilirubin and retinoids in vitro. Therefore, we considered that it is necessary to clarify the molecular structure of L-PGDS upon binding ligand in order to understand the physiological relevance of L-PGDS as a transporter protein. We investigated a molecular structure of L-PGDS/biliverdin complex by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and multi-dimensional NMR measurements, and characterized the binding mechanism in detail. SAXS measurements revealed that L-PGDS has a globular shape and becomes compact by 1.3A in radius of gyration on binding biliverdin. NMR experiments revealed that L-PGDS possessed an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel forming a central cavity. Upon the titration with biliverdin, some cross-peaks for residues surrounding the cavity and EF-loop and H2-helix above the beta-barrel shifted, and the intensity of other cross-peaks decreased with signal broadenings in (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra. These results demonstrate that L-PGDS holds biliverdin within the beta-barrel, and the conformation of the loop regions above the beta-barrel changes upon binding biliverdin. Through such a conformational change, the whole molecule of L-PGDS becomes compact.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Producing good quality vitreous cryo-sections, however, is challenging. Here, we focused on the major obstacles to success: contamination in and around the microtome, and attachment of the ribbon of sections to an electron microscopic grid support film. The conventional method for attaching sections to the grid has involved mechanical force generated by a crude stamping or pressing device, but this disrupts the integrity of vitreous cryo-sections. Furthermore, attachment is poor, and parts of the ribbon of sections are often far from the support film. This results in specimen instability during image acquisition and subsequent difficulty with aligning projection images. Here, we have implemented a protective glove box surrounding the cryo-ultramicrotome that reduces the humidity around and within the microtome during sectioning. We also introduce a novel way to attach vitreous cryo-sections to an EM grid support film using electrostatic charging. The ribbon of vitreous cryo-sections remains in place during transfer and storage and is devoid of stamping related artefacts. We illustrate these improvements by exploring the structure of putative cellular 80S ribosomes within 50nm, vitreous cryo-sections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Studies indicate significant stress relaxation, considered important for optimising tissue stiffness. However, whilst this behaviour is well documented, the mechanisms associated with the response are largely unknown. This study investigates the sub-structural mechanisms occurring during stress relaxation at both the macro (fibre) and nano (fibril) levels of the tendon hierarchy. Stress relaxation followed a two-stage exponential behaviour, during which structural changes were visible at the fibre and fibril levels. Fibril relaxation and fibre sliding showed a double exponential response, while fibre sliding was clearly the largest contributor to relaxation. The amount of stress relaxation and sub-structural reorganisation increased with increasing load increments, but fibre sliding was consistently the largest contributor to stress relaxation. A simple model of tendon viscoelasticity at the fibril and fibre levels has been developed, capturing this behaviour by serially coupling a Voigt element (collagen fibril), with two Maxwell elements (non-collagenous matrix between fibrils and fibres). This multi-level analysis provides a first step towards understanding how sub-structural interactions contribute to viscoelastic behaviour. It indicates that nano- and micro-scale shearing are significant dissipative mechanisms, and the kinetics of relaxation follows a two-stage exponential decay, well fitted by serially coupled viscoelastic elements.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Each series is first aligned individually, an affine transformation is determined to bring the two series in a unique reference system, and all experimental coordinates are combined in a single system of equations. In case of severe shrinkage, a global and a local refinement of the orientation parameters are performed to correct all minors misalignments. The strategy is illustrated on tomographic experiments performed on sections from plastic-embedded biological samples. The efficiency in correcting the misalignment of gold particles and in improving the quality of the reconstruction is documented both visually and quantitatively. In our approach every region of the tomogram is associated with its own orientation parameters and can be eventually reconstructed with the preferred algorithm. This is convenient in the computation of 3D averages of equivalent structures.

As conformational changes are often observed in biological molecules, these techniques need to take into account the flexibility of proteins. Flexibility has been described in terms of movement between rigid domains and between rigid secondary structure elements, which present some limitations for studying dynamical properties. Normal mode analysis has also been used, but is limited to medium resolution data. All-atom molecular dynamics fitting techniques are more appropriate to fit structures into higher-resolution data as full protein flexibility is considered, but are cumbersome in terms of computational time. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained approach; a Go-model was used to represent biological molecules, combined with biased molecular dynamics to reproduce accurately conformational transitions. Illustrative examples on simulated data are shown. Accurate fittings can be obtained for resolution ranging from 5 to 20A. The approach was also tested on experimental data of Elongation Factor G and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, where its validity is compared to previous models obtained from different techniques. This comparison demonstrates that quantitative flexible techniques, as opposed to manual docking, need to be considered to interpret low-resolution data.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Complete backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained from triple-resonance experiments, after which structure calculations were performed and ultimately refined by restrained molecular simulation in water. We find that, in contrast with the dimer of complexes observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, global correlation times and buoyant molecular weight determinations of the complex and its individual components showed the monomeric nature of all species in solution. The NMR-derived structure of K2(Pg) in complex with VEK-30 presents a folding pattern typical of other kringle domains, while bound VEK-30 forms an end-to-end alpha-helix (residues 6-27) in the complex. Most of the VEK-30/K2(Pg) interactions in solution occur between a single face of the alpha-helix of VEK-30 and the lysine binding site (LBS) of K2(Pg). The canonical LBS of K2(Pg), consisting of Asp54, Asp56, Trp60, Arg69, and Trp70 (kringle numbering), interacts with an internal pseudo-lysine of VEK-30, comprising side-chains of Arg17, His18, and Glu20. Site-specific mutagenesis analysis confirmed that the electrostatic field formed by the N-terminal anionic residues of the VEK-30 alpha-helix, viz., Asp7, and the non-conserved cationic residues of K2(Pg), viz., Lys43 and Arg55, play additional important roles in the docking of VEK-30 to K2(Pg). Structural analysis and kringle sequence alignments revealed several important features related to exosite binding that provide a structural rationale for the high specificity and affinity of VEK-30 for K2(Pg).",True,Journal of structural biology,False

We studied the effects of a deficiency of histone methyltransferase, SUV39h, and trichostatin A-dependent hyperacetylation on the structural stability of centromeric clusters, called chromocentres. We did not observe the expected disintegration of chromocentres, but both SUV39h deficiency and hyperacetylation in SUV39h+/+ cells induced the re-positioning of chromocentres closer to the nuclear periphery. Conversely, TSA treatment of SUV39h-/- cells re-established normal nuclear radial positioning of chromocentres. This structural re-arrangement was likely caused by several epigenetic events at centromeric heterochromatin. In particular, reciprocal exchanges between H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, DNA methylation, and HP1 protein levels influenced chromocentre nuclear composition. For example, H3K9me1 likely substituted for the function of H3K9me3 in chromocentre nuclear arrangement and compaction. Our results illustrate the important and interchangeable roles of epigenetic marks for chromocentre integrity. Therefore, we propose a model for epigenetic regulation of nuclear stability of centromeric heterochromatin in the mouse genome.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Both complementary analyses show that Ser and Thr in the g- conformation induce and/or stabilize a structural distortion in the helix backbone. Using quantum mechanical calculations, we have attributed this effect to the electrostatic repulsion between the side chain Ogamma atom of Ser and Thr and the backbone carbonyl oxygen at position i-3. In order to minimize the repulsive force between these negatively charged oxygens, there is a modest increase of the helix bend angle as well as a local opening of the helix turn preceding Ser/Thr. This small distortion can be amplified through the helix, resulting in a significant displacement of the residues located at the other side of the helix. The crystal structures of aquaporin Z and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor are used to illustrate these effects. Ser/Thr-induced structural distortions can be implicated in processes as diverse as ligand recognition, protein function and protein folding.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

In particular, it is well established that the T2S system requires the function of a pilus-like structure, called pseudopilus, which is built upon assembly of pilin-like subunits, called pseudopilins. Pilins and pseudopilins have a hydrophobic N-terminal region, which precedes an extended hydrophilic C-terminal region. In the case of pilins, it was shown that oligomerisation and formation of helical fibers, takes place through interaction between the hydrophobic domains. XcpT, is the most abundant protein of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T2S, and was proposed to be the main component in the pseudopilus. In this study we present the high-resolution NMR structure of the hydrophilic domain of XcpT (XcpTp). XcpTp is lacking the C-terminal disulfide bridged ""D"" domain found in type IV pilins and likely involved in receptor binding. This is in agreement with the idea that the XcpT-containing pseudopilus is required for protein secretion and not for bacterial attachment.

Using UV excitation, fluorescence spectra of normal and compression wood sections showed significant differences, especially in the outer secondary cell wall of tracheids, with a shift in maxima from violet to blue wavelengths between normal and compression wood. A comparison of normal wood, mild and severe compression wood, showed that the wavelength shift was intermediate in the mild compression wood compared to the severe compression wood, thus offering the possibility of quantifying the severity by measuring ratios of fluorescence at violet and blue wavelengths. Fluorescence induced by blue light, rather than UV, was less well differentiated amongst wood types. Spectral deconvolution indicated the presence of a minimum of five discrete lignin fluorophores in the cell walls of both normal and compression wood tracheids.

To achieve higher resolution, it is critical to determine the CTF and correct its phase inversions. However, the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the defocus gradient in the projections of tilted specimens make this process challenging. Two programs, CTFPLOTTER and CTFPHASEFLIP, have been developed to address these issues. CTFPLOTTER obtains a 1D power spectrum by periodogram averaging and rotational averaging and it estimates the noise background with a novel approach, which uses images taken with no specimen. The background-subtracted 1D power spectra from image regions at different defocus values are then shifted to align their first zeros and averaged together. This averaging improves the SNR sufficiently that it becomes possible to determine the defocus for subsets of the tilt series rather than just the entire series. CTFPHASEFLIP corrects images line-by-line by inverting phases appropriately in thin strips of the image at nearly constant defocus. CTF correction by these methods is shown to improve the resolution of aligned, averaged particles extracted from tomograms.

The rhynchonelliformea produce calcitic shells while the linguliformea produce chitinophosphatic shells. Dorsal and ventral valves, commissure and hinge of the calcitic shell of M. truncata show different nanohardness values (from 2.3 to 4.6 GPa) and E-modulus (from 52 to 76 GPa). The hardness of the biocalcite is always increased compared to inorganic calcite. We attribute the effects to different amounts of inter- and intracrystalline organic matrix. Profiles parallel to the radius of curvature of the valves cutting through the different layers of shell material surprisingly show quite uniform values of nanohardness and modulus of elasticity. Nanoindentation tests on the chitinophosphatic brachiopods D. stella and L. anatina reflect the hierarchical structure composed of laminae with varying degree of mineralization. As a result of the two-phase composite of biopolymer nanofibrils reinforced with Ca-phosphate nanoparticles, nanohardness, and E-modulus correlate almost linearly from (H=0.25 GPa, E=2.5 GPa) to (H=2.5 GPa, E=50 GPa). The mineral provides stiffness and hardness, the biopolymer provides flexibility; and the composite provides fracture toughness. Gradients in the degree of mineralization reduce potential stress concentrations at the interface between stiff mineralized and soft non-mineralized laminae. For the epibenthic chitinophosphatic D. stella the lamination is also present but less pronounced than for the infaunal L. anatina, and the overall distribution of material strength in the cross-sectional profile shows a maximum in the center and a decrease towards the inner and outer shell margins (modulus of elasticity from 30 to 12 GPa, hardness from 1.7 to 0.5 GPa). Accordingly, the two epibenthic forms, calcitic M. truncata and chitinophosphatic D. stella display fairly bulky (homogeneous) nanomechanical properties of their shell materials, while the burrowing infaunal L. anatina is distinctively laminated. The strongly mineralized laminae, which provide the strength to the shell, are also brittle, but keeping them as thin as possible, allows some bending flexibility. This flexibility is not required for the epibenthic life style.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

It is the second most inherited kidney disease in the US, and many other symptoms are associated with the disease, including hearing loss and ocular lesions. Here we probe the molecular level structure-property relationships of this disease using a bottom-up computational materiomics approach implemented through large-scale molecular dynamics simulation. Since the GBM is under constant mechanical loading due to blood flow, changes in mechanical properties due to amino acid mutations may be critical in the symptomatic GBM breakdown seen in Alport Syndrome patients. Through full-atomistic simulations in explicit solvent, the effects of single-residue glycine substitution mutations of varying clinical severity are studied in short segments of type IV tropocollagen molecules. The segments with physiological amino acid sequences are equilibrated and then subjected to tensile loading. Major changes are observed at the single molecule level of the mutated sequence, including a bent shape of the structures after equilibration (with the kink located at the mutation site) and a significant alteration of the molecules' stress-strain responses and stiffnesses. These results suggest that localized structural changes at amino acid level induce severe alterations of the molecular properties.

The complexity and variety of diatom cell wall structures exceeds those possible with synthetic materials chemistry approaches. Understanding the design and assembly processes involved in diatom silicification should provide insight into patterning on the unicellular level, and information for biomimetic approaches for materials synthesis. In this report we examine the formation of distinct cell wall structures (valves and girdle bands) in the diatom Cyclotella cryptica by high resolution imaging using SEM, AFM, and fluorescence microscopy. Special attention was paid to imaging structural intermediates, which provided insight into the underlying design and assembly principles involved. Distinct stages in valve formation were identified, indicating a transition from a fractally organized structure to a dynamic pathway-dependent process. Substructures in the valves appeared to be pre-positioned prior to complete silicification, suggesting that organics responsible for these structures were pre-assembled and put in place. Microtubules and microfilamentous actin play significant roles in the positioning process, and actin is also important in the pathway-dependent expansion of the front of silicification. Our results indicate that even though all silica structures in C. cryptica are made of assemblies of nanoparticulate silica, control of meso- and microscale structure occurs on a higher order. It is apparent that diatoms integrate bottom up and top down control and synthesis mechanisms to form the diversity of structures possible.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

This activatable complex consists of a membranous heterodimeric flavocytochrome b, a small G-protein Rac1/Rac2 and cytosolic factors, p47(phox), p67(phox) and p40(phox). p67(phox), due to its modular structure, is the NADPH oxidase component for which global structure information is most scarce despite its mandatory role in activation and its central position in the whole complex organization. Indeed, p67(phox) is the only factor establishing interaction with all others. In this study, we report the SAXS analysis of p67(phox). Our data reveals that p67(phox) behaves as a multidomain protein with semi-flexible linkers. On the one hand, it appears to be a very elongated molecule with its various domains organized as beads on a string. Linkers are predicted to be partially or mainly unstructured and features of our experimental data do point towards inter-domain flexibility. On the other hand, our work also suggests that the protein is not as extended as unstructured linkers could allow, thereby implying the existence of intra-molecular interactions within p67(phox). We suggest that the dual character of p67(phox) conformation in solution is central to ensure the numerous interactions to be accommodated.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The study used 40 donated normal human femoral condyles, from which paraffin-embedded sections were prepared after fixation and decalcification. The histomorphology of the CCZ were qualitatively and quantitatively observed by staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. The hyaline cartilage and CCZ were stained red with Safranin-O, and the subchondral bone was stained blue with Fast green. CCZ was stained black after von Kossa staining. The hyaline cartilage was interlocked tightly in the manner of ""ravine-engomphosis"" by the CCZ. The surface roughnesses of tidemark and cement line were 1.14+/-0.04 and 1.99+/-0.38. The maximum, minimum and mean thicknesses of CCZ were 277.12+/-8.6, 9.83+/-6.72 and 104.162+/-0.87 microm, respectively. The cell density of CCZ (51.25+/-21.26 cells/mm(2)) was significantly lower than that of the hyaline cartilage (152.54+/-35.77 cells/mm(2)) (P<0.05). The subchondral bone was anchored tightly in the manner of a ""comb-anchor"" by the CCZ in our 3D reconstruction model.

Previously, the structure of gamma-TuSC was determined by single particle electron microscopy (EM) at 25A resolution. gamma-TuSC is Y-shaped with a single flexible arm that could be the key to regulating MT nucleation. EM gold labeling revealed the locations of gamma-tubulin at the top of the Y. In vivo Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) suggested the relative orientations of Spc98p and Spc97p but did not distinguish which large subunit formed the flexible arm. Here, using fluorescent proteins as covalently attached tags, we used class averages and 3-D random conical tilt reconstructions to confirm the in vivo FRET results, clearly demonstrating that the Spc98p/97p C-termini interact directly with gamma-tubulin. Most significantly we have determined that the flexible arm belongs to Spc98p and our data also suggests that the N-termini of Spc98p and Spc97p are crossed.

We revealed the structure of the motor complex at 4.6-nm resolution by sub-volume averaging of cryo-electron tomograms and subsequently imposing rotational symmetry. This allowed direct visualisation of individual motor components, the connection between the stator and the peptidoglycan as well as filamentous linkers between the stator and the rod. Two different motor assemblies seem to co-exist at a single bacterial pole.

The ensemble of myosin motors displays heterogeneous conformations reflecting different mechanochemical steps of the ATPase pathway. We used electron tomography of actively contracting insect flight muscle fast-frozen, freeze substituted, Araldite embedded, thin-sectioned and stained, to obtain 3D snapshots of the multiplicity of actin-attached myosin structures. We describe procedures for alignment of the repeating lattice of sub-volumes (38.7 nm cross-bridge repeats bounded by troponin) and multivariate data analysis to identify self-similar repeats for computing class averages. Improvements in alignment and classification of repeat sub-volumes reveals (for the first time in active muscle images) the helix of actin subunits in the thin filament and the troponin density with sufficient clarity that a quasiatomic model of the thin filament can be built into the class averages independent of the myosin cross-bridges. We show how quasiatomic model building can identify both strong and weak myosin attachments to actin.

The binding of NADPH to one subunit of the homodimeric structure triggered a 10 degrees rotation and resulting in a 7A movement of the coenzyme-binding domain. The coenzyme was thus trapped in a closed enzyme conformation, in contrast to the open conformation of the neighboring subunit. Comparison of our Ec/Kp6PGDH structures with those of other species illustrated how the domain conformation can be affected upon binding of the coenzyme, which in turn gives rise to concomitant movements of two important NADP(+)-interacting amino acids, M14 and N102.

The challenge of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy is to rapidly mix reactants, and then, following a defined time interval, to rapidly deposit them as a thin film and freeze the sample to the vitreous state. Here we describe a methodology in which reaction components are mixed and allowed to react, and are then sprayed onto an EM grid as it is being plunged into cryogen. All steps are accomplished by a monolithic, microfabricated silicon device that incorporates a mixer, reaction channel, and pneumatic sprayer in a single chip. We have found that microdroplets produced by air atomization spread to sufficiently thin films on a millisecond time scale provided that the carbon supporting film is made suitably hydrophilic. The device incorporates two T-mixers flowing into a single channel of four butterfly-shaped mixing elements that ensure effective mixing, followed by a microfluidic reaction channel whose length can be varied to achieve the desired reaction time. The reaction channel is flanked by two ports connected to compressed humidified nitrogen gas (at 50 psi) to generate the spray. The monolithic mixer-sprayer is incorporated into a computer-controlled plunging apparatus. To test the mixing performance and the suitability of the device for preparation of biological macromolecules for cryo-EM, ribosomes and ferritin were mixed in the device and sprayed onto grids. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the ribosomes demonstrated retention of native structure, and 30S and 50S subunits were shown to be capable of reassociation into ribosomes after passage through the device.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Spicule growth proceeds by appositional layering of lamellae that consist of silica nanoparticles, which are synthesized via the sponge-specific enzyme silicatein. While in demosponges during maturation the lamellae consolidate to a solid rod, the lamellar organization of hexactinellid spicules largely persists. However, the innermost lamellae, near the spicule core, can also fuse to a solid axial cylinder. Similar to the fusion of siliceous nanoparticles and lamella, in several hexactinellid species individual spicules unify during sintering-like processes. Here, we study the different stages of a process that we termed bio-sintering, within the giant basal spicule (GBS) of Monorhaphis chuni. During this study, a major GBS protein component (27 kDa) was isolated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The sequences were used to isolate and clone the encoding cDNA via degenerate primer PCR. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a significant sequence homology to silicatein. In addition, the native GBS protein was able to mediate bio-silica synthesis in vitro. We conclude that the syntheses of bio-silica in M. chuni, and the subsequent fusion of nanoparticles to lamellae, and finally to spicules, are enzymatically-driven by a silicatein-like protein. In addition, evidence is now presented that in hexactinellids those fusions involve sintering-like processes.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The resolution of this technique is limited by the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope. The CTF is not routinely corrected in cryo-electron tomography because of difficulties including CTF detection, due to the low signal to noise ratio, and CTF correction, since images are characterised by a spatially variant CTF. Here we simulate the effects of the CTF on the resolution of the final reconstruction, before and after CTF correction, and consider the effect of errors and approximations in defocus determination. We show that errors in defocus determination are well tolerated when correcting a series of tomograms collected at a range of defocus values. We apply methods for determining the CTF parameters in low signal to noise images of tilted specimens, for monitoring defocus changes using observed magnification changes, and for correcting the CTF prior to reconstruction.

Highly ordered collagen macromolecules produce second harmonic generation signals without the need for any exogenous label. Conversely, the cellular components stained with exogenous labels generate multiphoton excitation fluorescence signals. Both these signals can be captured simultaneously to provide spatially resolved structural reorganization of a collagen matrix and cells. This study dealt with an in vitro collagen gel contraction model of wound repair, in which fibroblasts are seeded into a 3-dimensional type I collagen matrix. When cells are stimulated to trigger collagen contraction, we found the fibroblasts to be highly elongated as well as interconnected in 2-dimensional space, and the collagen, in the form of a visibly clear fibril structure, accumulated around the cells. In the absence of contraction, on the other hand, the cells were predominantly round in shape and no sign of collagen accumulation around the cell was evident despite the presence of the fibrillar collagen morphology in the matrix.

In Vibrio cholerae, the T2SS secretes several unrelated proteins including the major virulence factor cholera toxin. The T2SS consists of three sub-assemblies, one of which is the Inner Membrane Complex which contains multiple copies of five proteins, including the bitopic membrane protein EpsL. Here, we report the 2.3A resolution crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of EpsL (peri-EpsL) from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which is 56% identical in sequence to its homolog in V. cholerae. The domain adopts a circular permutation of the ""common"" ferredoxin fold with two contiguous sub-domains. Remarkably, this infrequently occurring permutation was for the first time observed in the periplasmic domain of EpsM (peri-EpsM), another T2SS protein which interacts with EpsL. These two domains are 18% identical in sequence which may indicate a common evolutionary origin. Both peri-EpsL and peri-EpsM form dimers, but the organization of the subunits in these dimers appears to be entirely different. We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic domain of EpsL is also dimeric and forms a heterotetramer with the first domain of the ""secretion ATPase"" EpsE. The latter enzyme is most likely hexameric.

Truncation of the RLC N-terminal extension (Dmlc2(Delta2-46)) or disruption of the phosphorylation sites by substituting alanines (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)) decreased the equatorial intensity ratio (I(20)/I(10)), indicating decreased myosin mass associated with the thin filaments. Phosphorylation site disruption (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)), but not N-terminal extension truncation (Dmlc2(Delta2-46)), decreased the 14.5nm reflection intensity, indicating a spread of the axial distribution of the myosin heads. The arrangement of thick filaments and myosin heads in electron micrographs of the phosphorylation mutant (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)) appeared normal in the relaxed and rigor states, but when calcium activated, fewer myosin heads formed cross-bridges. In transgenic flies with both alterations to the RLC (Dmlc2(Delta2-46; S66A, S67A)), the effects of the dual mutation were additive.

Such movements concern the whole calcium-binding pocket and particularly the environment of the coordinating aspartate residue 241.

We approach this question by comparing the deformation pattern and stiffness of intact teeth under load with the deformation pattern and stiffness of the same teeth after the enamel has been mechanically compromised by introducing a defect. FE models of intact human premolars, based on high resolution micro-CT scans, were generated and validated by in vitro electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) experiments. Once a valid FE model was established, we exploit the flexibility of the FE model to gain more insight into whole tooth function. Results show that the enamel cap is an intrinsically stiff biological structure and its morphology dictates the way a whole tooth will mechanically behave under load. The mechanical properties of the enamel cap were sufficient to mechanically maintain almost its entire stiffness function under load even when a small defect (cavity simulating caries) was introduced into its structure and breached the crown integrity. We conclude that for the most part, that enamel and not dentin dictates the mechanical behavior of the whole tooth.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Adaptations to a karst cave biotope.,"Composition and spatial distribution of organic and inorganic materials within the cuticle of isopods vary between species. These variations are related to the behaviour and habitat of the animal. The troglobiotic isopod Titanethes albus lives in the complete darkness of caves in the Slovenian Karst. This habitat provides constant temperature and saturated humidity throughout the year and inconsistent food supply. These conditions should have lead to functional adaptations of arthropod cuticles. However, studies on structure and composition of cave arthropod cuticles are rare and lacking for terrestrial isopods. We therefore analysed the tergite cuticle of T. albus using transmission and field-emission electron microscopy, confocal micro-Raman spectroscopic imaging, quantitative X-ray diffractometry, thermogravimetric analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The ultrastructure of the epicuticle suggests a poor resistance against water loss. A weak interconnection between the organic and mineral phase within the endo- and exocuticle, a comparatively thin apical calcite layer, and almost lack of magnesium within the calcite crystal lattice suggest that the mechanical strength of the cuticle is low in the cave isopod. This may possibly be of advantage in maintaining high cuticle flexibility and reducing metabolic expenditures.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Here the kch gene is shown to produce two proteins, full-length Kch and the large C-terminal cytosolic domain (the RCK domain). Further, these two proteins are associated at the initial stages of purification. Previous structural studies of full-length Kch claim that the isolated protein forms large aggregates that are not suitable for analysis. The results presented here show that the purified protein sample, although heterogeneous, has one major population with a mass of about 400kDa, implying the presence of two Kch tetramers in a complex form. A three dimensional reconstruction at 25A based on electron microscopy data from negatively stained particles, revealed a 210A long and 95A wide complex in which the two tetrameric Kch units are linked by their RCK domains, giving rise to a large central ring of density. The formation of this dimer of tetramers on expression or during purification, may explain why attempts to reconstitute Kch into liposomes for activity measurements have failed.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Supported membranes are lipid bilayer model membranes with or without reconstituted or native membrane proteins that have been developed to study numerous structural and functional properties of cell membranes. A key feature of supported membranes is that despite their stable attachment to solid substrates, they retain the fluidity of biological membranes. To commemorate this event, we have assembled in this Special Issue a collection of 23 primary research and review articles that illuminate how diversified this field has become. A PubMed search on “supported membrane” or “supported bilayer” returned 10,118 entries on July 1, 2009. Therefore, it is not feasible to provide a comprehensive overview on how far this field has proliferated over the past quarter century in this dedicated issue. Rather, the highlighted topics are somewhat selective, but we still hope that they convey the excitement that continues to exist in this field since its inception. For those who would like to read still more about the subject, we recommend a number of recent comprehensive reviews that each emphasize different aspects of supported membrane research ranging from studies of the lateral dynamic structure of membranes to the remodeling of cell membranes in signal transduction and cell adhesion (Castellana and Cremer 2006; Chan and Boxer 2007; Groves et al, 2008; Kiessling et al, 2009). 
 
The articles in this Special Issue are organized around four specific themes. The first seven papers deal with the remodeling of membranes by proteins. The series starts out with an engineered model system to introduce nano-structured barriers in membranes. Membrane-attached actin filaments can provide such barriers as discussed in the following paper. Membranes may be perturbed by peptides, which may be monitored by combined optical and atomic force microscopy or sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy. Two more papers in this group describe how protein dimerization may be studied in supported membranes and how lipid enzymes reorganize the lateral structure of membranes. 
 
The next group of papers illustrates how far one of the first applications of supported membranes has been developed, namely the use of supported membranes to measure the binding of proteins to membrane lipids or receptors. The series starts out with thorough treatments of equilibrium binding of multivalent ligands to defined binding sites in membranes and the kinetics of ligand binding to membrane receptors. The binding of the two repeat domain annexin VI is discussed from a kinetic and structural point of view in the next paper. The last two papers in this series deal with the binding, conformation, and topology of amyloid peptides and HIV-derived lipopeptides in membranes. 
 
Several articles discuss methods for preparing cellular membranes on solid supports and how and why such membrane models are useful to study various functions of cell membranes. Cell membrane functions that are discussed in these papers include the redistribution of proteins leading to bacterial cell division, cell adhesion and the activation of immune cells, Lyn kinase redistribution after receptor activation in mast cells, electrophysiological measurements on hemi-gap junctions, and the development of an immunosensor for antibody detection in serum. 
 
The last group of papers introduces several new concepts to engineer complex systems on solid supports that go beyond single supported membranes. The construction of double membranes is discussed using polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids. Two papers discuss different strategies to assemble bilayers on top of specifically tailored “posts” of DNA. Archea have extremely stable surface layer protein lattices that together with lipids and glycans have been used as building blocks for forming complex supramolecular membrane structures on solid supports as reviewed in the penultimate paper and probed by AFM force measurements in the final article of this Special Issue. 
 
As this collection of articles shows, supported membrane technology has expanded to cover many areas that are of interest to structural and cell biologists who wish to better understand biological processes occurring at cell membranes. Just as researchers begin to tackle increasingly complex functions of cell membranes, supported membranes of increasing complexity are being developed to elucidate complex membrane processes such as membrane fusion, membrane fission, morphogenetic signaling, and many more. 
 
In conclusion, we hope that this series of papers will stimulate another quarter century of exciting research using supported membranes as a tool to further explore new structural, dynamical and functional properties of cell membranes and to develop them into numerous practical devices.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

Assembly of the toxin on cell surfaces may be enhanced by two tandem lectin domains, in addition to direct interactions with lipids and cholesterol within the membrane itself. We used single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to generate a low-resolution molecular structure of the detergent-solubilized VCC oligomer to 20A resolution. After confirming a heptameric arrangement of individual protomers, sevenfold averaging around the central pore was utilized to improve the structure. Docking of the previously determined VCC protoxin crystal structure was possible with rigid-body rearrangements between the cytolytic and lectin domains. A second cryoEM reconstruction of a truncated VCC mutant supported the topology of our model in which the carboxyl-terminal lectin domain forms ""spikes"" around the toxin core with the putative carbohydrate receptor-binding site accessible on the surface of the oligomer. This finding points to an assembly mechanism in which lectin domains may remain bound to receptors on the cell surface throughout assembly of the cytolytic toxin core and explains the hemagglutinating activity of purified toxin. Our model provides an insight into the structural rearrangements that accompany VCC-mediated cytolysis and may aid in the engineering of novel pore-forming toxins to attack specific cells towards therapeutic ends.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Embedded in a thick layer of vitreous ice, the viral particles representing the mature form of the virus (MV) were visualized using full-field transmission X-ray tomography. The tomographic reconstructions reveal the viral brick-shaped characteristic structures with a size of 250x270x360nm(3). The X-ray tomograms show the presence of a clearly defined external envelope, together with an inner core surrounded by an internal envelope, including areas with clear differential density, which correlate well with those features previously described for these viral particles using electron microscopy analyses. A quantitative assessment of the resolution attained in X-ray and electron tomograms of the viral particles prepared under the same conditions yields values of 25.7 and 6.7nm half-pitch, respectively. Although the resolution of the X-ray microscope is well above the dimensions of the membranous compartments, the strong differential contrast exhibited makes it possible to precisely reveal them without any contrasting reagent within this small and complex biological sample.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

TDH catalyses the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of l-threonine to 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate, and is one of the first enzymes in this family to be solved by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme is a homo-tetramer, each monomer consisting of 350 amino acids that form two domains; a catalytic domain and a nicotinamide co-factor (NAD(+))-binding domain, which contains an alpha/beta Rossmann fold motif. An extended twelve-stranded beta-sheet is formed by the association of pairs of monomers in the tetramer. TkTDH shows strong overall structural similarity to TDHs from thermophiles and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) from lower life forms, despite low sequence homology, exhibiting the same overall fold of the monomer and assembly of the tetramer. The structure reveals the binding site of the essential co-factor NAD(+) which is present in all subunits. Docking studies suggest a mode of interaction of TDH with 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase, the subsequent enzyme in the pathway for conversion of threonine to glycine. TDH is known to form a stable functional complex with 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate ligase, most probably to shield an unstable intermediate.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

The study focused on the internal structure of the first-stage mineral structures of high Mg calcite (primary, secondary and carinar process plates, prisms) and on morphology of the columns of second-stage mineral (very high Mg calcite) that cement the first-stage material together. Optical micrographs under polarized light revealed contrast in the centers (midlines) of carinar process plates and in prisms in polished sections; staining of primary and carinar process plates revealed significant dye uptake at the plate centers. Demineralization with and without fixation revealed that the midlines of primary and carinar process plates (but not secondary plates) and the centers of prisms differed from the rest of the plate or prism, and SIMS showed proteins concentrated in these plate centers. SEM was used to study the morphology of columns, the fracture surfaces of mature teeth and the 3D morphology of prisms. These observations of internal structures in plates and prisms offer new insight into the mineralization process and suggest an important role for protein inclusions within the first-stage mineral. Some of the 3D structures not reported previously, such as twisted prisms and stacks of carinar process plates with nested wrinkles, may represent structural strengthening strategies.",True,Journal of structural biology,False

In this paper we describe the synthesis and antimicrobial properties of citropin 1.1 and its 18 analogs constituting mostly truncated fragments of citropin 1.1. Moreover, we examined conformational properties of citropin 1.1 and its two analogs, (1-12)citropin and (1-13)[Ala(4)]citropin, using FTIR, CD and NMR spectroscopies. Three-dimensional structures of the peptides were determined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with time-averaged (TAV) restraints obtained from NMR spectra measured in micellar concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Earlier investigations showed that in TFE solution, citropin 1.1 is a single helix all along the backbone. However, this structure is not retained in the presence of SDS micelle. In H(2)O/SDS-d(25) solution, citropin 1.1 adopts two alpha-helices in the fragments 4-7 and 10-16, respectively, separated by betaIV-turn at position 8, 9. The (1-12)citropin adopts an alpha-helical structure along the entire backbone. In turn, (1-13)[Ala(4)]citropin demonstrates the tendency to adopt only a short alpha-helix in the middle part. Moreover, the conversion of alpha-helix to 3(10)-helix has been noticed in about 30% of conformations. The 3(10)-helical units could be thermodynamic intermediates during folding and unfolding of the alpha-helical segment of the peptide.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Fourteen hours after fertilization (the trochophore stage), larvae form an incipient shell of 100-150nm thick with a columnar contrast. Selected-area electron diffraction analysis showed a single-crystal aragonite pattern with the c-axis perpendicular to the shell surface. Plan-view TEM analysis suggested that the shell contains high density of {110} twins, which are the origin of the columnar contrast in the cross-sectional images. 72h after fertilization (the veliger stage), the shell grows up to 1.2-1.4mum thick accompanying an additional granular layer between the preexisting layer and embryo to form a distinctive two-layer structure. The granular layer is also composed of aragonite crystals sharing their c-axes perpendicular to the shell surface, but the crystals are arranged with a flexible rotation around the c-axes and not restricted solely to the {110} twin relation. No evidence to suggest the existence of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) was found through the observation. The well-regulated crystallographic properties found in the present sample imply initial shell formation probably via a direct deposition of crystalline aragonite.",False,Journal of structural biology,False

Their adenine polynucleotide glycosylase activity was also determined together with other known RIPs: dianthin 30, PAP-R, momordin I, ricin A chain and saporin-S6. Saporin-S6 releases the highest number of adenine molecules from rat ribosomes, and poly(A), while its efficiency is similar to dianthin 30, bouganin and PAP-R on herring sperm DNA. Measures of the protein synthesis inhibitory activity confirmed that saporin-S6 is the most active. The overall structure of bouganin and lychnin is similar to the other considered RIPs and the typical RIP fold is conserved. The superimpositioning of their C(alpha) atoms highlights some differences in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. A detailed structural analysis indicates that the efficiency of saporin-S6 on various polynucleotides can be ascribed to a negative electrostatic surface potential at the active site and several exposed positively charged residues in the region around that site. These two conditions, not present at the same time in other examined RIPs, could guarantee an efficient interaction with the substrate and an efficient catalysis.",False,Journal of structural biology,False
