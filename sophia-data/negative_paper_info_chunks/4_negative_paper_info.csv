We found that local translation in neurons is powered by mitochondria and not by glycolysis. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that dendritic mitochondria exist as stable compartments of single or multiple filaments. To test if these mitochondrial compartments can serve as local energy supply for synaptic translation, we stimulated individual synapses to induce morphological plasticity and visualized newly synthesized proteins. Depletion of local mitochondrial compartments abolished both the plasticity and the stimulus-induced synaptic translation. These mitochondrial compartments serve as spatially confined energy reserves, as local depletion of a mitochondrial compartment did not affect synaptic translation at remote spines. The length and stability of dendritic mitochondrial compartments and the spatial functional domain were altered by cytoskeletal disruption. These results indicate that cytoskeletally tethered local energy compartments exist in dendrites to fuel local translation during synaptic plasticity.",True,Cell,False

Approaches based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.",True,Cell,False

Here, we demonstrate that METTL13 (methyltransferase-like 13) dimethylation of eEF1A (eukaryotic elongation factor 1A) lysine 55 (eEF1AK55me2) is utilized by Ras-driven cancers to increase translational output and promote tumorigenesis in vivo. METTL13-catalyzed eEF1A methylation increases eEF1A's intrinsic GTPase activity in vitro and protein production in cells. METTL13 and eEF1AK55me2 levels are upregulated in cancer and negatively correlate with pancreatic and lung cancer patient survival. METTL13 deletion and eEF1AK55me2 loss dramatically reduce Ras-driven neoplastic growth in mouse models and in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from primary pancreatic and lung tumors. Finally, METTL13 depletion renders PDX tumors hypersensitive to drugs that target growth-signaling pathways. Together, our work uncovers a mechanism by which lethal cancers become dependent on the METTL13-eEF1AK55me2 axis to meet their elevated protein synthesis requirement and suggests that METTL13 inhibition may constitute a targetable vulnerability of tumors driven by aberrant Ras signaling.",True,Cell,False

We find that some PC in the CNS of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) originate in the gut and produce immunoglobulin A (IgA). Moreover, we show that IgA+ PC are dramatically reduced in the gut during EAE, and likewise, a reduction in IgA-bound fecal bacteria is seen in MS patients during disease relapse. Removal of plasmablast (PB) plus PC resulted in exacerbated EAE that was normalized by the introduction of gut-derived IgA+ PC. Furthermore, mice with an over-abundance of IgA+ PB and/or PC were specifically resistant to the effector stage of EAE, and expression of interleukin (IL)-10 by PB plus PC was necessary and sufficient to confer resistance. Our data show that IgA+ PB and/or PC mobilized from the gut play an unexpected role in suppressing neuroinflammation.",True,Cell,False

We identify a deleterious UBQLN4 mutation in families with an autosomal recessive syndrome reminiscent of genome instability disorders. UBQLN4 deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress and delayed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN4 is phosphorylated by ATM and interacts with ubiquitylated MRE11 to mediate early steps of homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair (HRR). Loss of UBQLN4 leads to chromatin retention of MRE11, promoting non-physiological HRR activity in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, UBQLN4 overexpression represses HRR and favors non-homologous end joining. Moreover, we find UBQLN4 overexpressed in aggressive tumors. In line with an HRR defect in these tumors, UBQLN4 overexpression is associated with PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity. UBQLN4 therefore curtails HRR activity through removal of MRE11 from damaged chromatin and thus offers a therapeutic window for PARP1 inhibitor treatment in UBQLN4-overexpressing tumors.",True,Cell,False

The structure of the cytoplasmic-open state is known, but it has proved difficult to understand the transport mechanism in the absence of a structure in the matrix-open state. Here, we describe the structure of the matrix-open state locked by bongkrekic acid bound in the ADP/ATP-binding site at the bottom of the central cavity. The cytoplasmic side of the carrier is closed by conserved hydrophobic residues, and a salt bridge network, braced by tyrosines. Glycine and small amino acid residues allow close-packing of helices on the matrix side. Uniquely, the carrier switches between states by rotation of its three domains about a fulcrum provided by the substrate-binding site. Because these features are highly conserved, this mechanism is likely to apply to the whole mitochondrial carrier family. Video Abstract",True,Cell,False

Here, we identify conserved intratumoral CD4 and CD8 T cell behaviors in scRNA-seq data from 25 melanoma patients. We discover a large population of CD8 T cells showing continuous progression from an early effector ""transitional"" into a dysfunctional T cell state. CD8 T cells that express a complete cytotoxic gene set are rare, and TCR sharing data suggest their independence from the transitional and dysfunctional cell states. Notably, we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major intratumoral proliferating immune cell compartment and that the intensity of the dysfunctional signature is associated with tumor reactivity.

We created a series of CRISPR-mediated deletions and inversions of a pluripotency-associated topologically associating domain (TAD) in mouse ESCs. CTCF-associated domain boundaries were dispensable for RT. CTCF protein depletion weakened most TAD boundaries but had no effect on RT or A/B compartmentalization genome-wide. By contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites caused a domain-wide early-to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The dispensability of TAD boundaries and the necessity of these ""early replication control elements"" (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and inversions at additional domains. Our results demonstrate that discrete cis-regulatory elements orchestrate domain-wide RT, A/B compartmentalization, TAD architecture, and transcription, revealing fundamental principles linking genome structure and function.",True,Cell,False

We use the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) paradigm to explore the implication of chromatin changes in gene silencing. Using female mouse embryonic stem cells, we initiate XCI by inducing Xist and then monitor the temporal changes in transcription and chromatin by allele-specific profiling. This reveals histone deacetylation and H2AK119 ubiquitination as the earliest chromatin alterations during XCI. We show that HDAC3 is pre-bound on the X chromosome and that, upon Xist coating, its activity is required for efficient gene silencing. We also reveal that first PRC1-associated H2AK119Ub and then PRC2-associated H3K27me3 accumulate initially at large intergenic domains that can then spread into genes only in the context of histone deacetylation and gene silencing. Our results reveal the hierarchy of chromatin events during the initiation of XCI and identify key roles for chromatin in the early steps of transcriptional silencing.",True,Cell,False

Given their promise in adoptive cell therapies for cancer, a deeper understanding of regulatory modules controlling clinically beneficial NK phenotypes is of high priority. We report integrated ""-omics"" analysis of human NK subsets, which revealed super-enhancers associated with gene cohorts that may coordinate NK functions and localization. A transcription factor-based regulatory scheme also emerged, which is evolutionarily conserved and shared by innate and adaptive lymphocytes. For both NK and T lineages, a TCF1-LEF1-MYC axis dominated the regulatory landscape of long-lived, proliferative subsets that traffic to lymph nodes. In contrast, effector populations circulating between blood and peripheral tissues shared a PRDM1-dominant landscape. This resource defines transcriptional modules, regulated by feedback loops, which may be leveraged to enhance phenotypes for NK cell-based therapies.",True,Cell,False

They synthesize a primer that is then extended by DNA polymerases. Archaeoeukaryotic primases require for synthesis a catalytic and an accessory domain, the exact contribution of the latter being unresolved. For the pRN1 archaeal primase, this domain is a 115-amino acid helix bundle domain (HBD). Our structural investigations of this small HBD by liquid- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that only the HBD binds the DNA template. DNA binding becomes sequence-specific after a major allosteric change in the HBD, triggered by the binding of two nucleotide triphosphates. The spatial proximity of the two nucleotides and the DNA template in the quaternary structure of the HBD strongly suggests that this small domain brings together the substrates to prepare the first catalytic step of primer synthesis.

Using Xenopus egg extracts, we previously showed that replication fork collision with DPCs causes their proteolysis, followed by translesion DNA synthesis. We show here that when DPC proteolysis is blocked, the replicative DNA helicase CMG (CDC45, MCM2-7, GINS), which travels on the leading strand template, bypasses an intact leading strand DPC. Single-molecule imaging reveals that GINS does not dissociate from CMG during bypass and that CMG slows dramatically after bypass, likely due to uncoupling from the stalled leading strand. The DNA helicase RTEL1 facilitates bypass, apparently by generating single-stranded DNA beyond the DPC. The absence of RTEL1 impairs DPC proteolysis, suggesting that CMG must bypass the DPC to enable proteolysis. Our results suggest a mechanism that prevents inadvertent CMG destruction by DPC proteases, and they reveal CMG's remarkable capacity to overcome obstacles on its translocation strand.",True,Cell,False

However, it remains controversial whether MHC-II is solely responsible for the inhibitory function of LAG-3.

FGL1 inhibits antigen-specific T cell activation, and ablation of FGL1 in mice promotes T cell immunity. Blockade of the FGL1-LAG-3 interaction by monoclonal antibodies stimulates tumor immunity and is therapeutic against established mouse tumors in a receptor-ligand inter-dependent manner. FGL1 is highly produced by human cancer cells, and elevated FGL1 in the plasma of cancer patients is associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to anti-PD-1/B7-H1 therapy.

Here, we identify conserved ion channels in an enteric serotonergic neuron that mediate its responses to food ingestion and decipher how these responses drive changes in foraging behavior. We show that the C. elegans serotonergic neuron NSM acts as an enteric sensory neuron that acutely detects food ingestion. We identify the novel and conserved acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) DEL-7 and DEL-3 as NSM-enriched channels required for feeding-dependent NSM activity, which in turn drives slow locomotion while animals feed. Point mutations that alter the DEL-7 channel change NSM dynamics and associated behavioral dynamics of the organism.

Here we describe a novel role for p53 in suppressing the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for biosynthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. p53 blocks activation of SREBP-2, the master transcriptional regulator of this pathway, by transcriptionally inducing the ABCA1 cholesterol transporter gene. A mouse model of liver cancer reveals that downregulation of mevalonate pathway gene expression by p53 occurs in premalignant hepatocytes, when p53 is needed to actively suppress tumorigenesis. Furthermore, pharmacological or RNAi inhibition of the mevalonate pathway restricts the development of murine hepatocellular carcinomas driven by p53 loss. Like p53 loss, ablation of ABCA1 promotes murine liver tumorigenesis and is associated with increased SREBP-2 maturation. Our findings demonstrate that repression of the mevalonate pathway is a crucial component of p53-mediated liver tumor suppression and outline the mechanism by which this occurs.",True,Cell,False

Perturb-ATAC in human B lymphocytes uncovered regulators of chromatin accessibility, TF occupancy, and nucleosome positioning and identified a hierarchy of TFs that govern B cell state, variation, and disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. Perturb-ATAC in primary human epidermal cells revealed three sequential modules of cis-elements that specify keratinocyte fate.

All known abasic site repair mechanisms operate only when the damage is in double-stranded DNA. Here, we report the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) binding, ESC-specific (HMCES) as a sensor of abasic sites in single-stranded DNA. HMCES acts at replication forks, binds PCNA and single-stranded DNA, and generates a DNA-protein crosslink to shield abasic sites from error-prone processing. This unusual HMCES DNA-protein crosslink intermediate is resolved by proteasome-mediated degradation. Acting as a suicide enzyme, HMCES prevents translesion DNA synthesis and the action of endonucleases that would otherwise generate mutations and double-strand breaks. HMCES is evolutionarily conserved in all domains of life, and its biochemical properties are shared with its E. coli ortholog. Thus, HMCES is an ancient DNA lesion recognition protein that preserves genome integrity by promoting error-free repair of abasic sites in single-stranded DNA.",True,Cell,False

To understand the relationship between these two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals, we describe the use of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed ""noise"" in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue.

Phage-encoded VqmA (VqmAPhage) binds to host-produced DPO, launching the phage lysis program via an antirepressor that inactivates the phage repressor by sequestration. The antirepressor interferes with repressors from related phages. Like phage VP882, these phages encode DNA-binding proteins and partner antirepressors, suggesting that they, too, integrate host-derived information into their lysis-lysogeny decisions. VqmAPhage activates the host VqmAVc regulon, whereas VqmAVc cannot induce phage-mediated lysis, suggesting an asymmetry whereby the phage influences host QS while enacting its own lytic-lysogeny program without interference.

Heterogeneous activity of the methyltransferase CARM1 during these stages results in differential methylation of histone H3R26 to modulate establishment of these two lineages. Here we show that CARM1 accumulates in nuclear granules at the 2- to 4-cell stage transition in the mouse embryo, with the majority corresponding to paraspeckles. The paraspeckle component Neat1 and its partner p54nrb are required for CARM1’s association with paraspeckles and for H3R26 methylation. Conversely, CARM1 also influences paraspeckle organization.

Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA, LincGET, is transiently and asymmetrically expressed in the nucleus of two- to four-cell mouse embryos. Overexpression of LincGET in one of the two-cell blastomeres biases its progeny predominantly toward the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. Mechanistically, LincGET physically binds to CARM1 and promotes the nuclear localization of CARM1, which can further increase the level of H3 methylation at Arginine 26 (H3R26me), activate ICM-specific gene expression, upregulate transposons, and increase global chromatin accessibility. Simultaneous overexpression of LincGET and depletion of Carm1 no longer biased embryonic fate, indicating that the effect of LincGET in directing ICM lineage depends on CARM1. Thus, our data identify LincGET as one of the earliest known lineage regulators to bias cell fate in mammalian 2-cell embryos.",True,Cell,False

Although pup-directed attacks by males require vomeronasal function, the specific infant cues that elicit this behavior are unknown. We developed a behavioral paradigm based on reconstituted pup cues and showed that discrete infant morphological features combined with salivary chemosignals elicit robust male aggression. Seven vomeronasal receptors were identified based on infant-mediated activity, and the involvement of two receptors, Vmn2r65 and Vmn2r88, in infant-directed aggression was demonstrated by genetic deletion. Using the activation of these receptors as readouts for biochemical fractionation, we isolated two pheromonal compounds, the submandibular gland protein C and hemoglobins. Unexpectedly, none of the identified vomeronasal receptors and associated cues were specific to pups.

In particular, irisin has been shown to have beneficial effects in adipose tissues, brain, and bone. However, the skeletal response to exercise is less clear, and the receptor for irisin has not been identified.

Chemical inhibition of the αV integrins blocks signaling and function by irisin in osteocytes and fat cells. Irisin increases both osteocytic survival and production of sclerostin, a local modulator of bone remodeling. Genetic ablation of FNDC5 (or irisin) completely blocks osteocytic osteolysis induced by ovariectomy, preventing bone loss and supporting an important role of irisin in skeletal remodeling.

Risk VSMCs exhibit globally altered transcriptional networks that intersect with previously identified CAD risk genes and pathways, concomitant with aberrant adhesion, contraction, and proliferation. Unexpectedly, deleting the risk haplotype rescues VSMC stability, while expressing the 9p21.3-associated long non-coding RNA ANRIL induces risk phenotypes in non-risk VSMCs.

We investigated the history of this strain by combining phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses of the bacterial genome, detailed archaeological information, and genomic analyses from infected individuals and hundreds of ancient human samples across Eurasia.

Neural precursor cell dysfunction and white matter dysfunction are thought to contribute to this debilitating syndrome.

Developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapy-induced neurological dysfunction, we find a similar depletion of white matter OPCs, increased but incomplete OPC differentiation, and a persistent deficit in myelination. OPCs from chemotherapy-naive mice similarly exhibit increased differentiation when transplanted into the microenvironment of previously methotrexate-exposed brains, indicating an underlying microenvironmental perturbation. Methotrexate results in persistent activation of microglia and subsequent astrocyte activation that is dependent on inflammatory microglia. Microglial depletion normalizes oligodendroglial lineage dynamics, myelin microstructure, and cognitive behavior after methotrexate chemotherapy.

However, only a minority of patients respond to these immunotherapies. Here, we report that blocking the inhibitory NKG2A receptor enhances tumor immunity by promoting both natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell effector functions in mice and humans. Monalizumab, a humanized anti-NKG2A antibody, enhanced NK cell activity against various tumor cells and rescued CD8+ T cell function in combination with PD-x axis blockade. Monalizumab also stimulated NK cell activity against antibody-coated target cells. Interim results of a phase II trial of monalizumab plus cetuximab in previously treated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck showed a 31% objective response rate. Most common adverse events were fatigue (17%), pyrexia (13%), and headache (10%).

However, the QS signal “stumpy induction factor” (SIF) and its reception mechanism are unknown. Although trypanosomes lack G protein-coupled receptor signaling, we have identified a surface GPR89-family protein that regulates stumpy formation. TbGPR89 is expressed on bloodstream “slender form” trypanosomes, which receive the SIF signal, and when ectopically expressed, TbGPR89 drives stumpy formation in a SIF-pathway-dependent process. Structural modeling of TbGPR89 predicts unexpected similarity to oligopeptide transporters (POT), and when expressed in bacteria, TbGPR89 transports oligopeptides. Conversely, expression of an E. coli POT in trypanosomes drives parasite differentiation, and oligopeptides promote stumpy formation in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of secreted trypanosome oligopeptidases generates a paracrine signal that accelerates stumpy formation in vivo.

The GLI1 transcription factor must maintain maximal Hedgehog pathway output in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and we have previously shown that resistant BCCs increase GLI1 deacetylation through atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (aPKC) and HDAC1. Here we identify a lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) isoform-dependent nuclear chaperoning system that regulates GLI1 movement between the nuclear lamina and nucleoplasm to achieve maximal activation. LAP2β forms a two-site interaction with the GLI1 zinc-finger domain and acetylation site, stabilizing an acetylation-dependent reserve on the inner nuclear membrane (INM). By contrast, the nucleoplasmic LAP2α competes with LAP2β for GLI1 while scaffolding HDAC1 to deacetylate the secondary binding site. aPKC functions to promote GLI1 association with LAP2α, promoting egress off the INM.

Here, we address these questions by developing a strain of influenza A virus amenable to rapid compositional characterization through quantitative, site-specific labeling of viral proteins. Using this strain, we find that influenza A produces virions with broad variations in size and composition from even single infected cells.

TFEB functions cell-autonomously through PUMA induction and Bax-Bak activation to promote programmed cell death of a subset of premyelinating oligodendrocytes, allowing selective elimination of oligodendrocytes in normally unmyelinated brain regions.

Aberrant heteromerization of AT1-B2 led to exaggerated calcium signaling and high vascular smooth muscle mechanosensitivity, which could explain the onset of preeclampsia symptoms at late-stage pregnancy as mechanical forces increase with fetal mass. AT1-B2 receptor aggregation was inhibited by beta-arrestin-mediated downregulation. Importantly, symptoms of preeclampsia were prevented by transgenic ARRB1 expression or a small-molecule drug.

Here, we use CasDrop, a novel CRISPR-Cas9-based optogenetic technology, to show that various IDPs phase separate into liquid condensates that mechanically exclude chromatin as they grow and preferentially form in low-density, largely euchromatic regions. A minimal physical model explains how this stiffness sensitivity arises from lower mechanical energy associated with deforming softer genomic regions. Targeted genomic loci can nonetheless be mechanically pulled together through surface tension-driven coalescence. Nuclear condensates may thus function as mechano-active chromatin filters, physically pulling in targeted genomic loci while pushing out non-targeted regions of the neighboring genome.

However, the biophysical principles by which phase separation can be precisely localized within subregions of the cell are still largely unclear, particularly for low-abundance proteins. Here, we introduce an oligomerizing biomimetic system, ""Corelets,"" and utilize its rapid and quantitative light-controlled tunability to map full intracellular phase diagrams, which dictate the concentrations at which phase separation occurs and the transition mechanism, in a protein sequence dependent manner. Surprisingly, both experiments and simulations show that while intracellular concentrations may be insufficient for global phase separation, sequestering protein ligands to slowly diffusing nucleation centers can move the cell into a different region of the phase diagram, resulting in localized phase separation. This diffusive capture mechanism liberates the cell from the constraints of global protein abundance and is likely exploited to pattern condensates associated with diverse biological processes.

The prevailing view is that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis or cirrhosis are required for HCC in obesity. Here, we report that NASH and fibrosis and HCC in obesity can be dissociated. We show that the oxidative hepatic environment in obesity inactivates the STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphatase T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) and increases STAT-1 and STAT-3 signaling. TCPTP deletion in hepatocytes promoted T cell recruitment and ensuing NASH and fibrosis as well as HCC in obese C57BL/6 mice that normally do not develop NASH and fibrosis or HCC. Attenuating the enhanced STAT-1 signaling prevented T cell recruitment and NASH and fibrosis but did not prevent HCC. By contrast, correcting STAT-3 signaling prevented HCC without affecting NASH and fibrosis. TCPTP-deletion in hepatocytes also markedly accelerated HCC in mice treated with a chemical carcinogen that promotes HCC without NASH and fibrosis.

At the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) locus, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) class retrotransposed upstream of the agouti coat-color locus, providing an alternative promoter that is variably DNA methylated in genetically identical individuals. This results in variable expressivity of coat color that is inherited transgenerationally. Here, a systematic genome-wide screen identifies multiple C57BL/6J murine IAPs with Avy epigenetic properties. Each exhibits a stable methylation state within an individual but varies between individuals. Only in rare instances do they act as promoters controlling adjacent gene expression. Their methylation state is locus-specific within an individual, and their flanking regions are enriched for CTCF. Variably methylated IAPs are reprogrammed after fertilization and re-established as variable loci in the next generation, indicating reconstruction of metastable epigenetic states and challenging the generalizability of non-genetic inheritance at these regions.",True,Cell,False

CDK9 inhibition dephosphorylates the SWI/SNF protein BRG1, which contributes to gene reactivation. By optimization through gene expression, we developed a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor (MC180295, IC50 = 5 nM) that has broad anti-cancer activity in vitro and is effective in in vivo cancer models.

Ablation of NAT10 reduced ac4C detection at the mapped mRNA sites and was globally associated with target mRNA downregulation. Analysis of mRNA half-lives revealed a NAT10-dependent increase in stability in the cohort of acetylated mRNAs. mRNA acetylation was further demonstrated to enhance substrate translation in vitro and in vivo.

Mechanistically, meal-associated rise in circulating secretin activates BAT thermogenesis by stimulating lipolysis upon binding to secretin receptors in brown adipocytes, which is sensed in the brain and promotes satiation. Chronic infusion of a modified human secretin transiently elevates energy expenditure in diet-induced obese mice. Clinical trials with human subjects showed that thermogenesis after a single-meal ingestion correlated with postprandial secretin levels and that secretin infusions increased glucose uptake in BAT.

TIS granules form a reticular meshwork intertwined with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The association between TIS granules and the ER creates a subcellular compartment-the TIGER domain-with a biophysically and biochemically distinct environment from the cytoplasm.

Here we demonstrate that sensory food perception is sufficient to elicit early activation of hepatic mTOR signaling, Xbp1 splicing, increased expression of ER-stress genes, and phosphatidylcholine synthesis, which translate into a rapid morphological ER remodeling. These responses overlap with those activated during refeeding, where they are maintained and constantly increased upon nutrient supply. Sensory food perception activates POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, optogenetic activation of POMC neurons activates hepatic mTOR signaling and Xbp1 splicing, whereas lack of MC4R expression attenuates these responses to sensory food perception. Chemogenetic POMC-neuron activation promotes sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) subserving the liver, and norepinephrine evokes the same responses in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver in vivo as observed upon sensory food perception.

To understand budding yeast evolution, we analyzed the genomes of 332 yeast species, including 220 newly sequenced ones, which represent nearly one-third of all known budding yeast diversity. Here, we establish a robust genus-level phylogeny comprising 12 major clades, infer the timescale of diversification from the Devonian period to the present, quantify horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and reconstruct the evolution of 45 metabolic traits and the metabolic toolkit of the budding yeast common ancestor (BYCA). We infer that BYCA was metabolically complex and chronicle the tempo and mode of genomic and phenotypic evolution across the subphylum, which is characterized by very low HGT levels and widespread losses of traits and the genes that control them.

In contrast, fibroblast membranes are dynamic during homeostasis and extend to fill the space of lost neighboring fibroblasts in a Rac1-dependent manner. Positional stability is sustained during aging despite a progressive accumulation of gaps in fibroblast nuclei organization, while membrane occupancy continues to be maintained.

Reconstitution studies of β1AR biogenesis narrowed the EMC requirement to the co-translational insertion of the first transmembrane domain (TMD). Without EMC, a proportion of TMD1 inserted in an inverted orientation or failed altogether. Purified EMC and SRP receptor were sufficient for correctly oriented TMD1 insertion, while the Sec61 translocon was necessary for insertion of the next TMD. Enforcing TMD1 topology with an N-terminal signal peptide bypassed the EMC requirement for insertion in vitro and restored efficient biogenesis of multiple GPCRs in EMC-knockout cells.

First we defined the subnetworks that influence intrinsic brain dynamics by identifying regions that showed coordinated changes in spectral coherence. The most common subnetwork, found in 13 of 21 subjects, was characterized by β-frequency coherence (13-30 Hz) between the amygdala and hippocampus. Increased variability of this subnetwork correlated with worsening mood across these 13 subjects. Moreover, these subjects had significantly higher trait anxiety than the 8 of 21 for whom this amygdala-hippocampus subnetwork was absent.

The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. Perturbations to tension propagate diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient Dσ ∼0.024 μm2/s in HeLa cells.

This was associated with altered chromatin accessibility and gene expression, including decreased PIK3IP1 in Th1 cells that sensitized to IL-2-mediated mTORC1 signaling. In vivo, GLS null T cells failed to drive Th17-inflammatory diseases, and Th1 cells had initially elevated function but exhausted over time.

Using electron cryotomography, we show that each CdiA effector protein forms a filament extending ∼33 nm from the cell surface. Remarkably, the extracellular filament represents only the N-terminal half of the effector. A programmed secretion arrest sequesters the C-terminal half of CdiA, including the toxin domain, in the periplasm prior to target-cell recognition. Upon binding receptor, CdiA secretion resumes, and the periplasmic FHA-2 domain is transferred to the target-cell outer membrane. The C-terminal toxin region of CdiA then penetrates into the target-cell periplasm, where it is cleaved for subsequent translocation into the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that the FHA-2 domain assembles into a transmembrane conduit for toxin transport into the periplasm of target bacteria.

Patients with mitochondrial disease have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies with and without the harmful mutation, and it is the percentage of mutated mtDNA copies, also referred to as the ‘‘heteroplasmic ratio,’’ which determines disease incidence and severity. Clinical symptoms typically appear when more than 60% of mtDNA is mutated and the higher this percentage, themore severe the disease.

Pro-Code-expressing vectors were introduced into cells and analyzed by CyTOF mass cytometry. Using just 14 antibodies, we detected 364 Pro-Code populations; establishing the largest set of protein-based reporters. By pairing each Pro-Code with a different CRISPR, we simultaneously analyzed multiple phenotypic markers, including phospho-signaling, on dozens of knockouts. Pro-Code/CRISPR screens found two interferon-stimulated genes, the immunoproteasome component Psmb8 and a chaperone Rtp4, are important for antigen-dependent immune editing of cancer cells and identified Socs1 as a negative regulator of Pd-l1.

Optogenetic approaches using light-sensitive microbial rhodopsins have permitted manipulations to reach a level of temporal precision that is enabling functional circuit dissection. As demand for more precise perturbations to serve specific experimental goals increases, a palette of opsins with diverse selectivity, kinetics, and spectral properties will be needed. Here, we introduce a novel approach of ""topological engineering""-inversion of opsins in the plasma membrane-and demonstrate that it can produce variants with unique functional properties of interest for circuit neuroscience. In one striking example, inversion of a Channelrhodopsin variant converted it from a potent activator into a fast-acting inhibitor that operates as a cation pump. Our findings argue that membrane topology provides a useful orthogonal dimension of protein engineering that immediately permits as much as a doubling of the available toolkit.",True,Cell,False

Unbiased assessment of gene expression of tumor-infiltrating cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and longitudinal assessment of cellular protein expression by mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed significant remodeling of both the lymphoid and myeloid intratumoral compartments. Surprisingly, we observed multiple subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages, distinguishable by the markers CD206, CX3CR1, CD1d, and iNOS, that change over time during ICT in a manner partially dependent on IFNγ.

To date, the modular organization and pathways of assembly of these chromatin regulators remain unknown, presenting a major barrier to structural and functional determination. Here, we elucidate the architecture and assembly pathway across three classes of mSWI/SNF complexes-canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF), polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and newly defined ncBAF complexes-and define the requirement of each subunit for complex formation and stability. Using affinity purification of endogenous complexes from mammalian and Drosophila cells coupled with cross-linking mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and mutagenesis, we uncover three distinct and evolutionarily conserved modules, their organization, and the temporal incorporation of these modules into each complete mSWI/SNF complex class.

The prevailing view is that neural cells are initially induced with anterior (forebrain) identity; caudalizing signals then convert a proportion to posterior fates (spinal cord). To test this model, we used chromatin accessibility to define how cells adopt region-specific neural fates. Together with genetic and biochemical perturbations, this identified a developmental time window in which genome-wide chromatin-remodeling events preconfigure epiblast cells for neural induction. Contrary to the established model, this revealed that cells commit to a regional identity before acquiring neural identity. This “primary regionalization” allocates cells to anterior or posterior regions of the nervous system, explaining how cranial and spinal neurons are generated at appropriate axial positions. These findings prompt a revision to models of neural induction and support the proposed dual evolutionary origin of the vertebrate CNS.",True,Cell,False

Multiple strands of evidence suggest that much of the remaining heritability is also due to additive effects of common variants rather than epistasis between these variants or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in 68,379 cases and controls that up to 5% of this heritability is explained by low-frequency variation in gene coding sequence. We identify four novel genes driving MS risk independently of common-variant signals, highlighting key pathogenic roles for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFNγ biology, and NFκB signaling.

Here, we report the discovery that bacteria also employ ADP-ribosylating toxins against each other during interspecies competition. We demonstrate that one such toxin from Serratia proteamaculans interrupts the division of competing cells by modifying the essential bacterial tubulin-like protein, FtsZ, adjacent to its protomer interface, blocking its capacity to polymerize. The structure of the toxin in complex with its immunity determinant revealed two distinct modes of inhibition: active site occlusion and enzymatic removal of ADP-ribose modifications. We show that each is sufficient to support toxin immunity; however, the latter additionally provides unprecedented broad protection against non-cognate ADP-ribosylating effectors.

Using a custom-built hardware and software infrastructure, CLOC monitors, in real time, the output of a pathway deleted for a feedback regulator. A minimal model uses these measurements to calculate and deliver-on the fly-an optogenetically enabled transcriptional input designed to compensate for the effects of the feedback deletion.

We infer the underlying bursting kinetics and identify the key regulatory parameter as the fraction of time a gene is in a transcriptionally active state. Unexpectedly, both the rate of polymerase initiation and the switching rates are tightly constrained across all expression levels, predicting synchronous patterning outcomes at all positions in the embryo.

We show that in addition to the motor properties the natural asymmetry between microtubule plus- and minus-end growth critically contributes to the organizational potential of the motors.

Here, we compare humans with natural-selective bilateral BLA lesions to rats with a chemogenetically silenced BLA. We find, across species, an essential role for the BLA in the selection of active escape over passive freezing during exposure to imminent yet escapable threat (Timm). In response to Timm, BLA-damaged humans showed increased startle potentiation and BLA-silenced rats demonstrated increased startle potentiation, freezing, and reduced escape behavior as compared to controls. Neuroimaging in humans suggested that the BLA reduces passive defensive responses by inhibiting the brainstem via the CeA. Indeed, Timm conditioning potentiated BLA projections onto an inhibitory CeA pathway, and pharmacological activation of this pathway rescued deficient Timm responses in BLA-silenced rats.

Furthermore, consumption of an inulin-enriched high-fat diet induced both dysbiosis and HCC in wild-type (WT) mice. Inulin-induced HCC progressed via early onset of cholestasis, hepatocyte death, followed by neutrophilic inflammation in liver. Pharmacologic inhibition of fermentation or depletion of fermenting bacteria markedly reduced intestinal SCFA and prevented HCC.

While the importance of rate coding is well established, it remains controversial whether temporal codes alone are sufficient for controlling behavior. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of specific temporal codes are enigmatic. Here, we show in Drosophila clock neurons that distinct temporal spike patterns, dissociated from changes in firing rate, encode time-dependent arousal and regulate sleep. From a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the molecular pathways mediating the circadian-dependent changes in ionic flux and spike morphology that rhythmically modulate spike timing. Remarkably, the daytime spiking pattern alone is sufficient to drive plasticity in downstream arousal neurons, leading to increased firing of these cells. These findings demonstrate a causal role for temporal coding in behavior and define a form of synaptic plasticity triggered solely by temporal spike patterns.",True,Cell,False

Here, we investigated the 7q11.23 CNV, whose hemideletion causes Williams syndrome (WS), and uncovered that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in WS pathogenesis. Dysfunction is facilitated in part by the 7q11.23 protein DNAJC30, which interacts with mitochondrial ATP-synthase machinery. Removal of Dnajc30 in mice resulted in hypofunctional mitochondria, diminished morphological features of neocortical pyramidal neurons, and altered behaviors reminiscent of WS. The mitochondrial features are consistent with our observations of decreased integrity of oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes and ATP-synthase dimers in WS.

However, previous findings from bats have questioned these proposals by reporting absence of theta rhythmicity in bat hippocampal formation. Does this mean that temporal coding is unique to rodent hippocampus and does not generalize to other species? Here, we report that, surprisingly, bat hippocampal neurons do exhibit temporal coding similar to rodents, albeit without any continuous oscillations at the 1-20 Hz range. Bat neurons exhibited very strong locking to the non-rhythmic fluctuations of the field potential, such that neurons were synchronized together despite the absence of oscillations. Further, some neurons exhibited ""phase precession"" and phase coding of the bat's position-with spike phases shifting earlier as the animal moved through the place field. This demonstrates an unexpected type of neural coding in the mammalian brain-nonoscillatory phase coding-and highlights the importance of synchrony and temporal coding for hippocampal function across species.",True,Cell,False

Genetic evidence of neoantigen depletion was observed in the sites with high Immunoscore and spatial proximity between Ki67+ tumor cells and CD3+ cells. The immunoedited tumor clones were eliminated and did not recur, while progressing clones were immune privileged, despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Characterization of immune-privileged metastases revealed tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of escape. The lowest recurrence risk was associated with high Immunoscore, occurrence of immunoediting, and low tumor burden.

Here, we show that, unlike wild-type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. The centromere promotes chromosome condensation strictly in cis through recruiting the kinases Aurora B and Bub1, which trigger the autonomous condensation of the entire chromosome. Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading the condensation signal to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin in a centromere-dependent manner, excluding from this process non-centromeric DNA and thereby inhibiting their propagation.",True,Cell,False

Flavivirus-primed CD8+ T cells promote these phenotypes, as their absence diminished enteric neuron injury and intestinal transit delays, and their adoptive transfer reestablished dysmotility after flavivirus infection. Remarkably, mice surviving acute flavivirus infection developed chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility that was exacerbated by immunization with an unrelated alphavirus vaccine or exposure to a non-infectious inflammatory stimulus. This model of chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal dysmotility in mice suggests that viral infections with tropism for enteric neurons and the ensuing immune response might contribute to the development of bowel motility disorders in humans.

With the use of newly generated mouse models, we show that neighboring endothelial cells (ECs) transfer cav1-containing EVs to adipocytes in vivo, which reciprocate by releasing EVs to ECs. AT-derived EVs contain proteins and lipids capable of modulating cellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, this mechanism facilitates transfer of plasma constituents from ECs to the adipocyte.

We found that enterocytes at villus bottoms express an anti-bacterial gene program in a microbiome-dependent manner. They next shift to sequential expression of carbohydrates, peptides, and fat absorption machineries in distinct villus compartments. Finally, they induce a Cd73 immune-modulatory program at the villus tips. Our approach can be used to uncover zonation patterns in other organs when prior knowledge of landmark genes is lacking.",True,Cell,False

We found that lipophilic statin drugs and rationally designed bisphosphonates that target three distinct enzymes in the mevalonate pathway have potent adjuvant activities in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. These inhibitors function independently of conventional ""danger sensing."" Instead, they inhibit the geranylgeranylation of small GTPases, including Rab5 in antigen-presenting cells, resulting in arrested endosomal maturation, prolonged antigen retention, enhanced antigen presentation, and T cell activation. Additionally, inhibiting the mevalonate pathway enhances antigen-specific anti-tumor immunity, inducing both Th1 and cytolytic T cell responses. As demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models, the mevalonate pathway inhibitors are robust for cancer vaccinations and synergize with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our research thus defines the mevalonate pathway as a druggable target for vaccine adjuvants and cancer immunotherapies.",True,Cell,False

In mouse M1-ipRGCs, by far the best-studied subtype, melanopsin activates PLCβ4 (phospholipase C-β4) to open TRPC6,7 channels, mechanistically similar to phototransduction in fly rhabdomeric (microvillous) photoreceptors. We report here that, surprisingly, mouse M4-ipRGCs rely on a different and hitherto undescribed melanopsin-driven, ciliary phototransduction mechanism involving cyclic nucleotide as the second messenger and HCN channels rather than CNG channels as the ion channel for phototransduction. Even more surprisingly, within an individual mouse M2-ipRGC, this HCN-channel-dependent, ciliary phototransduction pathway operates in parallel with the TRPC6,7-dependent rhabdomeric pathway. These findings reveal a complex heterogeneity in phototransduction among ipRGCs and, more importantly, break a general dogma about segregation of the two phototransduction motifs, likely with strong evolutionary implications.",True,Cell,False

MHC-II-restricted CD4+ T cells also drive anti-tumor responses, but their relation to neoantigen selection and tumor evolution has not been systematically studied. Modeling the potential of an individual's MHC-II genotype to present 1,018 driver mutations in 5,942 tumors, we demonstrate that the MHC-II genotype constrains the mutational landscape during tumorigenesis in a manner complementary to MHC-I. Mutations poorly bound to MHC-II are positively selected during tumorigenesis, even more than mutations poorly bound to MHC-I. This emphasizes the importance of CD4+ T cells in anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we observed less inter-patient variation in mutation presentation for MHC-II than for MHC-I. These differences were reflected by age at diagnosis, which was correlated with presentation by MHC-I only. Collectively, our results emphasize the central role of MHC-II presentation in tumor evolution.",True,Cell,False

However, current methods of genetic mapping have limited resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput genome editing approach that can introduce thousands of specific genetic variants in a single experiment. This enabled us to study the fitness consequences of 16,006 natural genetic variants in yeast. We identified 572 variants with significant fitness differences in glucose media; these are highly enriched in promoters, particularly in transcription factor binding sites, while only 19.2% affect amino acid sequences. Strikingly, nearby variants nearly always favor the same parent's alleles, suggesting that lineage-specific selection is often driven by multiple clustered variants.

However, the relevant gut-brain neuronal circuitry remains unknown. We show that optical activation of gut-innervating vagal sensory neurons recapitulates the hallmark effects of stimulating brain reward neurons. Specifically, right, but not left, vagal sensory ganglion activation sustained self-stimulation behavior, conditioned both flavor and place preferences, and induced dopamine release from Substantia nigra. Cell-specific transneuronal tracing revealed asymmetric ascending pathways of vagal origin throughout the CNS. In particular, transneuronal labeling identified the glutamatergic neurons of the dorsolateral parabrachial region as the obligatory relay linking the right vagal sensory ganglion to dopamine cells in Substantia nigra. Consistently, optical activation of parabrachio-nigral projections replicated the rewarding effects of right vagus excitation. Our findings establish the vagal gut-to-brain axis as an integral component of the neuronal reward pathway.

However, it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here, we describe a mechanism for transcription-associated homologous recombination repair (TA-HRR) in human cells. The process is initiated by R-loops formed upon DSB induction. We identify Rad52, which is recruited to the DSB site in a DNA-RNA-hybrid-dependent manner, as playing pivotal roles in promoting XPG-mediated R-loop processing and initiating subsequent repair by HRR. Importantly, dysfunction of TA-HRR promotes DSB repair via non-homologous end joining, leading to a striking increase in genomic aberrations. Thus, our data suggest that the presence of R-loops around DSBs within transcriptionally active regions promotes accurate repair of DSBs via processing by Rad52 and XPG to protect genomic information in these critical regions from gene alterations.",True,Cell,False

In mammals and invertebrates, learned fear responses can be suppressed by experiencing predictive cues without punishment, a process called memory extinction. Here, we show that extinction of aversive memories in Drosophila requires specific dopaminergic neurons, which indicate that omission of punishment is remembered as a positive experience. Functional imaging revealed co-existence of intracellular calcium traces in different places in the mushroom body output neuron network for both the original aversive memory and a new appetitive extinction memory. Light and ultrastructural anatomy are consistent with parallel competing memories being combined within mushroom body output neurons that direct avoidance. Indeed, extinction-evoked plasticity in a pair of these neurons neutralizes the potentiated odor response imposed in the network by aversive learning. Therefore, flies track the accuracy of learned expectations by accumulating and integrating memories of conflicting events.",True,Cell,False

However, its source is unclear. Here, we report that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis and key node in central carbon metabolism, quantitatively generates acetate in mammals. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the context of nutritional excess, such as during hyperactive glucose metabolism. Conversion of pyruvate to acetate occurs through two mechanisms: (1) coupling to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (2) neomorphic enzyme activity from keto acid dehydrogenases that enable function as pyruvate decarboxylases. Further, we demonstrate that de novo acetate production sustains Ac-CoA pools and cell proliferation in limited metabolic environments, such as during mitochondrial dysfunction or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) deficiency. By virtue of de novo acetate production being coupled to mitochondrial metabolism, there are numerous possible regulatory mechanisms and links to pathophysiology.",True,Cell,False

However, components of canonical autophagy play roles in other biological processes, adding complexity to this goal. One such alternative function of autophagy proteins is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which functions in phagosome maturation and subsequent signaling events. Here, we show that impairment of LAP in the myeloid compartment, rather than canonical autophagy, induces control of tumor growth by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon phagocytosis of dying tumor cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that defects in LAP induce pro-inflammatory gene expression and trigger STING-mediated type I interferon responses in TAM. We found that the anti-tumor effects of LAP impairment require tumor-infiltrating T cells, dependent upon STING and the type I interferon response.

The crystal structure of the central domain of Aster-A broadly resembles the sterol-binding fold of mammalian StARD proteins, but sequence differences in the Aster pocket result in a distinct mode of ligand binding. The Aster N-terminal GRAM domain binds phosphatidylserine and mediates Aster recruitment to plasma membrane-ER contact sites in response to cholesterol accumulation in the plasma membrane.

TMCC1 concentrates at the ER-endosome MCSs that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome fission. When TMCC1 is depleted, endosome morphology is normal, buds still form, but ER-associated bud fission and subsequent cargo sorting to the Golgi are impaired. We find that the endosome-localized actin regulator Coronin 1C is required for ER-associated fission of actin-dependent cargo-sorting domains. Coronin 1C is recruited to endosome buds independently of TMCC1, while TMCC1/ER recruitment requires Coronin 1C. This link between TMCC1 and Coronin 1C suggests that the timing of TMCC1-dependent ER recruitment is tightly regulated to occur after cargo has been properly sequestered into the bud.",True,Cell,False

We now show that caspase-2, whose expression is ER-stress inducible and elevated in human and mouse NASH, controls the buildup of hepatic-free cholesterol and triglycerides by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) in a manner refractory to feedback inhibition. Caspase-2 colocalizes with site 1 protease (S1P) and cleaves it to generate a soluble active fragment that initiates SCAP-independent SREBP1/2 activation in the ER. Caspase-2 ablation or pharmacological inhibition prevents diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression in ER-stress-prone mice. Caspase-2 inhibition offers a specific and effective strategy for preventing or treating stress-driven fatty liver diseases, whereas caspase-2-generated S1P proteolytic fragments, which enter the secretory pathway, are potential NASH biomarkers.",True,Cell,False

When I entered the field of histone biology as a postdoc, a rich older literature suggested that histone proteins might be worth a career investment. This was a gamble, but in short, I found histone proteins interesting. While relatively poor in molecular weight, histones were potentially rich in biologically meaningful information, as different gel systems revealed a large variety of patterns in electrophoretic properties. But was any of this heterogeneity physiologically relevant? That histones might be important was supported by their highly conserved nature and their undisputed role as fundamental protein organizers of the chromatin. Well before my time, numerous labs had documented a wealth of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones and hypothesized that these PTMs might alter chromatin structure and function by influencing histone-DNA and histone-histone contacts. Eukaryotic genomes demanded packaging within a chromatin environment, but was this packaging anything more than just nature’s clever way to make sure large genomes fit into tight nuclear spaces? I was hoping that there was more gold left to be mined from these ‘‘simple’’ proteins and their welldocumented covalent decorations.

Here, we present extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as another fundamental node of cell-extrinsic metabolic regulation. Unbiased analysis of glycolytic drivers identified the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor as being among the most highly correlated with glycolysis in cancer. Confirming a mechanistic link between the ECM component hyaluronan and metabolism, treatment of cells and xenografts with hyaluronidase triggers a robust increase in glycolysis. This is largely achieved through rapid receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated induction of the mRNA decay factor ZFP36, which targets TXNIP transcripts for degradation. Because TXNIP promotes internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT1, its acute decline enriches GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. Functionally, induction of glycolysis by hyaluronidase is required for concomitant acceleration of cell migration.

Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1, and CACNA1H) lead to an increased clathrin binding. All three mutations create dileucine motifs known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization and restores glucose transport. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins.

We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration.

In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool.

Gene expression and imaging studies of self-maintaining macrophages revealed distinct transcriptional profiles that reflect their unique localization (i.e., closely positioned to blood vessels, submucosal and myenteric plexus, Paneth cells, and Peyer's patches). Depletion of self-maintaining macrophages resulted in morphological abnormalities in the submucosal vasculature and loss of enteric neurons, leading to vascular leakage, impaired secretion, and reduced intestinal motility.

While the source of photic information affecting mood and cognitive functions is well established, viz. intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the central mediators are unknown. Here, we reveal that the direct effects of light on learning and mood utilize distinct ipRGC output streams. ipRGCs that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mediate the effects of light on learning, independently of the SCN's pacemaker function. Mood regulation by light, on the other hand, requires an SCN-independent pathway linking ipRGCs to a previously unrecognized thalamic region, termed perihabenular nucleus (PHb). The PHb is integrated in a distinctive circuitry with mood-regulating centers and is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior. Together, these results provide new insights into the neural basis required for light to influence mood and learning.",True,Cell,False

Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge.

The molecular mechanisms for coordinated synthesis of these proteins are not understood. Using forward genetic screens, we identified the conserved THO nuclear export complex (THOC) as an important regulator of presynapse development in C. elegans dopaminergic neurons. In THOC mutants, synaptic messenger RNAs are retained in the nucleus, resulting in dramatic decrease of synaptic protein expression, near complete loss of synapses, and compromised dopamine function. CRE binding protein (CREB) interacts with THOC to mark synaptic transcripts for efficient nuclear export. Deletion of Thoc5, a THOC subunit, in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes severe defects in synapse maintenance and subsequent neuronal death in the substantia nigra compacta. These cellular defects lead to abrogated dopamine release, ataxia, and animal death.

Here we describe the development of CKIα inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIα-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIα together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2-/-;Flt3ITD AML mouse models and in several patient-derived AML xenograft models, supporting their potential efficacy in curing human leukemia.",True,Cell,False

We found that during influenza A (IAV) infection, rampant transcription rapidly reorganizes host cell chromatin interactions. These changes occur at the ends of highly transcribed genes, where global inhibition of transcription termination by IAV NS1 protein causes readthrough transcription for hundreds of kilobases. In these readthrough regions, elongating RNA polymerase II disrupts chromatin interactions by inducing cohesin displacement from CTCF sites, leading to locus decompaction. Readthrough transcription into heterochromatin regions switches them from the inert (B) to the permissive (A) chromatin compartment and enables transcription factor binding. Data from non-viral transcription stimuli show that transcription similarly affects cohesin-mediated chromatin contacts within gene bodies. Conversely, inhibition of transcription elongation allows cohesin to accumulate at previously transcribed intragenic CTCF sites and to mediate chromatin looping and compaction.

Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for accurate chromosome segregation. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and this is especially important for maintaining chromosome stability in the polyploid liver. We propose that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie the widespread chromosome instability across epithelial cancers.

The bacteria-secreted enterobactin (Ent) is an iron scavenging siderophore with presumed negative effects on hosts.

We discovered an unexpected and striking role of Ent in supporting growth and the labile iron pool in C. elegans. We show that Ent promotes mitochondrial iron uptake and does so, surprisingly, by binding to the ATP synthase α subunit, which acts inside of mitochondria and independently of ATP synthase. We also demonstrated the conservation of this mechanism in mammalian cells.

We show that TBK1 is an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 and the embryonic lethality of Tbk1-/- mice is dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. In aging human brains, another endogenous RIPK1 inhibitor, TAK1, exhibits a marked decrease in expression. We show that in Tbk1+/- mice, the reduced myeloid TAK1 expression promotes all the key hallmarks of ALS/FTD, including neuroinflammation, TDP-43 aggregation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and behavior deficits, which are blocked upon inhibition of RIPK1. Thus, aging facilitates RIPK1 activation by reducing TAK1 expression, which cooperates with genetic risk factors to promote the onset of ALS/FTD.",True,Cell,False

Critically, the biology of ILCs also extends beyond classical immunology to metabolic homeostasis, tissue remodeling, and dialog with the nervous system. The last 10 years have also contributed to our greater understanding of the transcriptional networks that regulate lymphocyte commitment and delineation. This, in conjunction with the recent advances in our understanding of the influence of local tissue microenvironments on the plasticity and function of ILCs, has led to a re-evaluation of their existing categorization.

From its humble beginnings as a way for bacteria to chop up invading viral DNA, CRISPR has taken over our discussions of animal models, high-throughput screens, GMOs, and gene therapy—even biomedical ethics and scientific patent law—all at breakneck speed. While CRISPR is not without its drawbacks, it has major advantages in that it is programmable and applicable to countless organisms, cell types, and research questions. With over 2,500 CRISPR papers published already in 2018, it’s easy to wonder whether there is anything truly new left under the sun. With CRISPR-mediated genome editing, the CRISPR enzyme makes a cut at the site specified by its guide RNA, and cellular repair processes take over to fix the DNA lesion, often introducing small insertions and deletions or stimulating homologous recombination at the site. This process leads to editing of the DNA sequence, allowing scientists to create point mutations; engineer nucleotide substitutions in regulatory regions; insert tags or reporter genes; or delete exons, genes, or sets of genes, for example. Now, two studies from the labs of Zhongjun Qin and Jef Boeke push the technology to its limits by using CRISPR to fuse entire yeast chromosomes together. Qin and colleagues took advantage of yeast’s superior homologous recombination efficiency to create one single, fused chromosome out of the native 16. Remarkably, the single-chromosome yeast cells had very similar cell growth and transcriptome to wild-type yeast (Shao et al., 2018). In the study by Boeke and colleagues, the authors fused yeast chromosomes to create a two-chromosome yeast strain that is reproductively isolated from wild-type yeast, opening up the question of whether it can be classified as a separate species. Similar to the related paper, they also observed that the yeast cells with this drastically altered karyotype were viable with only slightly reduced growth rate (Luo et al., 2018).

Looking at post-transcriptional regulation, we now show that LINE-1 mRNA 3′ ends are pervasively uridylated in various human cellular models and in mouse testes. TUT4 and TUT7 uridyltransferases catalyze the modification and function in cooperation with the helicase/RNPase MOV10 to counteract the RNA chaperone activity of the L1-ORF1p retrotransposon protein. Uridylation potently restricts LINE-1 retrotransposition by a multilayer mechanism depending on differential subcellular localization of the uridyltransferases. We propose that uridine residues added by TUT7 in the cytoplasm inhibit initiation of reverse transcription of LINE-1 mRNAs once they are reimported to the nucleus, whereas uridylation by TUT4, which is enriched in cytoplasmic foci, destabilizes mRNAs. These results provide a model for the post-transcriptional restriction of LINE-1, revealing a key physiological role for TUT4/7-mediated uridylation in maintaining genome stability.",True,Cell,False

Binding of this frustrated intermediate to TRiC specifies an extended topology of actin with native-like secondary structure. In contrast, GroEL stabilizes bound actin in an unfolded state. ATP binding to TRiC effects an asymmetric conformational change in the chaperonin ring.

The strategies that drive symptomatic or asymptomatic infections remain largely unknown. We took advantage of the concept of lethal dose 50 (LD50) to ask which component of individual non-genetic variation between hosts defines whether they survive or succumb to infection. Using the enteric pathogen Citrobacter, we found no difference in pathogen burdens between healthy and symptomatic populations. Iron metabolism-related genes were induced in asymptomatic hosts compared to symptomatic or naive mice. Dietary iron conferred complete protection without influencing pathogen burdens, even at 1000× the lethal dose of Citrobacter. Dietary iron induced insulin resistance, increasing glucose levels in the intestine that were necessary and sufficient to suppress pathogen virulence. A short course of dietary iron drove the selection of attenuated Citrobacter strains that can transmit and asymptomatically colonize naive hosts, demonstrating that environmental factors and cooperative metabolic strategies can drive conversion of pathogens toward commensalism.",True,Cell,False

These enzymes form a common five-subunit catalytic core whose assembly is critical for their basal and regulated enzymatic activities through unknown mechanisms. Here, we present the crystal structure of the intact yeast COMPASS histone methyltransferase catalytic module consisting of Swd1, Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, and Set1. The complex is organized by Swd1, whose conserved C-terminal tail not only nucleates Swd3 and a Bre2-Sdc1 subcomplex, but also joins Set1 to construct a regulatory pocket next to the catalytic site. This inter-subunit pocket is targeted by a previously unrecognized enzyme-modulating motif in Swd3 and features a doorstop-style mechanism dictating substrate selectivity among SET1/MLL family members. By spatially mapping the functional components of COMPASS, our results provide a structural framework for understanding the multifaceted functions and regulation of the H3K4 methyltransferase family.",True,Cell,False

Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification.

To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs.

Here, we used a biochemical reconstitution approach to show that, both in solution and on supported membrane bilayers, multivalent interaction networks formed by major excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold proteins led to formation of PSD-like assemblies via phase separation. The reconstituted PSD-like assemblies can cluster receptors, selectively concentrate enzymes, promote actin bundle formation, and expel inhibitory postsynaptic proteins.

Subtype specification is initiated prior to the onset of hearing during the time period when auditory circuits mature. Gene mutations linked to deafness that disrupt hair cell mechanotransduction or glutamatergic signaling perturb the firing behavior of SGNs prior to hearing onset and disrupt SGN subtype specification. We thus conclude that an intact hair cell mechanotransduction machinery is critical during the pre-hearing period to regulate the firing behavior of SGNs and their segregation into subtypes.

Based on connectivity and susceptibility to age-related loss, these subtypes correspond to those defined physiologically. Additional intrinsic differences among subtypes and across the tonotopic axis highlight an unexpectedly active role for SGNs in auditory processing.

We find that LINE-derived sequences (LINEs) contribute to this selection by recruiting dozens of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to introns. This includes MATR3, which promotes binding of PTBP1 to multivalent binding sites within LINEs. Both RBPs repress splicing and 3′ end processing within and around LINEs. Notably, repressive RBPs preferentially bind to evolutionarily young LINEs, which are located far from exons. These RBPs insulate the LINEs and the surrounding intronic regions from RNA processing. Upon evolutionary divergence, changes in RNA motifs within LINEs lead to gradual loss of their insulation. Hence, older LINEs are located closer to exons, are a common source of tissue-specific exons, and increasingly bind to RBPs that enhance RNA processing. Thus, LINEs are hubs for the assembly of repressive RBPs and also contribute to the evolution of new, lineage-specific transcripts in mammals. Video Abstract",True,Cell,False

Paradoxically, long (>20 bp) (dA:dT) tracts are also preferential sites of polar replication fork stalling and collapse within early-replicating fragile sites (ERFSs) and late-replicating common fragile sites (CFSs) and at the rDNA replication fork barrier. Poly(dA:dT) sequences are fragile because long single-strand poly(dA) stretches at the replication fork are unprotected by the replication protein A (RPA).

The current structural model for Akt activation by C-terminal phosphorylation has centered on intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal tail and the N lobe of the kinase domain. Here, we employ expressed protein ligation to produce site-specifically phosphorylated forms of purified Akt1 that are well suited for mechanistic analysis. Using biochemical, crystallographic, and cellular approaches, we determine that pSer473-Akt activation is driven by an intramolecular interaction between the C-tail and the pleckstrin homology (PH)-kinase domain linker that relieves PH domain-mediated Akt1 autoinhibition. Moreover, dual phosphorylation at Ser477/Thr479 activates Akt1 through a different allosteric mechanism via an apparent activation loop interaction that reduces autoinhibition by the PH domain and weakens PIP3 affinity.

In many instances, how this is accomplished remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a protein, F17 encoded by cytoplasmically replicating poxviruses, that binds and sequesters Raptor and Rictor, regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. This disrupts mTORC1-mTORC2 crosstalk that coordinates host responses to poxvirus infection. During infection with poxvirus lacking F17, cGAS accumulates together with endoplasmic reticulum vesicles around the Golgi, where activated STING puncta form, leading to interferon-stimulated gene expression. By contrast, poxvirus expressing F17 dysregulates mTOR, which localizes to the Golgi and blocks these antiviral responses in part through mTOR-dependent cGAS degradation. Ancestral conservation of Raptor/Rictor across eukaryotes, along with expression of F17 across poxviruses, suggests that mTOR dysregulation forms a conserved poxvirus strategy to counter cytosolic sensing while maintaining the metabolic benefits of mTOR activity.",True,Cell,False

We find that animals use retromer-dependent Wnt signaling to propagate mitochondrial stress signals from the nervous system to peripheral tissues. Specifically, the polyQ40-triggered activation of mitochondrial stress or reduction of cco-1 (complex IV subunit) in neurons of C. elegans results in the Wnt-dependent induction of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in peripheral cells. Loss-of-function mutations of retromer complex components that are responsible for recycling the Wnt secretion-factor/MIG-14 prevent Wnt secretion and thereby suppress cell-non-autonomous UPRmt. Neuronal expression of the Wnt ligand/EGL-20 is sufficient to induce cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in a retromer complex-, Wnt signaling-, and serotonin-dependent manner, clearly implicating Wnt signaling as a strong candidate for the ""mitokine"" signal.",True,Cell,False

How these proteins are organized to produce endocytic vesicles with high precision and efficiency is not understood. Here, we developed high-throughput superresolution microscopy to reconstruct the nanoscale structural organization of 23 endocytic proteins from over 100,000 endocytic sites in yeast. We found that proteins assemble by radially ordered recruitment according to function. WASP family proteins form a circular nanoscale template on the membrane to spatially control actin nucleation during vesicle formation. Mathematical modeling of actin polymerization showed that this WASP nano-template optimizes force generation for membrane invagination and substantially increases the efficiency of endocytosis. Such nanoscale pre-patterning of actin nucleation may represent a general design principle for directional force generation in membrane remodeling processes such as during cell migration and division.",True,Cell,False

Dps compacts DNA into a dense complex and protects it from damage. Dps has also been proposed to act as a global regulator of transcription. Here, we directly examine the impact of Dps-induced compaction of DNA on the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP). Strikingly, deleting the dps gene decompacted the nucleoid but did not significantly alter the transcriptome and only mildly altered the proteome during stationary phase. Complementary in vitro assays demonstrated that Dps blocks restriction endonucleases but not RNAP from binding DNA. Single-molecule assays demonstrated that Dps dynamically condenses DNA around elongating RNAP without impeding its progress. We conclude that Dps forms a dynamic structure that excludes some DNA-binding proteins yet allows RNAP free access to the buried genes, a behavior characteristic of phase-separated organelles.",True,Cell,False

This suggests that transposons employ specific tactics to accomplish robust propagation. By directly tracking mobilization, we show that, during a short and specific time window of oogenesis, retrotransposons achieve massive amplification via a cell-type-specific targeting strategy. Retrotransposons rarely mobilize in undifferentiated germline stem cells. However, as oogenesis proceeds, they utilize supporting nurse cells-which are highly polyploid and eventually undergo apoptosis-as factories to massively manufacture invading products. Moreover, retrotransposons rarely integrate into nurse cells themselves but, instead, via microtubule-mediated transport, they preferentially target the DNA of the interconnected oocytes. Blocking microtubule-dependent intercellular transport from nurse cells significantly alleviates damage to the oocyte genome. Our data reveal that parasitic genomic elements can efficiently hijack a host developmental process to propagate robustly, thereby driving evolutionary change and causing disease.",True,Cell,False

While activity-dependent processes are critical for the differentiation and circuit assembly of postmitotic neurons, how bioelectrical processes affect nonexcitable cells, such as progenitors, remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that, in the developing mouse neocortex, ventricular zone progenitors become more hyperpolarized as they generate successive subtypes of neurons. Experimental in vivo hyperpolarization shifted the transcriptional programs and division modes of these progenitors to a later developmental status, with precocious generation of intermediate progenitors and a forward shift in the laminar, molecular, morphological, and circuit features of their neuronal progeny. These effects occurred through inhibition of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway by hyperpolarization. Thus, during corticogenesis, bioelectric membrane properties are permissive for specific molecular pathways to coordinate the temporal progression of progenitor developmental programs and thus neocortical neuron diversity.",True,Cell,False

Here, we show that diet-induced obesity (DIO) causes massive remodeling of circadian enhancer activity in mouse liver, triggering synchronous high-amplitude circadian rhythms of both fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation. SREBP expression was rhythmically induced by DIO, leading to circadian FA synthesis and, surprisingly, FA oxidation (FAO). DIO similarly caused a high-amplitude circadian rhythm of PPARα, which was also required for FAO. Provision of a pharmacological activator of PPARα abrogated the requirement of SREBP for FAO (but not FA synthesis), suggesting that SREBP indirectly controls FAO via production of endogenous PPARα ligands. The high-amplitude rhythm of PPARα imparted time-of-day-dependent responsiveness to lipid-lowering drugs. Thus, acquisition of rhythmicity for non-core clock components PPARα and SREBP1 remodels metabolic gene transcription in response to overnutrition and enables a chronopharmacological approach to metabolic disorders.",True,Cell,False

In this study, we uncover a collection of H3K4-modifying chromatin regulators that function with H3K9 and H3K36 regulators to orchestrate TSSGs. Specifically, the H3K4 tri-demethylase KDM5A and specific COMPASS/KMT2 H3K4 methyltransferases modulate different TSSG loci through H3K4 methylation states and KDM4A recruitment.

We have determined the crystal structure of the Rtt109-Asf1-H3-H4 complex and found that unwinding of histone H3 αN, where K56 is normally located, and stabilization of the very C-terminal β strand of histone H4 by Asf1 are prerequisites for H3K56 acetylation. Unexpectedly, an interaction between Rtt109 and the central helix of histone H3 is also required.

This downregulation of gene expression is coupled with epigenetic changes, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that an intronic GAA/TTC triplet expansion within the IIL1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana results in accumulation of 24-nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and repressive histone marks at the IIL1 locus, which in turn causes its transcriptional downregulation and an associated phenotype. Knocking down DICER LIKE-3 (DCL3), which produces 24-nt siRNAs, suppressed transcriptional downregulation of IIL1 and the triplet expansion-associated phenotype. Furthermore, knocking down additional components of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway also suppressed both transcriptional downregulation of IIL1 and the repeat expansion-associated phenotype. Thus, our results show that triplet repeat expansions can lead to local siRNA biogenesis, which in turn downregulates transcription through an RdDM-dependent epigenetic modification.",True,Cell,False

The method targeted a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, PPP1R15B (R15B), a negative regulator of proteostasis. This yielded Raphin1, a selective inhibitor of R15B. In cells, Raphin1 caused a rapid and transient accumulation of its phosphorylated substrate, resulting in a transient attenuation of protein synthesis. In vitro, Raphin1 inhibits the recombinant R15B-PP1c holoenzyme, but not the closely related R15A-PP1c, by interfering with substrate recruitment.

HDX-MS and mutational analysis were used to show how cargo dynamics leads to alternative Arf1 trimerization, directing Nef targets to be either retained at the trans-Golgi or sorted to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of the NL4-3 M-Nef was shown to regulate AP-1 trimerization, explaining how O-Nefs lacking this phosphosite counteract tetherin but most M-Nefs do not.

Males with LC10 neurons silenced are unable to orient toward or maintain proximity to the female and do not predominantly use the ipsilateral wing when singing. LC10 neurons preferentially respond to small moving objects using an antagonistic motion-based center-surround mechanism. Unilateral activation of LC10 neurons recapitulates the orienting and ipsilateral wing extension normally elicited by females, and the potency with which LC10 induces wing extension is enhanced in a state of courtship arousal controlled by male-specific P1 neurons.

We found an association of the aggressive PCa-associated allele G of rs11672691 with elevated transcript levels of two biologically plausible candidate genes, PCAT19 and CEACAM21, implicated in PCa cell growth and tumor progression. Mechanistically, rs11672691 resides in an enhancer element and alters the binding site of HOXA2, a novel oncogenic transcription factor with prognostic potential in PCa. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide editing showed the direct effect of rs11672691 on PCAT19 and CEACAM21 expression and PCa cellular aggressive phenotype. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of rs11672691 genotype and PCAT19/CEACAM21 gene expression on PCa prognosis.

The identification of turbulent energy as a determinant parameter allowed scale-up to 8 L for the generation of 100 billion-order platelets from hiPSC-MKs, which satisfies clinical requirements. Turbulent flow promoted the release from megakaryocytes of IGFBP2, MIF, and Nardilysin to facilitate platelet shedding. hiPSC-platelets showed properties of bona fide human platelets, including circulation and hemostasis capacities upon transfusion in two animal models.

To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance.

Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mouse, chick, and snake embryos and in human cerebral organoids demonstrate that high Slit/Robo and low Dll1 signaling, via Jag1 and Jag2, are necessary and sufficient to drive direct neurogenesis.

Favorable cation-π interactions between arginines and FG-phenylalanines may explain this apparent paradox. Application of these principles to redesign the surface of GFP resulted in variants that show a wide span of transit rates, ranging from 35-fold slower than wild-type to ∼500 times faster, with the latter outpacing even naturally occurring nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). The structure of a fast and particularly FG-specific GFPNTR variant illustrates how NTRs can expose multiple regions for binding hydrophobic FG motifs while evading non-specific aggregation.

Upon pharmacologic inhibition of the CBFβ-SMMHC/RUNX1 interaction, RUNX1 shows increased binding at three MYC distal enhancers, where it represses MYC expression by mediating the replacement of the SWI/SNF complex component BRG1 with the polycomb-repressive complex component RING1B, leading to apoptosis. Combining the CBFβ-SMMHC inhibitor with the BET inhibitor JQ1 eliminates inv(16) leukemia in human cells and a mouse model. Enhancer-interaction analysis indicated that the three enhancers are physically connected with the MYC promoter, and genome-editing analysis demonstrated that they are functionally implicated in deregulation of MYC expression.

As our cells divide, daughter cells become morphologically and functionally different from their grandmothers, mothers, sisters, and aunts. This process of specialization forms the basis of our development into complex multicellular organisms. A cell’s functional identity and fate are thought to be controlled by the RNAs it expresses, and cellular identity and fate can be altered by changing its RNA compilation, a process called reprogramming. If a cell becomes aberrantly programmed during development, an entire linage can be disrupted with devastating consequences. Thus, an important objective in biology is to completely understand cell-type lineages and the transcriptional states underlying cell fates so we can recognize and correct lineage problems when they happen and artificially reprogram cell fates when desired. But the task of mapping every cell lineage in a multicellular organism has been piecemeal and challenging. In a collection of recent papers, researchers now report some exciting progress using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to efficiently determine the complete transcriptomes of tens of thousands of individual cells from either flatworms, frogs, or fish at different time points (Briggs et al., 2018; Farrell et al., 2018; Fincher et al., 2018; Plass et al., 2018; Wagner et al., 2018).

The ONM is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the main site of phospholipid synthesis. In contrast to the ER and ONM, evidence for a metabolic activity of the INM has been lacking. Here, we show that the INM is an adaptable membrane territory capable of lipid metabolism. S. cerevisiae cells target enzymes to the INM that can promote lipid storage. Lipid storage involves the synthesis of nuclear lipid droplets from the INM and is characterized by lipid exchange through Seipin-dependent membrane bridges. We identify the genetic circuit for nuclear lipid droplet synthesis and a role of these organelles in regulating this circuit by sequestration of a transcription factor. Our findings suggest a link between INM metabolism and genome regulation and have potential relevance for human lipodystrophy.",True,Cell,False

Here, we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in various human cancers.

The LINE1 retrotransposon is the most abundant class and is thought to be deleterious for cells, yet it is paradoxically highly expressed during early development. Here, we report that LINE1 plays essential roles in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and pre-implantation embryos. In ESCs, LINE1 acts as a nuclear RNA scaffold that recruits Nucleolin and Kap1/Trim28 to repress Dux, the master activator of a transcriptional program specific to the 2-cell embryo. In parallel, LINE1 RNA mediates binding of Nucleolin and Kap1 to rDNA, promoting rRNA synthesis and ESC self-renewal. In embryos, LINE1 RNA is required for Dux silencing, synthesis of rRNA, and exit from the 2-cell stage.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) predisposes humans to invasive infections that are difficult to eradicate. We designed a closed-loop gene network programming mammalian cells to autonomously detect and eliminate bacterial infections. The genetic circuit contains human Toll-like receptors as the bacterial sensor and a synthetic promoter driving reversible and adjustable expression of lysostaphin, a bacteriolytic enzyme highly lethal to S. aureus. Immunomimetic designer cells harboring this genetic circuit exhibited fast and robust sense-and-destroy kinetics against live staphylococci. When tested in a foreign-body infection model in mice, microencapsulated cell implants prevented planktonic MRSA infection and reduced MRSA biofilm formation by 91%. Notably, this system achieved a 100% cure rate of acute MRSA infections, whereas conventional vancomycin treatment failed. These results suggest that immunomimetic designer cells could offer a therapeutic approach for early detection, prevention, and cure of pathogenic infections in the post-antibiotic era.

We developed genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein that self-assemble into bright, stable particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration, without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo.

The most common resistance mechanism is amplification of this locus presumably targeting the AR gene. Here, we identify and characterize a somatically acquired AR enhancer located 650 kb centromeric to the AR. Systematic perturbation of this enhancer using genome editing decreased proliferation by suppressing AR levels. Insertion of an additional copy of this region sufficed to increase proliferation under low androgen conditions and to decrease sensitivity to enzalutamide. Epigenetic data generated in localized prostate tumors and benign specimens support the notion that this region is a developmental enhancer. Collectively, these observations underscore the importance of epigenomic profiling in primary specimens and the value of deploying genome editing to functionally characterize noncoding elements.

Elevated mitophagy in IECs causes iron(II)-accumulation in epithelial lysosomes, in turn, triggering lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Subsequent release of proteases into the cytoplasm augments MHC class I presentation and activation of CD8+ T cells via cross-dressing of dendritic cells. Thus, our findings highlight a so-far-unrecognized link between mitochondrial function, lysosomal integrity, and MHC class I presentation in IECs and suggest that therapies triggering mitophagy or inducing LMP in IECs may prove successful in shifting the balance toward anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer.",True,Cell,False

Whole bone marrow transplantation results in selective repopulation of Lrrc33-/- brains with WT microglia and halts disease progression. The phenotypes of WT and Lrrc33-/- microglia in the same brain suggest that there is little spreading of TGF-β activated from one microglial cell to neighboring microglia.

While many of these target molecules that are expressed by immune cells, recent advances in immunometabolism are now opening new classes of modulators that derive from endogenous metabolites. It is becoming clear that the immune system is involved in many diseases, including conditions that were not traditionally considered infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In that context, immunomodulation is now a critical part of the pharmaceutic arsenal, either for the potentiation of immune responses, with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 as obvious examples, or to limit them, with anti-tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) leading drug sales for the last few years. By and large, research in this area has been focused on blocking immune cytokines and receptors either through antibodies or kinase inhibitors. Now, with two recent studies reporting the use of modified metabolites to suppress immune responses (Kornberg et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018), immunometabolism is opening a new front in the quest to modulate immune function. Indeed, the current approaches have shown extraordinary success, but they have also sometimes been limited by the redundancy of immune activators and inhibitors. For example, immune exhaustion in cancer is mediated by a large variety of soluble and cell-surface molecules, and despite the success of anti-PD-1 as a single agent, many other receptors might need to be blocked simultaneously to improve therapeutic efficiency further and overcome resistance (Sharma et al., 2017). In addition to immune mediators, the function of immune cells is also modulated by all core pathways for cellular function, and metabolism has emerged as a critical hub in their activation.

Here, we demonstrate a multiplexed single-molecule in situ method, intron seqFISH, that allows imaging of 10,421 genes at their nascent transcription active sites in single cells, followed by mRNA and lncRNA seqFISH and immunofluorescence. This nascent transcriptome-profiling method can identify different cell types and states with mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. The nascent sites of RNA synthesis tend to be localized on the surfaces of chromosome territories, and their organization in individual cells is highly variable. Surprisingly, the global nascent transcription oscillated asynchronously in individual cells with a period of 2 hr in mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as in fibroblasts.

The principles controlling the activation and organization of the actin cytoskeleton during mammalian CME are, however, not fully understood. Here, we show that the protein FCHSD2 is a major activator of actin polymerization during CME. FCHSD2 deletion leads to decreased ligand uptake caused by slowed pit maturation. FCHSD2 is recruited to endocytic pits by the scaffold protein intersectin via an unusual SH3-SH3 interaction. Here, its flat F-BAR domain binds to the planar region of the plasma membrane surrounding the developing pit forming an annulus. When bound to the membrane, FCHSD2 activates actin polymerization by a mechanism that combines oligomerization and recruitment of N-WASP to PI(4,5)P2, thus promoting pit maturation. Our data therefore describe a molecular mechanism for linking spatiotemporally the plasma membrane to a force-generating actin platform guiding endocytic vesicle maturation.",True,Cell,False

Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs-a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs-using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network. The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA. Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs. By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity. Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671.

Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However, this approach can fail to detect known structures, such as interactions with nuclear bodies, because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies.

Bacterial NusG regulates RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation complexes (ECs) across most genes, enhancing elongation by suppressing RNAP backtracking and coordinating ρ-dependent termination and translation. The NusG paralog RfaH engages the EC only at operon polarity suppressor (ops) sites and suppresses both backtrack and hairpin-stabilized pausing. We used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of ECs at ops with NusG or RfaH. Both factors chaperone base-pairing of the upstream duplex DNA to suppress backtracking, explaining stimulation of elongation genome-wide. The RfaH-opsEC structure reveals how RfaH confers operon specificity through specific recognition of an ops hairpin in the single-stranded nontemplate DNA and tighter binding to the EC to exclude NusG.

A20 deficiency in ILC2s spontaneously triggers the circuit and, unexpectedly, promotes adaptive small-intestinal lengthening and remodeling. Circuit activation occurs upon weaning and is enabled by dietary polysaccharides that render mice permissive for Tritrichomonas colonization, resulting in luminal accumulation of acetate and succinate, metabolites of the protist hydrogenosome. Tuft cells express GPR91, the succinate receptor, and dietary succinate, but not acetate, activates ILC2s via a tuft-, TRPM5-, and IL-25-dependent pathway.

Unexpectedly, we uncover a profound disruption of the circadian clock and diurnal transcriptome when hypoxic cells are permitted to acidify to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Buffering against acidification or inhibiting lactic acid production fully rescues circadian oscillation. Acidification of several human and murine cell lines, as well as primary murine T cells, suppresses mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, a key regulator of translation in response to metabolic status. We find that acid drives peripheral redistribution of normally perinuclear lysosomes away from perinuclear RHEB, thereby inhibiting the activity of lysosome-bound mTOR. Restoring mTORC1 signaling and the translation it governs rescues clock oscillation.

Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons.

Specifically, at the ∼6 μm scale, clusters of boutons from different axons often showed similar preferences for either one or multiple features, including axis and direction of motion, spatial frequency, and changes in luminance. Conversely, individual axons could ""de-multiplex"" information channels by participating in multiple, functionally distinct bouton clusters.

For clinical oncologists the obstinate cancer cells that withstand treatment and are most often undetectable by microscope, are known as ‘‘minimal residual disease.’’ For instance, individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) typically have a massive burden of cancerous cells at the start of treatment, but after high-dose induction chemotherapy this is drastically reduced and many patients go into remission. Yet, for many of these the disease will eventually come back. How can relapse be predicted during remission? In a recent study, Jongen-Lavrencic et al. (2018) use next-generation sequencing of blood or bone marrow samples from individuals treated and in remission for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to understand the mutation patterns of minimal residual disease and show which profiles have a higher association with disease recurrence. The authors conduct targeted sequencing to assess ‘‘molecular minimal residual disease’’ in 430 AML patients. When comparing the resulting molecular profiles with frequency of relapse and relapse-free survival, they show that individuals with persisting mutations in one or more of a trio of genes DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (so-called DTA mutations) do not have a high risk of recurrence, whereas those with persisting non-DTA mutations were at heightened risk over the 4-year period of follow up. What ties these three genes together is that they are frequently impacted with mutations that accrue during normal aging and so are not only associated with malignant disease.

Human telomerase employs a non-coding RNA (hTR) with a bipartite arrangement of domains-a template-containing core and a distal three-way junction (CR4/5) that stimulates catalysis through unknown means. Here, we show that telomerase activity unexpectedly depends upon the holoenzyme protein TCAB1, which in turn controls conformation of CR4/5. Cells lacking TCAB1 exhibit a marked reduction in telomerase catalysis without affecting enzyme assembly. Instead, TCAB1 inactivation causes unfolding of CR4/5 helices that are required for catalysis and for association with the telomerase reverse-transcriptase (TERT). CR4/5 mutations derived from patients with telomere biology disorders provoke defects in catalysis and TERT binding similar to TCAB1 inactivation. These findings reveal a conformational ""activity switch"" in human telomerase RNA controlling catalysis and TERT engagement. The identification of two discrete catalytic states for telomerase suggests an intramolecular means for controlling telomerase in cancers and progenitor cells.",True,Cell,False

To test whether astrocytic activity is also sufficient to generate synaptic potentiation and enhance memory, we expressed the Gq-coupled receptor hM3Dq in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their activation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic activation is not only necessary for synaptic plasticity, but also sufficient to induce NMDA-dependent de novo long-term potentiation in the hippocampus that persisted after astrocytic activation ceased. In vivo, astrocytic activation enhanced memory allocation; i.e., it increased neuronal activity in a task-specific way only when coupled with learning, but not in home-caged mice. Furthermore, astrocytic activation using either a chemogenetic or an optogenetic tool during acquisition resulted in memory recall enhancement on the following day. Conversely, directly increasing neuronal activity resulted in dramatic memory impairment.

CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites and a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Time-resolved acetylome analyses identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (<30 min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation.

Enrichment of, and gnotobiotic co-colonization with, KD-associated Akkermansia and Parabacteroides restores seizure protection. Moreover, transplantation of the KD gut microbiota and treatment with Akkermansia and Parabacteroides each confer seizure protection to mice fed a control diet. Alterations in colonic lumenal, serum, and hippocampal metabolomic profiles correlate with seizure protection, including reductions in systemic gamma-glutamylated amino acids and elevated hippocampal GABA/glutamate levels.

Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors.

Using a strategy combining global protein stability (GPS) profiling with a synthetic human peptidome, we identify thousands of peptides containing degron activity. Employing CRISPR screening, we establish that the stability of many proteins is regulated through degrons located at their C terminus. We characterize eight Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex adaptors that regulate C-terminal degrons, including six CRL2 and two CRL4 complexes, and computationally implicate multiple non-CRLs in end recognition. Proteome analysis revealed that the C termini of eukaryotic proteins are depleted for C-terminal degrons, suggesting an E3-ligase-dependent modulation of proteome composition.

Micropipette aspiration and single-cell tracking unravel unique features of an atypical fluidized phase, with single-cell diffusion exceeding that of isolated cells. A quantitative description of the bacterial pair interactions combined with active matter physics-based modeling show that this behavior relies on type IV pili active dynamics that mediate alternating phases of bacteria fast mutual approach, contact, and release.

PNPT1 knockdown inhibits apoptotic RNA decay and reduces apoptosis, while ectopic expression of PNPT1, but not an RNase-deficient mutant, increases RNA decay and cell death.

This UV-triggered GLU synthesis promoted its packaging into synaptic vesicles and its release at glutamatergic terminals in the motor cortex and hippocampus.

In this exciting age of modern neuroscience, great progress is being made in understanding the neurobiology of thought from cellular, molecular, developmental, evolutionary, and systems neuroscience perspectives. The brain is often considered the most complex organ. Within the brain, the cerebral cortex is the region responsible for higher thought processes. The building of the cerebral cortex is an intricate process requiring a beautifully orchestrated program where billions of neurons are generated and assembled into complex circuits at the right time and place and with the right functional specializations. While much has been learned aboutmammalian neurogenesis and cortex development from rodent models, there are fundamental differences between mice and humans that have made understanding uniquely human cognitive abilities challenging. The human cerebral cortex is characterized by two unique features: its unusual size relative not only to the rest of the brain, but also to overall body size, as well as its level of gyrification, or cortical folding, which is thought to increase surface area. Both of these aspects are thought to be important for higher human cognitive abilities.

Feedback is established through a serial cascade of post-transcriptional splicing, whereby proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor unspliced mRNAs.

We find that S. pyogenes, the leading cause of necrotizing fasciitis, secretes streptolysin S (SLS) to directly activate nociceptor neurons and produce pain during infection. Nociceptors, in turn, release the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) into infected tissues, which inhibits the recruitment of neutrophils and opsonophagocytic killing of S. pyogenes.

DSBs resected at both ends are converted into inter-homolog repair intermediates harboring two populations of BLM helicase and RPA, flanking a single population of MutSγ. These intermediates accumulate until late pachytene, when repair proteins disappear from non-CO sites and CO-designated sites become enveloped by SC-central region proteins, acquire a second MutSγ population, and lose RPA.

Here, we identify the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a key modulator of inflammation and β cell survival. Alternative recognition of an acetylated lysine in VDR by bromodomain proteins BRD7 and BRD9 directs association to PBAF and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes, respectively. Mechanistically, ligand promotes VDR association with PBAF to effect genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility and enhancer landscape, resulting in an anti-inflammatory response. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of BRD9 promotes PBAF-VDR association to restore β cell function and ameliorate hyperglycemia in murine T2D models. These studies reveal an unrecognized VDR-dependent transcriptional program underpinning β cell survival and identifies the VDR:PBAF/BAF association as a potential therapeutic target for T2D.",True,Cell,False

In most cells where cohesin loads without conferring cohesion, it does so by entrapment of individual DNAs. However, cohesin with a hinge domain whose positively charged lumen is neutralized loads and moves along chromatin despite failing to entrap DNAs. Thus, cohesin engages chromatin in non-topological, as well as topological, manners. Since hinge mutations, but not Smc-kleisin fusions, abolish entrapment, DNAs may enter cohesin rings through hinge opening. Mutation of three highly conserved lysine residues inside the Smc1 moiety of Smc1/3 hinges abolishes all loading without affecting cohesin’s recruitment to CEN loading sites or its ability to hydrolyze ATP. We suggest that loading and translocation are mediated by conformational changes in cohesin’s hinge driven by cycles of ATP hydrolysis.",True,Cell,False

To identify novel treatment options for such patients, we searched for acquired vulnerabilities of MAPK inhibitor-resistant melanomas. We find that resistance to BRAF+MEK inhibitors is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat suppresses SLC7A11, leading to a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS in drug-resistant cells. This causes selective apoptotic death of only the drug-resistant tumor cells. Consistently, treatment of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma with vorinostat in mice results in dramatic tumor regression. In a study in patients with advanced BRAF+MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma, we find that vorinostat can selectively ablate drug-resistant tumor cells, providing clinical proof of concept for the novel therapy identified here.",True,Cell,False

Here, we pioneer a protein tag, LlamaTag, which circumvents this maturation limit by binding mature fluorescent proteins, making it possible to visualize transcription factor concentration dynamics in live embryos. Implementing this approach in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we discovered stochastic bursts in the concentration of transcription factors that are correlated with bursts in transcription. We further used LlamaTags to show that the concentration of protein in a given nucleus heavily depends on transcription of that gene in neighboring nuclei; we speculate that this inter-nuclear signaling is an important mechanism for coordinating gene expression to delineate straight and sharp boundaries of gene expression.

MBH contains a membrane-anchored hydrogenase module that is highly similar structurally to the quinone-binding Q-module of complex I while its membrane-embedded ion-translocation module can be divided into a H+- and a Na+-translocating unit. The H+-translocating unit is rotated 180° in-membrane with respect to its counterpart in complex I, leading to distinctive architectures for the two respiratory systems despite their largely conserved proton-pumping mechanisms. The Na+-translocating unit, absent in complex I, resembles that found in the Mrp H+/Na+ antiporter and enables hydrogen gas evolution by MBH to establish a Na+ gradient for ATP synthesis near 100°C.

We now report the crystal structures of SidE alone and in complex with ubiquitin, NAD, and ADP-ribose, thereby capturing different conformations of SidE before and after ubiquitin and ligand binding. The structures of ubiquitin bound to both mART and PDE domains reveal several unique features of the two reaction steps catalyzed by SidE.

This ability has been linked to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). To investigate how information is encoded and transmitted through this circuit, we performed electrophysiological recordings in mice observing a demonstrator mouse undergo associative fear conditioning and found that BLA-projecting ACC (ACC→BLA) neurons preferentially encode socially derived aversive cue information. Inhibition of ACC→BLA alters real-time amygdala representation of the aversive cue during observational conditioning. Selective inhibition of the ACC→BLA projection impaired acquisition, but not expression, of observational fear conditioning.

The promoters of the PVT1 and the MYC oncogenes, located 55 kb apart on chromosome 8q24, compete for engagement with four intragenic enhancers in the PVT1 locus, thereby allowing the PVT1 promoter to regulate pause release of MYC transcription. PVT1 undergoes developmentally regulated monoallelic expression, and the PVT1 promoter inhibits MYC expression only from the same chromosome via promoter competition.

The second cell type undergoes transdifferentiation into epidermal cells, forming protective cuticle, demonstrating de novo specification of epidermal cells, previously thought to be restricted to embryogenesis.

This difficulty rests on the overarching principle that the 3D structure of a protein determines its functionality by specifying with which other proteins and molecules it can interact. Conventional structural biology approaches, likeX-raycrystallography, haveenabledus tofigure out the shapes and interactionsofmany rigidly foldedproteins or their constituent domains. However, sometimes invisible to crystallographers are so-called low-complexity and intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which often do not form stable and predictable 3D structures in physiological conditions or in the absence of their binding partners. Despite this conformational heterogeneity and flexibility, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and unstructured stretches of amino acids participate in many essential processes and provide new paradigms for protein-protein interactions. IDPs are generally thought to either conditionally establish secondary structure elements upon binding to their target or remain unfolded and participate in low-affinity, high-avidity dynamic interactions with other proteins. The former case can be exemplified by the formation of an a-helical region in the disordered domain of the transcription factor CREB upon binding to its transcriptional coactivator, CBP/p300 (Sugase et al., 2007). Transient and multivalent interactions are perhaps best illustrated by the core selectivity filter of nuclear pore complexes, where proteins with low-complexity sequence regions dynamically bind and unbind at many sites on the surface of nuclear import or export receptors, which is thought to drive fast directional transport. Indeed, intrinsically disordered regions of proteins mediate many of the multivalent interactions that form the basis of phase-separated liquid droplets, which are now widely appreciated in myriad cellular processes like RNA processing (Schmidt and Gorlich, 2016).

The deletion of one such TR caused quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to reacquire epithelial features, partially recapitulating the effects of ZEB1 gene deletion.

Using a proteome-wide implementation of the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to study specific cell-cycle phases, we uncover changes of interaction states for more than 750 proteins during the cell cycle. Notably, many protein complexes are modulated in specific cell-cycle phases, reflecting their roles in processes such as DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, transcription, translation, and disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, only small differences in the interaction states were seen between the G1 and the G2 phase, suggesting similar hardwiring of biochemical processes in these two phases. The present work reveals novel molecular details of the cell cycle and establishes proteome-wide CETSA as a new strategy to study modulation of protein-interaction states in intact cells.",True,Cell,False

In this work, we solved the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hDicer in complex with its cofactor protein TRBP and revealed the precise spatial arrangement of hDicer's multiple domains. We further solved structures of the hDicer-TRBP complex bound with pre-let-7 RNA in two distinct conformations. In combination with biochemical analysis, these structures reveal a property of the hDicer-TRBP complex to promote the stability of pre-miRNA's stem duplex in a pre-dicing state.

 Summary
 
 Bats harbor many viruses asymptomatically, including several notorious for causing extreme virulence in humans. To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.

We sought to identify, delineate, and manipulate this putatively parallel architecture in the dorsal subiculum, the primary output subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Population and single-cell RNA-seq revealed that the subiculum can be divided into two spatially adjacent subregions associated with prominent differences in pyramidal cell gene expression. Pyramidal cells occupying these two regions differed in their long-range inputs, local wiring, projection targets, and electrophysiological properties.

Following on concerns raised by a reader, we contacted the corresponding author for original data, which she supplied. We then carried out a preliminary assessment of the figures and detected irregularities. We contacted the Office of Research Integrity at the author’s institution, Saint Louis University, as well. An investigation there concluded that data in three figures had been inappropriately manipulated and that the manipulations did not affect conclusions drawn from the data. The investigation found that Figures 1C, 2B, and 4D contain evidence of stamping, placing a cut-out section from one part of a processed image over another part of the same image. In Figure 1C, because the stamping covers bands for two regulatory complex components (Rpn12 and Rpn10) in a control condition, support is enhanced for the conclusion that complex dissociation occurs under conditions that support ATP hydrolysis. The stamping in the other panels did not obscure data. In addition to the three panels where stamping occurred, data were also falsified in Figure 2A, where one of the lanes in the western blots was duplicated. The figure presents a fractionation analysis showing the pattern of free subunits and subcomplexes derived from dissociating 19S complexes. Lane 6 was not present in the original blots for Rpn3, Rpn12, Rpn10, and Rpt1 and was created in the final figure by duplicating lane 7.

Yet the molecules responsible for sensing flow (shear stress) within endothelial cells remain largely unknown. We designed a 384-well screening system that applies shear stress on cultured cells. We identified a mechanosensitive cell line that exhibits shear stress-activated calcium transients, screened a focused RNAi library, and identified GPR68 as necessary and sufficient for shear stress responses. GPR68 is expressed in endothelial cells of small-diameter (resistance) arteries.

An immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain seals the bottom of the barrel while a β propeller is attached in a perpendicular orientation.

Here, we report that cooperative cation-π interactions between tyrosines in the LC domain and arginines in structured C-terminal domains also contribute to phase separation. These interactions are modulated by post-translational arginine methylation, wherein arginine hypomethylation strongly promotes phase separation and gelation. Indeed, significant hypomethylation, which occurs in FUS-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), induces FUS condensation into stable intermolecular β-sheet-rich hydrogels that disrupt RNP granule function and impair new protein synthesis in neuron terminals. We show that transportin acts as a physiological molecular chaperone of FUS in neuron terminals, reducing phase separation and gelation of methylated and hypomethylated FUS and rescuing protein synthesis. These results demonstrate how FUS condensation is physiologically regulated and how perturbations in these mechanisms can lead to disease.",True,Cell,False

A key step that is disrupted in these patients is nuclear import of FUS mediated by the import receptor Transportin/Karyopherin-β2. In ALS-FUS patients, this is caused by mutations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of FUS that weaken Transportin binding. In FTD-FUS patients, Transportin is aggregated, and post-translational arginine methylation, which regulates the FUS-Transportin interaction, is lost. Here, we show that Transportin and arginine methylation have a crucial function beyond nuclear import-namely to suppress RGG/RG-driven phase separation and stress granule association of FUS. ALS-associated FUS-NLS mutations weaken the chaperone activity of Transportin and loss of FUS arginine methylation, as seen in FTD-FUS, promote phase separation, and stress granule partitioning of FUS.

The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-β2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-β2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-β2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-β2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS.

Several nuclear RBPs with PrLDs, including TDP-43, FUS, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2, mislocalize to cytoplasmic inclusions in neurodegenerative disorders, and mutations in their PrLDs can accelerate fibrillization and cause disease. Here, we establish that nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) specifically chaperone and potently disaggregate wild-type and disease-linked RBPs bearing a NLS. Karyopherin-β2 (also called Transportin-1) engages PY-NLSs to inhibit and reverse FUS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2 fibrillization, whereas Importin-α plus Karyopherin-β1 prevent and reverse TDP-43 fibrillization. Remarkably, Karyopherin-β2 dissolves phase-separated liquids and aberrant fibrillar hydrogels formed by FUS and hnRNPA1. In vivo, Karyopherin-β2 prevents RBPs with PY-NLSs accumulating in stress granules, restores nuclear RBP localization and function, and rescues degeneration caused by disease-linked FUS and hnRNPA2.

Machine-learning platforms for clinical purposes are also making the headlines. Early last year, Stanford-based scientists harnessed aGoogle algorithm to classify skin cancers as accurately as board-certified dermatologists (Esteva et al., 2017). This algorithm distinguishes harmless from potentially fatal moles at an early stage, which is critical, given that melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers and its global incidence is on the rise. 2018 itself has already seen significant AI advances. These bring many unprecedented opportunities—and daunting challenges. ‘‘The eyes are a window to the heart’’—we’ve all heard it before.

Here, we show that a computational machine-learning approach, which we call ""in silico labeling"" (ISL), reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels, such as those for nuclei, cell type (e.g., neural), and cell state (e.g., cell death). Because prediction happens in silico, the method is consistent, is not limited by spectral overlap, and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire.",True,Cell,False

Arabidopsis NPR1 and NPR3/NPR4 were previously shown to bind SA and all three proteins were proposed as SA receptors. NPR1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator, whereas NPR3/NPR4 were suggested to function as E3 ligases that promote NPR1 degradation. Here we report that NPR3/NPR4 function as transcriptional co-repressors and SA inhibits their activities to promote the expression of downstream immune regulators. npr4-4D, a gain-of-function npr4 allele that renders NPR4 unable to bind SA, constitutively represses SA-induced immune responses. In contrast, the equivalent mutation in NPR1 abolishes its ability to bind SA and promote SA-induced defense gene expression. Further analysis revealed that NPR3/NPR4 and NPR1 function independently to regulate SA-induced immune responses. Our study indicates that both NPR1 and NPR3/NPR4 are bona fide SA receptors, but play opposite roles in transcriptional regulation of SA-induced defense gene expression.",True,Cell,False

Metastatic competence was afforded by chromosome complexity, and we identify 9p loss as a highly selected event driving metastasis and ccRCC-related mortality (p = 0.0014). Distinct patterns of metastatic dissemination were observed, including rapid progression to multiple tissue sites seeded by primary tumors of monoclonal structure. By contrast, we observed attenuated progression in cases characterized by high primary tumor heterogeneity, with metastatic competence acquired gradually and initial progression to solitary metastasis.

We observe up to 30 driver events per tumor and show that subclonal diversification is associated with known prognostic parameters. By resolving the patterns of driver event ordering, co-occurrence, and mutual exclusivity at clone level, we show the deterministic nature of clonal evolution. ccRCC can be grouped into seven evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumors characterized by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number drivers and rapid metastases to highly branched tumors with >10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution associated with attenuated progression.

By combining proximity labeling with quantitative mass spectrometry, we generated high-resolution interaction neighborhood maps of the endogenously expressed DNA repair factors 53BP1, BRCA1, and MDC1. Our spatially resolved interaction maps reveal rich network intricacies, identify shared and bait-specific interaction modules, and implicate previously concealed regulators in this process. We identified a novel vertebrate-specific protein complex, shieldin, comprising REV7 plus three previously uncharacterized proteins, RINN1 (CTC-534A2.2), RINN2 (FAM35A), and RINN3 (C20ORF196). Recruitment of shieldin to DSBs, via the ATM-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1-RIF1 axis, promotes NHEJ-dependent repair of intrachromosomal breaks, immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR), and fusion of unprotected telomeres. Shieldin functions as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection and in sensitizing BRCA1-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors.

We validate this gene expression signature in an independent anti-CTLA-4-treated cohort and show its specificity to the CTLA-4 pathway with two independent anti-PD-1-treated cohorts. Autophagy, a process critical for optimal anti-cancer immunity, has previously been shown to be suppressed by the MAGE-TRIM28 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. We now show that the expression of the key autophagosome component LC3B and other activators of autophagy are negatively associated with MAGE-A protein levels in human melanomas, including samples from patients with resistance to CTLA-4 blockade.

We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5′ UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor’s most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred.

Furthermore, nucleocytoplasmic transport disruption has also been implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases with protein aggregation, suggesting a shared mechanism by which protein stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport. Here, we show that cellular stress disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport by localizing critical nucleocytoplasmic transport factors into stress granules, RNA/protein complexes that play a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis. Importantly, inhibiting stress granule assembly, such as by knocking down Ataxin-2, suppresses nucleocytoplasmic transport defects as well as neurodegeneration in C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD.

Here, we identify a cluster of eight genes on Ab10, called the Kinesin driver (Kindr) complex, that are required for both neocentromere motility and preferential transmission. Two meiotic drive mutants that lack neocentromere activity proved to be kindr epimutants with increased DNA methylation across the entire gene cluster. RNAi of Kindr induced a third epimutant and corresponding loss of meiotic drive. Kinesin gliding assays and immunolocalization revealed that KINDR is a functional minus-end-directed kinesin that localizes specifically to knobs containing 180 bp repeats. Sequence comparisons suggest that Kindr diverged from a Kinesin-14A ancestor ∼12 mya and has driven the accumulation of > 500 Mb of knob repeats and affected the segregation of thousands of genes linked to knobs on all 10 chromosomes.",True,Cell,False

The current model explaining the gain-of-function activity of the R201 mutations is through the loss of GTPase activity and resulting inability to switch off to the GDP state. Here, we find that the R201C mutation can bypass the need for GTP binding by directly activating GDP-bound Gαs through stabilization of an intramolecular hydrogen bond network. Having found that a gain-of-function mutation can convert GDP into an activator, we postulated that a reciprocal mutation might disrupt the normal role of GTP. Indeed, we found R228C, a loss-of-function mutation in Gαs that causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-Ia), compromised the adenylyl cyclase-activating activity of Gαs bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog.
