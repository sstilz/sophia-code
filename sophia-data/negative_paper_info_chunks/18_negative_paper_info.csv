As cells naturally experience 3D environments in vivo, traction microscopy has been adapted to 3D gels; cells can be tracked over time in 3D. Microscopy images acquired in several fields-of-view e.g. in a time series, may experience drift, which can produce artefactual results that may appear valid and lead to flawed analysis. Hence, we have developed an algorithm for 2D/3D de-drifting of cell-images on 3D gels with fiducial markers (beads) as anchor points. Both lateral and vertical de-drifting are performed using gel-internalized beads, as those used in traction microscopy experiments; this eliminates need for immobilizing beads under the gel for de-drifting, and reduces experiment time. We introduce simulations of initially grid-ordered dots (beads) that are radially displaced to experimentally observed distances, while also applying additive drift. This facilitates testing and demonstration of the de-drifting procedures in 2D/3D. We demonstrate the importance of applying de-drifting using both computer-simulated drifts and experimentally observed drifts in confocal microscopy images. We show that our de-drifting algorithm can remove lateral and/or vertical drift revealing even small, underlying signals. The 2D/3D de-drifting algorithm, crucial for accurate identification of cell-induced marker-displacement, as well as the bead simulations, will shorten traction microscopy experiments and facilitate optimization of the experimental protocols.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To understand pathological toe walking, previous studies have analyzed non-habitual toe walking. These studies found sagittal plane deviations between heel-toe and toe walking at the hip, knee, and ankle. Further investigation is merited as toe walking may involve altered biomechanics at more distal joints, such as the midtarsal joint. The purpose of this study was to examine biomechanical differences between rearfoot strike walking (RFSW) and non-rearfoot strike walking (NRFSW) in the midfoot and ankle. We hypothesized that during NRFSW, midtarsal kinematics would diverge from those during RFSW in all three cardinal planes and ankle kinematics would display increased supination. Twenty-four healthy females walked overground with both walking patterns. Motion capture, electromyography (EMG), and force plate data were collected. A validated multi-segment foot model was used with mean difference waveform analyses to compare walking conditions during stance. Significantly different kinematics were found in all three planes for the midtarsal and ankle joint during NRFSW. The NRFSW midtarsal joint exhibited increased plantarflexion, eversion, and adduction with the largest differences occurring at initial contact and in the sagittal plane. The NRFSW ankle exhibited increased supination at initial contact and during early stance. These findings indicate that toe walking alters both distal and proximal foot joint kinematics in multiple planes. This may further the understanding of altered biomechanics during toe walking while providing a basis for future analyses of pathological gait.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ten healthy subjects walked at their preferred walking speed for 15 min under three different treadmill control modes. Stride time, stride length, and stride speed were measured using an inertial measurement unit. The mean, coefficient of variance, Poincaré descriptors, and gait dynamics were calculated for each parameter. The mean values of stride length and stride speed were significantly increased when the treadmill had a quick response speed to the user's walking behavior. The long-term variability of stride length and stride speed was significantly affected by the treadmill control algorithms. A reduced strength of long-range correlations of stride time and stride speed was found when walking on the SP treadmill with suppressed treadmill accelerations and small velocity variations. We suggest that the suppression of treadmill acceleration provides more adaptability and less constraint to the user during SP treadmill walking. Although further research is required, the present work provides a basis for interpreting the influence of treadmill control algorithms on human gait.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Their mechanical behaviour is however still not well understood. Herein, we complete the existing mechanical database of these soft tissues, by characterising, for the first time, the cyclic and finite strains behaviour of the lamina propria and vocalis layers under these loading modes. To minimise the inter or intra-individual variability, particular attention was paid to subject each tissue sample successively to the three loadings. A non-linear mechanical behaviour is observed for all loading modes: a J-shape strain stiffening in longitudinal tension and transverse compression, albeit far less pronounced in shear, stress accommodation and stress hysteresis whatever the loading mode. In addition, recorded stress levels during longitudinal tension are much higher for the lamina propria than for the vocalis. Conversely, the responses of the lamina propria and the vocalis in transverse compression as well as transverse and longitudinal shears are of the same orders of magnitude. We also highlight the strain rate sensitivity of the tissues, as well as their anisotropic properties.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Circumduction versus flexion/abduction range of motion.,"The biomechanical function of the wrist is widely assessed by measuring the range of motion (RoM) in two separate orthogonal planes: flexion-extension (FE) and radioulnar deviation (RUD). However, the two motions are coupled. The aim of this study is to compare wrist circumduction with FE and RUD RoM in terms of representativeness of the kinematic requirements for performing activities of daily living (ADL). To this end, the wrist motion of healthy participants was measured while performing maximum RoM in FE and in RUD, circumduction, and thirty-two representative ADL. Active and functional RoM (ARoM and FRoM) were computed in each plane, the evolving circumduction curves were adjusted to ellipses, and intensity maps representing the frequency of the coupling angles in ADL were plotted, both per ADL and globally for both hands. Ellipses representing different percentages of coupling angles in ADL were also plotted. Wrist circumduction fits the coupling angles measured in ADL better than ARoM or FRoM. As a novelty, quantitative data for both circumduction and the coupling angles required in ADL are provided, shedding light on the real biomechanical function requirements of the wrist. Results might be used to quantify mobility reduction and its impact on the performance of ADL, globally and per ADL, to enhance rehabilitation strategies, as well as in clinical decision-making, robotics, and prostheses.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, scarce is the current knowledge of the effect of high-energy motor tasks, such as running, on the repeatability of these measurements. This study aimed at assessing and comparing the inter-trial, inter-session, and inter-examiner repeatability of skin-markers based foot kinematic measures in walking and running in healthy adults. The repeatability of 24 kinematic measures from an established multi-segment foot model were assessed in two volunteers during multiple barefoot walking and running trials by four examiners in three sessions. Statistical Parametric Mapping (1D-SPM) analysis was performed to assess the degree of shape-similarity between patterns of kinematic measurements. The average inter-trial variability across measurements (deg) was 1.0 ± 0.3 and 0.8 ± 0.3, the inter-session was 3.9 ± 1.4 and 4.4 ± 1.5, and the inter-examiner was 5.4 ± 2.3 and 5.7 ± 2.2, respectively in walking and running. Inter-session variability was generally similar between the two motor tasks, but significantly larger in running for two kinematic measures (p < 0.01). Inter-examiner variability was generally larger than inter-trial and inter-session variability. While no significant differences in frame-by-frame offset variability was detected in foot kinematics between walking and running, 1D-SPM revealed that the shape of kinematic measurements was significantly affected by the motor task, with running being less repeatable than walking. Although confirmation on a larger population and with different kinematic protocols should be sought, attention should be paid in the interpretation of skin-markers based kinematics in running across sessions or involving multiple examiners.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In situ compress-and-hold experiments were performed on the sciatic nerves of healthy and diabetic rats, and the blood flow within the vasa nervorum was observed using Doppler-optical coherence tomography. A new technique was developed to obtain the time-course of the cross sectional area and the morphology of the vasa nervorum from the tomographic images. A quasi-linear viscoelastic model was used to investigate the overall biomechanical properties of the nerves, and a two-dimensional three-layered finite element model was constructed to analyze the distribution of stress and the morphological changes during the compression-relaxation process. The results showed that the lumenal area of vasa nervorum was reduced in the compression stage, especially for the diabetic nerves. The reduction was greater than 70% when the reduction of the nerve diameter was only 10%. The quasi-linear viscoelastic model showed that normal nerves were more elastic but less viscous than the diabetic nerves. The finite element analyses demonstrated that perineurium could sustain more stress than other layers, while epineurium served as a cushion to protect vasa nervora. In addition, there were regions within epineurium with less stress, so that vasa nervora in these saddle regions were less deformed. The vasa nervorum in diabetic rats was more prone to compression and reduction of blood flow than that of the normal rats. The histological studies supported the simulation results.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We aimed to quantify the head kinematics associated with direct helmet contact and inertial head loading events in collegiate-level American football. A cohort of collegiate-level players were equipped with instrumented mouthguards synchronised with time-stamped multiple camera-view video footage of matches and practice. Video-verified contact events were identified as direct helmet contact or inertial head loading events and categorised as blocking, blocked, tackling, tackled or ground contact. Linear mixed-effects models were utilised to compare peak head kinematics between contact event categories. The timestamp-based cross-verification of the video analysis and instrumented mouthguard approach resulted in 200 and 328 direct helmet contact and inertial head loading cases, respectively. Median linear acceleration, angular acceleration and angular velocity for inertial head loading cases was greater than direct helmet contact events by 8% (p = 0.007), 55% (p < 0.001) and 4% (p = 0.007), respectively. Median head kinematics for all contact event categories appeared similar with no pairwise comparison resulting in statistical significance (p > 0.05). The study highlights the potential of combining qualitative video analysis with in-vivo head kinematics measurements. The findings suggest that a number of direct helmet contact events sustained in American football are of lower magnitude to what is sustained during regular play (i.e. from inertial head loading). Additionally, the findings illustrate the importance of including all contact events, including direct helmet contact and inertial head loading cases, when assessing head acceleration exposure and player load during a season of American football.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Many functions and dysfunctions attributed to ECM are thought to stem from its mechanical properties, yet there are few data describing the mechanics of intact ECM. Such measurements require isolating intact ECM from the muscle cells it surrounds. The objectives of this study were to quantify the efficiency of three techniques for this purpose: Triton, Triton with sodium dodecyl sulfate, and latrunculin B; and to determine their impact on properties of the remaining ECM. Efficiency was quantified by DNA content and evaluation of western blot intensities for myosin and actin. The properties of ECM were quantified by collagen content and uniaxial tensile testing. We found that latrunculin B was the most efficient method for removing skeletal muscle cells, reducing DNA content to less than 10% of that seen in control muscles, and substantially reducing the myosin and actin to 15% and 23%, respectively; these changes were larger than for the competing methods. Collagen content after decellularization was not significantly different from control muscles for all methods. Only the stiffness of the muscles decellularized with latrunculin B differed significantly from control, having a Young's modulus reduced by 47% compared to the other methods at matched stresses. Our results suggest that latrunculin B is the most efficient method for decellularizing skeletal muscle and that the remaining ECM accounts for approximately half of the stiffness in passive muscle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A comparison of models and spatial heterogeneity.,"Modelling intracranial aneurysm blood flow after flow diverter treatment has proven to be of great scientific and clinical interest. One of the reasons for not having CFD as an everyday clinical tool yet is the time required to set-up such simulations plus the required computational time. The speed-up of these simulations can have a considerable impact during treatment planning and device selection. Modelling flow diverters as a porous medium (PM) can considerably improve the computational time. Many models have been presented in literature, but quantitative comparisons between models are scarce. In this study, the untreated case, the explicit definition of the flow diverter wires as no-slip boundary condition and five different porous medium models were chosen for comparison, and evaluated on intracranial aneurysm of 14 patients with different shapes, sizes, and locations. CFD simulations were made using finite volume method on steady flow conditions. Velocities, kinetic energy, wall shear stress, and computational time were assessed for each model. Then, all models are compared against the no-slip boundary condition using non parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The model with least performance showed a mean K-S statistic of 0.31 and deviance of 0.2, while the model with best values always gave K-S statistics below 0.2. Kinetic energy between PM models varied between an over estimation of 218.3% and an under estimation of 73.06%. Also, speedups were between 4.75x and 5.3x (stdev: 0.38x and 0.15x) when using PM models. Flow diverters can be simulated with PM with a good agreement to standard CFD simulations were FD wires are represented with no-slip boundary condition in less than a quarter of the time. Best results were obtained on PM models based on geometrical properties, in particular, when using a heterogeneous medium based on equations for flat rhomboidal wire frames.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

An essential feature of a gait is the motion of the center of body mass (CoM). CoM motion is at larger risk for trespassing the base of support in the mediolateral direction than in the anteroposterior direction. How the CoM trajectory in the frontal plane changes depending on the speed or mode can thus provide insights about the neural control of stable gaits. Here, we reveal the speed- and mode-dependent modulations of the trajectory by utilizing a Lissajous curve. The current study clarifies that speed-dependent modulations are evident in walking. Between walking and running, there were significant mode-dependent modulations. In contrast, there were no significant speed-dependent modulations during running. Deviations from standard tendencies quantified via Lissajous curve fitting could be a sign of gait impairments and recovery after treatments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to develop and validate subject-specific, thoracolumbar spine multi-body skeletal models for evaluating spino-pelvic kinematics in a spinal deformity population. A new workflow for creating subject-specific spino-pelvic models in a weight-bearing position through computed tomography (CT) and biplanar radiography is described. As part of a two-step validation process the creation of such a model was first validated against a ground truth CT reconstruction of a plastinated cadaver. Secondly, biplanar radiographic images of one healthy and 12 adult spinal deformity subjects were obtained in two standing positions: upright and bent. Two subject-specific models for each of these subjects were then created to represent both standing positions. The result of inverse kinematics solutions, simulating the specific bending motion using the upright models, are compared with the models created in bent position, quantifying the marker-based spino-pelvic tracking accuracy. The workflow created spinal deformity models with mean accuracies between 0.71-1.95 mm and 1.25-2.27° for vertebral positions and orientations, respectively. In addition, the mean marker-based spino-pelvic tracking accuracies were between 0.9-1.8 mm and 2.9-5.6° for vertebral positions and rotations, respectively. This study presented the first validated biplanar radiography-based method to generate subject-specific spino-pelvic, rigid body models that allows the inclusion of subject-specific bone geometries, the personalization of the 3D weight-bearing spinal alignment with accuracy comparable to clinically used software for 3D reconstruction, and the localization of external markers in spinal deformity subjects.

Falling has been proposed as a potential strategy to decrease knee loading during landings. The purpose of this study was to compare impact forces, knee angles, and knee moments during natural landings, soft landings, and landings followed by falling after forward and vertical jumps, each under single or double-leg conditions. Sixteen male and sixteen female participants (age: 22.0 ± 2.9 years) completed each landing condition while kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected. In the natural landing condition, participants landed as they would in a sport setting. In the soft landing condition, participants landed as softly as possible with increased knee and hip flexion. In the falling condition, participants landed softly and then fell forward or backward onto a mat after forward and vertical jumps, respectively. The falling condition demonstrated the greatest initial and peak knee flexion angles, the least peak vertical ground reaction forces, and the least peak knee extension and adduction moments compared to the natural landing and soft landing conditions. The soft landing condition resulted in similar changes in landing mechanics compared to the natural landing, but the effect was limited for single-leg landings compared to double-leg landings. When the sports environment allows, falling appears to be a potential strategy to decrease knee loading when individuals must land on a single leg with sub-optimal body postures. Future studies are needed to develop progressive training of effective and safe falling techniques.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

When loaded in longitudinal tension, tendons often have a large Poisson's ratio (ν>2) that exceeds the limit of incompressibility for isotropic material (ν=0.5), indicating that tendon experiences volume loss, inducing poroelastic fluid exudation in the transverse direction. Therefore, transverse poroelasticity is an important contributor to tendon material behavior. Tendon hydraulic permeability which is required to evaluate the fluid flow contribution to viscoelasticity, is mostly unavailable, and where available, varies by several orders of magnitude. In this manuscript, we quantified the transverse poroelastic material parameters of rat tail tendon fascicles by conducting transverse osmotic loading experiments, in both tension and compression. We used a multi-start optimization method to evaluate the parameters using biphasic finite element modeling. Our tendon samples had a transverse hydraulic permeability of 10-4 to 10-5 mm4. (Ns)-1 and showed a significant tension-compression nonlinearity in the transverse direction. Further, using these results, we predict hydraulic permeability during longitudinal (fiber-aligned) tensile loading, and the spatial distribution of fluid flow during osmotic loading.

Previous evaluations of passive EOM tension have relied extensively on the experience and skill of ophthalmic surgeons, who generally perform such evaluations by gripping the eyeball and then pushing and pulling it. This methodology, named the forced duction test, has the significant limitation that the tension is felt subjectively via the forceps, with the results therefore not being quantifiable. Previous quantitative analyses have utilized several different types of equipment with implanted force transducers or have involved connecting the muscle tendon to a strain gauge. However, the associated equipment setups and recording systems are highly complex and rarely used outside research settings. This situation prompted the present study to develop a novel compact, quantifiable and clinically applicable device for measuring the passive tension in human EOMs for use in clinical practice. The device employs locking forceps and a tilting sensor to rule out effects of the gripping force and to compensate for changes in the force due to tilting, which improves the measurement accuracy. The performance of the device was investigated in 60 eyes of 30 consecutive anaesthetized patients immediately prior to ophthalmic surgery. The results showed that the measured EOM tension in each rectus muscles agreed with previous findings: 48.3 ± 14.5 g (0.82 ± 0.28 g/deg, mean ± SD) for the lateral rectus, 45.6 ± 13.2 g (0.82 ± 0.23 g/deg) for the medial rectus, 48.6 ± 14.7 g (0.71 ± 0.21 g/deg) for the inferior rectus and 53.4 ± 13.7 g (0.77 ± 0.25 g/deg) for the superior rectus.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Further characterization of the material properties is required for researchers to include these organs into models. This study characterized the mechanical properties of human and porcine gallbladder, bladder, and intestines using uniaxial tension loading from the rates of 25%/s to 500%/s. Small differences were observed between human and porcine gallbladder elastic modulus, failure stress, and failure strain. Strain rate was determined to be a significant factor for predicting porcine gallbladder elastic modulus and failure stress which were found to be 9.03 MPa and 1.83 MPa at 500%/s. Human bladder was observed to be slightly stiffer with a slightly lower failure stress than porcine specimens. Both hosts, however, demonstrated a strain rate dependency with the elastic modulus and failure stress increasing as the rate increased with the highest elastic modulus (2.16 MPa) and failure stress (0.65 MPa) occurring at 500%/s. Both human and porcine intestines were observed to be affected by the strain rate. Failure stress was found to be 1.6 MPa and 1.42 MPa at 500%/s for the human and porcine intestines respectively. For all properties found to be strain rate dependent, a numerical model was created to quantify the impact.

In the present work, we study the mechanical and energy absorption characteristics of density-graded foams designed for shoe midsoles. The stress-strain responses of polyurea foams with relative densities (nominal density of foam divided by the density of water) of 0.095, 0.23, and 0.35 are obtained experimentally and used as input to a semi-analytical model. Using this model, three-layered foam laminates with various gradients are designed and characterized in terms of their weight, strength, and energy absorption properties. We show that, in comparison with monolithic foams, significant improvement in strength and energy absorption performance can be achieved through density gradation. Our findings also suggest that there is not a single gradient that offers a superior combination of strength, energy absorption, and weight. Rather, an optimal gradient depends on the plantar location and pressure. Depending on the magnitude of the local plantar pressure, density gradients that lead to the highest specific energy absorption are identified for normal walking and running conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fluid properties of the vitreous is mainly the result of interactions between the characteristics of collagen type II and Hyaluronic Acid networks. Having a better understanding of the structure of each component and their changes during aging and various diseases such as diabetes can lead to better monitoring and treatment options. We study the effects of collagenase type II on 44 samples of porcine vitreous using an in situ rheological experiment in comparison with 18 eyes in a control group injected with Phosphate Buffered Saline Solution. We analyze the behavior of each component over time in both groups. We focus on the changes of viscosity and elasticity of the collagen network within the vitreous. The results of the analysis in this study show that the changes in the fluid properties of the vitreous after collagenase injection is driven by the structural alterations of the collagen network. Creep compliance values of the collagen network are significantly higher in the first group compared to the control group one hour and twenty-four hours after the injection. In contrast, creep compliance of the HA network shows no statistically significant change one hour after the injection in both groups.

This study was motivated by the need to use relevant biomechanical data from human ureters and microstructure-based material formulations for simulations of ureteral peristalsis and stenting. Our starting choice was the four-fiber family model that has proven its validity as a descriptor of the multiaxial response of cardiovascular tissues. The degree of model complexity, required for rigorous fits to passive quasi-static pressure-diameter-force data at several axial stretches, was systematically investigated. Ureteral segments from sixteen human autopsy subjects were evaluated. A diagonal and axial family model allowed equally-good fits as the full model for all age groups and ureteral regions; considerably better than those allowed by the phenomenological Fung-type model whose root-mean-square error of fitting was three-fold greater. This reduced model mimicked the structure seen in histologic sections, namely plentiful diagonal collagen fibers in the lamina propria and axial fibers in the muscle and adventitia. The paucity of elastin fibers and mixed muscle orientation justified the use of isotropic muscle-dominated matrix with small neo-Hookean parameter values. The significantly thicker lamina propria in the lower than the upper ureter of young subjects (312 ± 27 vs. 232 ± 26 μm; mean ± standard error) corroborated the significant regional differences in diagonal-fiber family parameter values. The significant muscle thickening with age (upper ureter: 373 ± 48 vs. 527 ± 67 μm; middle: 388 ± 29 vs. 575 ± 69 μm; lower: 440 ± 21 vs. 602 ± 71 μm) corroborated the significant age-related increase in axial-fiber family parameter values.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, all studies rely on post testing analysis, where anatomical joint coordinate systems (JCS) are created to generate clinically relevant data to describe wrist motion. The purpose of this study was to present a comparison of four JCS that have been previously described in literature. Five cadaveric upper limbs were passively cycled through a flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation motion pathways using a wrist motion simulator. During testing, clinical wrist angle was measured using a goniometer. Following testing, wrist angle was calculated using four previously described methods of generating wrist coordinate systems, to facilitate their comparison. For flexion-extension wrist motion, only subtle difference between JCSs were detected. When comparing the performance of each JCS to the measured wrist angle during flexion-extension wrist motion, the RMSE for all three analyzed axes were all within 6.6°. For radial-ulnar deviation wrist motion, again only subtle difference between JCSs were detected. When comparing the performance of each JCS to the measured wrist angle during radial-ulnar deviation wrist motion, the RMSE for all three analyzed axes were all within 7.1°. The results of this coordinate system comparison do not favor one JCS generation method over another, as all were found to be similar and the small differences that were found are likely not clinically significant. We support using any of the analyzed coordinate system generation methods; however, a practical advantage of using certain methods is that the required digitized points to form the coordinate systems are palpable on the skin's surface.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In a pathological context, the analysis of the Vertical component of Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) is frequently used to describe gait pattern. This paper aims to define gait profiles according to the relative difference between peaks of VGRF; a Rearfoot and a Forefoot profile revealing a more loading or push-off strategy. We evaluated 70 participants (24 with unilateral disease (Unilat-IC), 22 with bilateral disease (Bilat-IC) and 24 Controls) during a walk test on an instrumented treadmill. Results indicate that Unilat-IC patients present a Rearfoot-profile in both legs during the pain-free gait period, likely to stabilize their gait. With the onset and increase of pain, the asymptomatic leg changes for a Forefoot-profile. This asymmetrical pattern suggests that a compensatory mechanism occurred to unload the symptomatic (painful) leg, possibly creating an imbalance. In Bilat-IC and Controls subjects, a Forefoot-profile is found, with a symmetrical pattern. However, there is a trend for lower propulsive capacity in case of Bilat-IC due to ischemic pain, but patients did not have the ability to compensate as in Unilat-IC. Therefore, Bilat-IC should not be considered as a ""double"" Unilat-IC. This study highlights the existence of gait profiles based on VGRF in PAD-IC patients. These profiles are dependent on the type of disease. Analysis of these gait profiles can 1) provide a simple way to identify gait alterations and 2) participate in improving physical rehabilitation strategies in PAD-IC patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Here we investigated how the plantarflexion moment arm of the Achilles tendon is affected by using an instantaneous helical axis that moves with ankle motion as opposed to a single fixed joint axis that approximates the average axis of rotation. Twenty young healthy adults performed a series of weightbearing cyclical plantar- and dorsi-flexion motions. Motion analysis tracked the motions of markers placed on the foot and shank and also tracked an ultrasound probe imaging the Achilles tendon. Differences in ATma between the methods were investigated using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with factors of joint angle (+5°, 0°, -5°, -10°, -15°) and method (instantaneous helical axes, fixed axis). Moment arms computed between the two methods were moderately to strongly correlated, especially in the mid-range of motion (for 0° to 10° plantarflexion, all r2 > 0.619 and all p < 0.004). The two methods produced Achilles tendon moment arms that were comparable and not significantly different except in the most dorsiflexed position, when they differed on average by 9.35 ± 3.23 mm (p = 0.001). Our results suggest that either approach for locating the axis of ankle rotation would be appropriate for the purpose of estimating ATma, but that a fixed axis may be preferable because it is applicable over a greater range of ankle motion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In vitro work has shown positive results using the CentriMag device for right-sided Fontan support, however the generalizability across various patient anatomies and cannulations is unknown. Computational simulations are first validated against in vitro modeling, then used to assess generalizability and further explore hemodynamic metrics including relative pressure changes, hepatic flow distribution, wall shear stress and power added. Computational modeling matched previous in vitro work very well, with vessel flow rates and relative average pressure change each within 1%. Positive results were seen across all patient anatomies and cannulations. On average, pressure from the vena cava to pulmonary arteries increased by 5.4 mmHg corresponding to 32 mW of power added. Hepatic flow distribution and wall shear stress were within acceptable ranges, with an average hepatic flow distribution of 47% and all patients showing ≤ 1% of the total Fontan connection surface area at a wall shear stress above 150 Pa. The positive results previously seen using CentriMag as a right-sided Fontan support device were found to be repeatable across multiple patient anatomies and cannulations.

It was introduced over two decades ago, but has seen a resurgence of use in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical justification for this formula has thus far been limited. It is difficult to properly use any equation and interpret the results from analyses using it without a solid understanding of how it is derived as well as its underlying assumptions. In this communication, a thorough derivation of the distal foot power equation is provided first for the case where the foot is interacting with a rigid ground without sliding and then second generalized for situations when the foot may slide relative to a deformable ground surface. For the first case, the derivation makes clear that distal foot power represents the power due to the deviation of the foot from a rigid body state for the portion of the foot between its mass center (or other point of reference) and the center of pressure. For the second case, distal foot power represents not only the internal deformation power of the foot, but also the power due to sliding of the foot on the ground and the power due to deformation of the ground near the point of contact.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Progressively loading the healing tendon has been associated with superior outcomes, but the loading profiles that patients experience throughout rehabilitation have not yet been established. In this study, we developed and calibrated an instrumented immobilizing boot paradigm that is aimed at longitudinally quantifying patient loading biomechanics to develop personalized rehabilitation protocols. We used a 3-part instrumented insole to quantify the ankle loads generated by the Achilles tendon and secured a load cell inline with the posterior strut of the immobilizing boot to quantify boot loading. We then collected gait data from five healthy young adults to demonstrate the validity of this instrumented immobilizing boot paradigm to assess Achilles tendon loading during ambulation. We developed a simple calibration procedure to improve the measurement fidelity of the instrumented insole needed to quantify Achilles tendon loading while ambulating with an immobilizing boot. By assessing Achilles tendon loading with the ankle constrained to 0 degrees and 30 degrees plantar flexion, we confirmed that walking with the foot supported in plantar flexion decreased Achilles tendon loading by 60% (P < 0.001). This instrumented immobilizing boot paradigm leverages commercially available sensors and logs data using a small microcontroller secured to the boot and a handheld device, making our paradigm capable of continuously monitoring biomechanical loading outside of the lab or clinic.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, we find that the compressibility of liver tissues is also closely related to the initial specimen volume according to the confined compression tests: the samples with smaller initial volume exhibit more compressible behavior compared to the larger ones. To include this initial-volume dependent effect, we developed a novel volumetric strain energy model with two variables, i.e., the bulk modulus and the compressibility factor. A detailed scheme was proposed as well to identify these two parameters, and the relationship between the bulk modulus and the initial volume was clarified. Findings from this study will help to deepen the understanding of the biomechanical properties of soft tissues. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Liver is a highly vascular organ and traditionally assumed to be an incompressible medium. However, through the confined compression tests, we found that the samples with smaller initial volumes exhibit more compressible behavior. Hence, we developed a novel strain energy density model to characterize the initial-volume dependent hyperelastic response, and found that the bulk modulus of liver tissues is positively related to the initial volume. Our results suggest that the compressibility of liver tissues should be considered in the future study of liver biomechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Impairment in these force couples would theoretically result in impaired ball-and-socket kinematics. Although less frequently used than traditional kinematic descriptors (e.g., Euler angles, joint translations), helical axes are capable of identifying alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics by quantifying the variability (i.e., dispersion) in axis orientation and position during motion. Consequently, assessing glenohumeral helical dispersion may provide indirect evidence of rotator cuff function. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the extent to which rotator cuff pathology is associated with alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics. Fifty-one participants were classified into one of five groups based on an assessment of the supraspinatus using diagnostic imaging: asymptomatic healthy, asymptomatic tendinosis, asymptomatic partial-thickness tear, asymptomatic full-thickness tear, symptomatic full-thickness tear. Glenohumeral kinematics were quantified during coronal plane abduction using a biplane x-ray system and described using instantaneous helical axes. The degree to which glenohumeral motion coincided with ball-and-socket kinematics was described using the angular and positional dispersion about the optimal helical axis and pivot, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups in angular dispersion. However, symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear had significantly more positional dispersion than asymptomatic individuals with a healthy supraspinatus or tendinosis. These findings suggest that symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear exhibit impaired ball-and-socket kinematics, which is believed to be associated with a disruption of the glenohumeral force couples.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The ITB has been extensively studied for its relevance to injury, but not much is known about its elastic properties. We aimed to investigate the site- and joint angle-dependence of ITB elasticity. We tested twelve healthy males (22-30 years; in vivo) and twelve male cadavers (69-93 years; cadaver). The Young's modulus of the ITB was measured in the longitudinal direction at five sites (over the proximal, middle, and distal bellies of the vastus lateralis (VL), superior border of the patella, and between femur and tibia) of the right limb, by ultrasound shear wave elastography (in vivo) and the tensile test (cadaver). Joint angle-dependence was also studied for nine different positions (knee angles at 0, 25, 90˚ x hip angles at 0, 40, 90˚) (in vivo). Over VL, the ITB was more compliant at the distal (17.6-190.1 kPa; in vivo, 219.4 ± 68.8 MPa; cadaver, mean ± SD) than other sites (24.2-221.4 kPa, 337.9-362.7 MPa).

Similarly, when deactivated, the force remains higher following active stretch than following an isometric condition (passive force enhancement; PFE). RFE and PFE have been associated with the sarcomere protein titin, but skeletal and cardiac titin have different structures, and results regarding RFE in cardiac muscle have been inconsistent and contradictory. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if cardiac muscle exhibits RFE and PFE. Skinned fibre bundles (n = 10) were activated isometrically at a sarcomere length of 2.2 μm and actively stretched by 15% of their length. The resultant active and passive forces were compared to the corresponding forces obtained for purely isometric contractions at the long length. RFE was observed in all fibre bundles, averaging 5.5 ± 2.5% (ranging from 2.3 to 9.4%). PFE was observed in nine of the ten bundles, averaging 11.1 ± 6.5% (ranging from -2.1 to 18.7%). Stiffness was not different between the active isometric and the force enhanced conditions, but was higher following deactivation from the force-enhanced compared to the isometric reference state. We conclude that there is RFE and PFE in cardiac muscle. We speculate that cardiac muscle has the same RFE capability as skeletal muscle, and that the most likely mechanism for the RFE and PFE is the engagement of a passive structural element during active stretching.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Healthy young athletes (n = 32) completed single-leg drop vertical jump landings where the required landing leg was unanticipated. Trials were categorized as failed if the participant shifted their base of support during the landing. Joint kinematics and muscle activation amplitudes were time normalized over the flight and landing phases. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to compare landings and a moving average convergence divergence oscillator was then calculated to determine where failed and successful waveforms began to diverge prior to reaching statistical significance. SPM determined that participants performed the failed trials with reduced pelvic tilt towards the landing limb during 41-69% of the flight phase, greater trunk flexion angle during 31-100% of the landing phase and greater trunk tilt away from the landing limb during 3-13% and 21-90% of the landing phase. Greater rectus femoris activation during the failed trials was identified during 88-100% of the flight phase, as well as 1-4% and 71-97% of the landing phase. Greater gluteus medius and biceps femoris activation was also identified in the failed trials during 54-72% and 76-89% of the landing phase respectively. These findings indicate that the control of proximal joints has an important role in determining if a participant will fail a landing; and that how athletes prepare for a landing may be more relevant than the kinematics following ground contact.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In recent years, researchers have found that the ""body-armour"" is composed of multi-layer materials with different elastic modulus from inside to outside. The gradient change rule of the formed material modulus reflects the evolutionary history of insect cuticle's adaptation to external changes. In this article, the mechanical properties of spatial hierarchical architecture of insect cuticle, especially for the shield-like beetle elytra under impact loading, was investigated to reveal the impact resistance strategy and in-depth mechanisms of crashworthy protection. The results show that both discontinuity at the cuticle layers interface and the distributions of stiffness gradients through layers' thickness have a great influence on preventing stress wave propagation and improving impact-tolerance. Insect cuticle such as beetle elytra with discontinuous exponential stiffness gradient (DC-EXP) along the thickness has been identified to result in the minimum values of stress and interaction force under impact loading, which leads to the best impact resistance property and defensive effect. Furthermore, we compared and discussed the protective properties of insect elytra with different sclerotized endocuticle under quasi-static compression and impact loading, respectively. The knowledge gained from this work reveals the advantages of nature's choice of the stiffness distribution and may serve to inspire further research of developing advanced multifunctional structures with improved impact resistance capability by programming reasonable stiffness distribution.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The first application concerns planar kinematics in the presence of soft-tissue artefacts and the second application concerns rigid body kinematics in 3D with finite helical axes (FHA). The percentage of simulations in which BIK was more accurate than least-squares based methods was only high in cases of relatively large noise magnitudes (noise SD >5 mm) or when the rotation magnitude was very small (⩽5 deg) in the 3D FHA model. Correlated parameters are the likely culprit of the low performance of BIK. Also computation time is a major deficit of the BIK approach (±20 s for the movement between two time frames).

A repeated measures mixed model investigated the impact of potential predictors (sagittal, frontal, transverse plane and total knee joint moments, knee angular velocity, age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and Tegner Activity Score (TAS)). Most of the amplitudes variance is explained by between-subject differences (tibia: 66.6%; patella: 75.8%), and of the median power frequencies variance by the movement condition (tibia: 97.6%; patella: 98.9%).

This study investigated how dynamic forces distributed over a soft seat compared to that over a rigid seat wtih vertical vibration excitation. Fourteen male subjects sitting on a rigid seat and on foam cushions of two different thickness with four different heights of footrest were exposed to vertical whole-body vibration between 0.5 and 20 Hz at 0.5 ms-2 r.m.s. Dynamic forces were measured beneath the ischial tuberosities, the middle thighs, and the front thighs and the transmissibility of the cushion was measured to the three locations. The resonance in the transmissibility of the cushion was found around 4 Hz to the ischial tuberosities but around 6-8 Hz to the front thighs. Differences between the apparent mass measured with the cushioned seat and the rigid seat decreased with increasing height of footrest. A multi-body dynamic model that can predict the dynamic forces beneath the ischial tuberosities and thighs was applied to identify the cause for the differences. It was suggested the differences can be caused by the variations in vibration over the surface of soft seats, especially when the contact area beneath the thighs was large, and by changes in the effective stiffness and damping of the human body when the contact area beneath the thighs was reduced.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study aims to investigate the compressive properties of skeletal muscles due to different species, loading rates and fiber orientations, in order to obtain available parameters of specific material laws as references for building or improving the human body model concerning both modeling accuracy and computational cost. A series of compressive experiments of skeletal muscles were implemented for human gastrocnemius muscle, bovine and porcine hind leg muscle. To avoid long-time preservation effects, all experimental tests were carried out in 24 h after that the samples were harvested. Considering computational cost and generally used in the previous human body models, one-order hyperelastic Ogden model and three-term simplified viscoelastic quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) were selected for numerical analysis. Inverse finite element analysis was employed to obtain corresponding material parameters. With good fitting records, the simulation results presented available material parameters for human body model establishment, and also indicated significant differences of muscle compressive properties due to species, loading rates and fiber orientations. When considering one-order Ogden law, it is worthy of noting that the inversed material parameters of the porcine muscles are similar to those of the human gastrocnemius regardless of fiber orientations. In conclusion, the obtained material parameters in the present study can be references for global human body and body segment modeling.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The frame subtraction method can calculate the motions of a subject, and might be easier to implement, with lower costs. However, validity of the evaluation of postural stability using this method have not been validated yet. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to verify criterion-related validity of the frame subtraction scores and the center of pressure (COP) parameters during maintenance of single leg standing. Twenty two healthy young subjects participated in this study. Motion tasks comprised right leg standing with eyes open and closed. The total length of COP displacements (LNG), Root mean square (RMS) area, anterior - posterior (AP) range, medial - lateral (ML) range were recorded using the force plate. Simultaneously, the motion images were acquired with digital video cameras from the front and right sides. After the motion images were analyzed using the frame subtraction method, the frame subtraction scores (maximum / sum of the frame subtraction score on each plane / the frontal and sagittal planes) were measured. To confirm the validity, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the frame subtraction scores and the COP parameters was calculated. The sum of the frame subtraction score on the frontal plane was significantly correlated with all COP displacements in the single leg standing. The result of this study indicated that the frame subtraction method could be applied to the evaluation of balance task with postural sway such as maintenance of single leg standing.

HAs can be analyzed during walking, providing information on joint stability. The study aim was to describe knee HAs dispersion during walking in dominant and non-dominant legs of young and elderly healthy subjects. Twenty young (YG: age 23.3 ± 2.4 years) and twenty elderly (EG: age 69.3 ± 4.6 years) healthy subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at a self-selected speed with reflective markers placed bilaterally on thighs and shanks to detect HAs dispersion and knee kinematics with an optoelectronic system. HAs dispersion was described during the following four phases of gait cycle: (1) flexion from 95% of the previous gait cycle to 10% of the subsequent gait cycle, (2) extension from 10% to 40%, (3) flexion from 40% to 75% and (4) extension from 75% to 95% of the gait cycle. Mean Distance (MD) and Mean Angle (MA) were used as HAs dispersion indexes during each gait phase. Participants showed greater MD and MA in sagittal and frontal planes during the first and second phases. EG revealed higher MD (p = 0.001) and MA (p < 0.001) during the first phase and higher MA (p = 0.001) during the fourth phase in both dominant and non-dominant legs on the sagittal plane.

Fluid flow within trabecular porosity under cyclic loading is one of the factors stimulating the biological response of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. However, the relation between loading directions and interstitial fluid flow was seldom studied. In the present study, a finite element model based on micro-computed tomographic reconstructions is built by using a mouse femur. Results from the fluid-solid coupling numerical simulation indicate that the loading in different directions generates a distinct distribution of von Mises stress in the bone matrix and a fluid shear stress (FSS) in the bone marrow. The loading along the physiological direction leads to a more uniform distribution of solid stress and produces an FSS level beneficial to the biological response of osteoblasts and osteoclasts compared with those along the non-physiological direction. There was a minimum threshold line of wall FSS with a specific solid stress at the bone surface, suggesting that the wall FSS is mainly induced by the solid strain. These results may offer fundamental data in understanding the mechanical environment around osteoblasts and osteoclasts and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of mechanical loading-induced bone remodeling.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and robust procedure for defining anatomical coordinate systems for the talus and calcaneus. Four methods were evaluated based upon their anatomic consistency across subjects, repeatability, and their correspondence to functional axes of rotation. The four systems consisted of: 1) interactively identified bony landmarks, 2) a principal component analysis, 3) automatically identified bony landmarks, and 4) translating the tibial coordinate system to the hindfoot bones. The four systems were evaluated on 40 tali and 40 calcanei. The functional axes of rotation were determined using dynamic biplane radiography to image the hindfoot during gait. Systems 2 and 3 were the most repeatable and consistent due to the lack of operator intervention when defining coordinate systems. None of the coordinate systems corresponded well to functional axes of rotation during gait. System 3 is recommended over System 2 because it more closely mimics established bone angles measured clinically, especially for the calcaneus. This study presents an automated method for defining anatomic coordinate systems in the talus and calcaneus that does not rely on manual placement of markers or fitting of spheres to the bone surfaces which are less reliable due to operator-dependent measurements. Using this automated method will make it easier to compare hindfoot kinematics results across research studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The alignment of the prosthesis may influence the movement strategies people with TTA use to transfer from sit-to-stand by affecting foot placement. The purpose of this study was to determine how shifting the prosthetic foot anterior and posterior relative to the socket affects movement strategies used to transfer from sit-to-stand. To aid in interpretation, we compared movement strategies between people with and without TTA. Nine people with TTA and nine sex-, and age-matched non-amputee controls completed five self-paced sit-to-stand trials. With the posterior alignment, participants with TTA had 1) smaller braking GRF impulse on the prosthetic side and greater impulse on the intact side compared to the anterior alignment, 2) no significant differences between sides, which suggests greater braking impulse symmetry compared to anterior and prescribed alignments, and 3) smaller axial trunk range of motion compared to the prescribed alignment. There were also differences between participants with TTA and controls in braking GRF impulse, knee extension moment, anterior/posterior center of pressure position, and lateral and axial trunk range of motion. Based on these results, shifting the prosthetic foot posterior to the socket may be a useful tool to reduce braking impulse asymmetry and trunk motion in people with TTA during sit-to-stand. Thus, prosthetic alignment can have important implications for the comfort and ability of people with TTA to transfer from sit-to-stand as well as for development of secondary health conditions like low back pain, which is associated with compensatory movements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Both femoral anteversion and retroversion alter passive and active rotation of the hip and are associated with intra-articular or extra-articular impingement. However, little is known about the effect of abnormal femoral version on intra-articular hip contact stresses. To quantify the effect of femoral version on hip contact stress, five cadaveric pelvis specimens were mechanically tested with a hip-specific Tekscan sensor inserted in the joint space. Specimens were oriented in a heel-strike position and loaded with 1000 N of compressive force. Pressure measurements were recorded by the Tekscan sensor with the femur oriented in 0°, 15°, and 30° of version. At the completion of testing, specimens were locked into place at 0° and post-test CT scans were obtained to register the pressure sensor measurements to the joint anatomy. There were minor changes in contact area (<7%) and translation of the peak contact stress location (8.8 ± 7.6 mm). There was no significant change in peak contact stress (p = 0.901) in either the retroverted (0°) or anteverted (30°) conditions relative to normal version (15°) under identical gait-related loading conditions. While abnormalities in patient gait and resultant joint loading caused by femoral version abnormalities may contribute to hip pain, the present findings would suggest that future joint degeneration in hips with version abnormalities are not simply the result of abnormal contact stress induced by joint incongruity due to femoral version abnormalities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Clinically meaningful tibiofemoral kinematics are defined as the six relative rigid body motions expressed in a joint coordinate system where the motions about and along the axes conform to clinical definitions and are free from kinematic crosstalk errors. To obtain clinically meaningful tibiofemoral kinematics, coordinate systems must meet certain requirements which neither have been explicitly stated nor in fact satisfied in any previous publication known to the author. Starting with the joint coordinate system of Grood and Suntay (1983) where motions conform to clinical definitions, the body-fixed axes must correspond to the functional (i.e. actual) axes in flexion-extension and internal-external axial rotation to avoid kinematic crosstalk errors in rotations and both functional axes must be body-fixed throughout knee flexion. To avoid kinematic crosstalk errors in translations, the origins of the femoral and tibial Cartesian coordinate systems, which serve as stepping stones for computing translations, must lie on the functional body-fixed axes. Neither the paper by Grood and Suntay nor the ISB recommendation (Wu et al., 2002) which adopted the joint coordinate system of Grood and Suntay explains these requirements. Indeed meeting these requirements conflicts with the ISB recommendation thus indicating the need for revision to this recommendation. Future studies where clinically meaningful tibiofemoral kinematics are of interest should be guided by the requirements described herein.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thus, the purpose of this article is to explore the various methods used to report impact location and ATD head pose for sport-related head impact testing and provide recommendations for standardizing these descriptions. A database search and exclusion process identified 137 articles that met the review criteria. Only 4 of the 137 articles provided a description similar to the method we propose to describe ATD pose and impact location. We thus propose a method to unambiguously convey the impact location and pose of the ATD based on the sequence, quantifiable design, and articulation of ATD mount joints. This reporting method has been used to a limited extent in the literature, but we assert that adoption of this method will help to standardize the reporting of ATD headform pose and impact location as well as aid in the replication of impact test protocols across laboratories.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Hopping is generally discouraged by therapists but many patients report hopping, and the potential deleterious effects of frequent hopping on knee joint health remains unclear. Mechanical fatigue due to repeated exposures to increased or abnormal loading on the intact limb is thought to be a primary contributor to the high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis among individuals with unilateral lower limb amputation. We aimed to compare knee joint mechanics between single-leg hopping and walking at self-selected paces among individuals with unilateral lower limb-loss, and estimated the associated probability of knee cartilage failure. Thirty-two males with traumatic unilateral lower limb-loss (22 transtibial, 10 transfemoral) hopped and walked at a self-selected pace along a 15-m walkway. Peak knee moments were input to a phenomenological model of cartilage fatigue to estimate the damage and long-term failure probability of the medial knee cartilage when hopping vs. walking. We estimate that each hop accumulates as much damage as at least 8 strides of walking (p < 0.001), and each meter of hopping accumulates as much damage as at least 12 m of walking (p < 0.001). The 30-year failure probability of the medial knee cartilage exceeded a ""coin-flip"" chance (50%) when performing more than 197 hops per day. Although a convenient mode of ambulation for persons with unilateral lower limb-loss, to mitigate risk for knee osteoarthritis it is advisable to minimize exposure to single-leg forward hopping.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Markerless motion capture system (MLS) using an infrared sensor such as Microsoft Kinect has been used for gait analysis. Several studies have shown that kinematic measurements of trunk and lower limb joint angles during walking measured by MLS are valid. However, the reproducibility, presence of systematic error, or degree of random error of kinematic measurements during walking using MLS with Kinect v2 were not demonstrated. This study was made to confirm the reliability of kinematic measurements using Kinect v2 during gait. Twenty-two young, injury-free individuals volunteered to participate. Walks were made at 2 miles per hour (mph) on both the flatland and the treadmill. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated, systematic errors identified, and minimal detectable changes (MDCs) were estimated to assess the reliability of kinematic measurements of trunk, hip, and knee joint angles during walking. For trunk angles measured on the flatland, ICC was higher than 0.6, systematic error was smaller, and MDC was 2.2° smaller than that in gait on the treadmill (6.6°). In hip joint angles measured on the flatland, although systematic error was slight, ICC was not higher than on the treadmill and MDC exceeded 5°. The results for the knee joint were similar to those of the hip joint.

Altered neuromotor control of step kinematics would be expected to manifest as changes in the noise-related characteristics of the step kinematic time series. This study determined the effects of eliminating feedback from the lower visual field and reducing treadmill-belt width on the noise characteristics of step width time series and statistical measures of step width variability during treadmill walking. We hypothesized that eliminating feedback from the lower visual field and reducing treadmill-belt width would both alter the noise characteristics of step width time series, reflected by decreased fractal scaling, and increase statistical measures of step width variability. Eighteen young adults performed four randomly ordered walking trials during which we manipulated visual feedback from the lower visual field (normal and obstructed) and treadmill-belt width (wide and narrow). Reducing treadmill-belt width, but not eliminating feedback from the lower visual field, significantly reduced the fractal scaling of step width time series, indicating a shift towards white, uncorrelated noise. These results suggest that accounting for the influence of treadmill-belt width on step width time series may be an important consideration in both laboratory and clinical settings. Further work is needed to clarify the effects of vision on measures of step width, identify the mechanism(s) underlying the observed shift towards white, uncorrelated noise associated with reduced treadmill-belt width, and to assess the potential relationship between the noise characteristics of step width time series and fall risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One of the major contributors to this motion is the deltoid muscle group and for this, an accurate modeling of the lines of action is indispensable. The aim of this work was to utilize a torus obstacle wrapping approach for the deltoids of an existing shoulder model and assess the feasibility of the approach during humeral abduction. The shoulder model from the AnyBody™ modeling system was used as a platform. The size of the tori is based on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach and several kinematic couplings are implemented to determine the trajectories of the tori during abduction. To assess the model behavior, the moment arms of the virtual muscle elements and the resultant glenohumeral joint reaction force (GHJF) were compared with reference data from the literature during abduction of the humerus in the range 20°-120°. The root mean square error for the anterior, lateral and posterior part between the simulated muscle elements and reference data from the literature was 3.9, 1.7 and 5.8 mm, respectively. The largest deviation occurred on the outer elements of the muscle groups, with 12.6, 10.4 and 20.5 mm, respectively. During abduction, there is no overlapping of the muscle elements and these are in continuous contact with the torus obstacles, thus enabling a continuous force transmission. This results in a rising trend of the resultant GHJF. The torus obstacle approach as a wrapping method for the deltoid muscles provides a guided muscle pathing by simultaneously approximating the curvature of the deltoid muscle. The results from the comparison of the simulated moment arms and the resultant GHJF are in accordance with those in the literature in the range 20°-120° of abduction. Although this study shows the strength of the torus obstacle as a wrapping approach, the method of fitting the tori according to MRI data was not suitable.

The majority of studies utilizing SWE have focused primarily on upper-extremity muscles, with little attention attributed to lower-extremity muscles. In addition, of the studies that have been published, various joint and muscle positions have been examined, rendering it difficult to compare results across studies. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine lower extremity medial hamstring muscles (semitendinosus and semimembranosus) and to determine how hip position (0° versus 90°) and muscle position (knee flexed versus extended) impacted resulting shear modulus values. Ten subjects varying widely in age participated in this study, and their hamstring stiffness was assessed in four separate positions: seated with the knee flexed and extended, and lying prone with the knee flexed and extended. Higher shear modulus values were found at the group-level when participants were seated compared to prone (hip placed at 90° compared to 0°). In addition, higher values were also found when the knee was extended compared to flexed, but only when the hip was placed at 90° (not 0°). These results demonstrate that joint and muscle position, particularly when assessing the hamstrings, largely impact resulting shear modulus values. Therefore, joint and muscle position need to be systematically controlled for and reported when establishing normative ranges for shear modulus values across specific age groups. This will enable physicians to more precisely determine whether patients' shear modulus values indicate clinically meaningful differences in comparison to normative data.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of load carriage on trunk-pelvis coordination in running. Thirty healthy adults performed running while wearing a 20% bodyweight backpack, and without load. Vector coding was used to quantify trunk-pelvis segmental coordination and its variability during the stance phase of running. The four coordination patterns were: 1) anti-phase (segments moving in opposite directions), in-phase (segments moving in same directions), trunk-only phase (only trunk movement), and pelvic-only phase (only pelvic movement). For each plane, the percentage of stance phase spent in a specific coordination pattern was quantified. Coordination variability for each plane was averaged over the stance phase. Mixed effects models were used to analyse the effects of load, adjusted for the covariate of sex, on coordination and its variability. Running with load increased trunk-only coordination in the sagittal plane (P < 0.001), increased anti-phase coordination in the frontal plane (P < 0.001), reduced trunk-only phase coordination in axial rotation (P < 0.001), and increased coordination variability in all three planes (Flexion-Extension: P < 0.001; Lateral flexion: P = 0.03; Axial rotation: P < 0.001).

The potential for the foot to contribute to this spring-like mechanism has been established. However, due to previous modelling approaches assuming a rigid-foot segment, it is unknown if ankle and foot quasi-stiffness can be actively regulated, quasi-stiffness being a measure of joint deformation under an applied load. In this study, we sought to determine if midfoot quasi-stiffness was increased in a similar manner as the ankle with increasing load demands, and if these changes were mediated by increased activation of the intrinsic foot muscles. We also quantified differences in measures of ankle joint quasi-stiffness attributable to the modelling assumption of a rigid-foot segment versus a multi-segment foot. Twenty-two healthy individuals performed a single-leg hopping task at three frequencies (2.0 Hz, 2.3 Hz, and 2.6 Hz) while measuring lower limb kinematics, kinetics and muscle activation (EMG). Kinetics and kinematics were calculated at the midfoot and using two different ankle models: rigid-foot model (shank-foot) and an anatomical ankle (shank-calcaneus). Midfoot quasi-stiffness increased with hopping-frequency (p < 0.05), while contact phase intrinsic foot muscle activation decreased (p < 0.05). The assumption of a rigid-foot model overestimated ankle ROM by ~10° and underestimated ankle quasi-stiffness by 45-60%. This study demonstrates that midfoot quasi-stiffness increases with hopping-frequency; however, the mechanism for these changes remains unclear. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the need to assess the ankle and foot independently, using appropriate models, to avoid significant inaccuracies in basic ankle kinematic and kinetic outputs, such as range of motion and joint quasi-stiffness.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of the present study was to examine the role(s) of SPA associated with a single step task (SST). Ten healthy young adults performed series of SST on a force-plate. A 2-DOF mechanical model was used to separate the dynamics of the swing leg and the dynamics of the rest of the body, corresponding to the focal and the postural component of the SST, respectively. The postural component was plotted against the focal one during SPA (from heel-off to foot-contact), and this plot was modelled as a Lissajous ellipse. Result showed that this ellipse systematically ran through the same three quadrants of the diagram. For each of these quadrants, the role of the postural component in regards to the focal one was interpreted according to the relative orientation of the postural and focal dynamics. Results thus showed that SPA ensured the following successive roles: counter-perturbation of swing leg dynamics following heel-off, propulsion of swing leg, counter-perturbation of swing leg dynamics again, and then braking swing leg movement. These new findings contribute to a better knowledge of postural adjustments properties, and may provide new insights for understanding balance troubles with aging and in neurological patients (e.g. people with Parkinson's disease).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, most investigations have utilized isometric study designs, with little consideration for wrist dynamics or changes in posture. The purpose of the present study was to assess forearm muscle activity during the execution of dynamic wrist flexion/extension in multiple forearm orientations (pronation/supination). In 12 young adult males, surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from eight muscles of the dominant arm: flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), extensor digitorum (ED), biceps brachii (BB) and triceps brachii (TB). While grasping a handle, participants performed dynamic wrist flexion/extension using a three-degrees-of-freedom wrist manipulandum. The robotic device applied torque to the handle, in either a flexion or extension direction, and in one of three forearm postures (30° supinated/neutral/30° pronated). Results indicated that forearm posture had minimal influence on forearm muscle activity, but significantly altered the activity of the biceps and triceps brachii. Movement phase (concentric-eccentric) dictated muscle activity in every muscle. Interestingly, muscle activity in the eccentric phase was equal between the two applied handle torques, regardless of whether the muscle acted as the agonist or antagonist. Co-contraction ratios were higher in the flexion conditions (flexion: 2.28 ± 2.04, extension: 0.32 ± 0.27), suggesting significantly greater wrist extensor activity-likely a contribution to wrist joint stability. This highlights the vulnerability of the wrist extensor muscles to overuse injuries in settings requiring prolonged use of dynamic wrist exertions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty-four participants, 17 per group, volunteered to participate. Participants were asked to stand barefoot on a force plate before initiating gait upon hearing an auditory cue. Reaction time, anticipatory postural adjustment phase time, as well as normalized peak COP excursion during the anticipatory postural adjustment phase was calculated. Response time of Soleus and Tibialis Anterior muscles were concurrently recorded via electromyography. The results demonstrate a longer reaction time and shorter anticipatory postural adjustment phase time in the CAI group (p < 0.05). No significant between group differences in peak normalized COP excursion were noted (p > 0.05). Muscle onset patterns differed between groups as those with CAI demonstrated earlier Soleus activation compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The results suggest that those with CAI have an altered GI motor control strategy as evidenced by reduced or absent Soleus muscle inhibition during APA phase of GI relative to controls. The APA phase is controlled by the secondary motor area, therefore, the presence of motor control alterations in CAI patients may be due to a supra-spinal alterations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of localized tendon remodeling on tear propagation for simulated supraspinatus tendon tears. A validated computational model of a supraspinatus tendon using subject-specific geometry and material properties with a 1 cm wide anterior tear was used. The medial edge of the supraspinatus tendon was displaced 5 mm to induce tear propagation and cohesive elements were used to model tear propagation. Four remodeling scenarios were investigated: (1) Baseline (no remodeling), (2) Positive remodeling (increased fiber stiffness) and (3) Negative remodeling (decreased fiber stiffness) at tear tips, and (4) Negative remodeling along the medial-lateral tear edge. Output parameters included the amount of tear propagation, critical load to propagate the tear, and maximum principal stress at the tear tips. Positive remodeling at the tear tips resulted in the largest amount of tear propagation (18.4 mm), highest peak maximum principal stress (25.2 MPa), and lowest critical load to propagate the tear (249N). Conversely, negative remodeling at the tear tips resulted in the least amount of tear propagation (16 mm), lowest peak maximum principal stress (17.6 MPa) and highest critical load to propagate the tear (278N). Overall, remodeling at the tear tips has the greatest effect on tear propagation. Therefore, a better method for clinicians to measure tendon stiffness at the tear tips would be helpful to improve outcome of patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty-six healthy young men were equally and randomly assigned to an ICE group, a CDH group, or a non-cooling (NON) group. All participants performed 80 maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs) of the plantar flexors as a fatiguing task. MVC torque and voluntary activation were determined before, immediately after, and 20 min after the fatiguing task. Evoked torque was similarly assessed except for immediately after the task. In the ICE and CDH groups, the triceps surae was cooled for 5 min using ice and CDH, starting 5 min after the fatiguing task, respectively. The MVC torque and voluntary activation were higher in order of before >20 min after >immediately after the fatiguing task regardless of group, and those time-course changes did not differ between the groups. A decrease in the evoked torque from before to 20 min after the fatiguing task was observed in the ICE and NON groups but not in the CDH group. These results suggest that cooling muscle with CDH can facilitate recovery from peripheral muscle fatigue. This may be due to an increase in blood flow caused by carbon dioxide contained within the CDH, and indicates the potential of CDH as a recovery tool after fatiguing exercise.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As a sensitive measure of fall risk, the distance between the center of pressure (COP) and center of mass (COM) is currently assessed through discrete points assumed to represent physiological important fall mechanisms. However, it is unclear if these discrete points are appropriate measures of fall risk. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a waveform analysis technique that removes this possibly biased a priori approach. Sixteen healthy young adults (8 males, 8 females; Age: 29 ± 3.6 years, Height: 1.7 ± 0.9 m, Mass: 75 ± 16 kg) performed two tasks that disturbed dynamic stability: voluntary stepping at different step lengths, and forward perturbations at different accelerations. COP-COM distance magnitudes were extracted during the first step in both tasks at discrete points typically assessed in previous research. Discrete point analysis (DPA) was performed on these discrete points and SPM analysis was completed on the COP-COM distance waveform. The results from the study found that SPM analysis identified equivalent significant differences to DPA and identified additional significant differences elsewhere in the COP-COM distance waveform that were not able to be detected by DPA. Two key advantages from using SPM: (1) reduction of possibly biased a priori selection, and (2) increased efficiency and reduced time-cost in data post-processing as inherent variability can limit the detection of discrete points resulting in identifying physiologically different discrete points across trials. This study suggests the use of SPM as a sensitive data analysis approach in detecting fall risk as an alternative to DPA.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Local generation of stress (normal and shear) is significant even in 2D. Normal stress is primarily accumulated within a core region of migrating cell clusters during their movement through the dense environment and during the collisions of migrating cell clusters caused by uncorrelated motility. Shear stress can be significant within perturbed boundary layers around migrating clusters. Cells are more sensitive to the action of shear stress compared with normal stress. Shear stress of a few Pa significantly influences cell state. Prior studies have shown that collectively migrating cells move in such a way to minimize this stress, but it has not yet been determined how cells effectively minimize it. Deeper insight into possible cell mechanisms for minimizing undesirable shear stress would be of great importance because it may help to direct morphogenesis, accelerate wound healing or prevent cancer invasion. In the proposed model three primary mechanisms in which cells may reduce shear are given: decreasing speed, tissue thickening, and/or reducing slip effects. Suggestions obtained from the proposed model indicate a need for further experimental studies that will reveal whether the heterogeneity in the cell-cell adhesion types correlates well with the stiffness inhomogeneity, or changes in the adhesion clustering, cytoskeletal linkage or some other modification to the adhesion complex (adherens junctions or tight junctions) are occurring to influence overall adhesive strength.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, this finding has been derived mostly from isometric or wrist flexion-extension protocols, with little consideration for wrist dynamics or radial-ulnar wrist deviations. The purpose of this study was to assess forearm muscle activity during the execution of dynamic wrist radial-ulnar deviation in various forearm orientations (pronation/supination).

The robotic device applied torque to the handle, in either a radial or ulnar direction, and in one of three forearm postures (30° supinated/neutral/30° pronated). Results indicated that forearm posture influenced the muscles acting upon the hand (FDS/ED), whereas movement phase (concentric-eccentric) and torque direction influenced nearly every muscle. The ECR demonstrated the greatest task-dependency of all forearm muscles, which is possibly reflective of forearm muscle lines of action. Co-contraction ratios were much higher in radial trials than ulnar (Radial: 1.20 ± 0.78, Ulnar: 0.28 ± 0.18, P < 0.05), suggesting greater FCU and ECU contribution to wrist joint stability in radial-ulnar movement.

As an alternative, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached and aligned to the shank might be used. This study aimed to investigate the validity, inter-rater reliability and optimal location of a single IMU on the shank to assess the SVA. Thirteen healthy participants (7 m/6f, mean age: 45 ± 18 years) were recorded during quiet standing and barefoot walking using a 3D motion capture system and, simultaneously, with IMUs on the shank. The IMUs were anatomically placed and aligned at two different locations, i.e. anterior, in line with the tibial tuberosity and midline of the ankle (anterior IMU), and lateral, in line with the lateral epicondyle and lateral malleolus (lateral IMU). For each participant, the IMUs were placed by two different researchers. A paired t-test, Bland Altmann analysis (mean difference, repeatability coefficient) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the 3DGA and both IMUs, and between raters, was performed. Although validity and reliability of the lateral IMU was low, good validity and inter-rater reliability was found for the anterior IMU (Rater1: mean difference: -0.7 ± 2.1, p = 0.27; ICC = 0.83 and Rater2: mean difference: -0.4 ± 1.9, p = 0.46; ICC = 0.86).

The present study investigated the effect of data length on ENT½ and SPD and additionally applied these measures to stride length and stride speed intervals. First, stride times were collected from subjects during one hour of treadmill walking. ENT½ and SPD were calculated from a range of stride numbers between 250 and 2500. Secondly, stride times, stride lengths and stride speeds were collected from subjects during 16 min of treadmill walking. ENT½ and SPD were calculated from the stride times, stride lengths and stride speeds. The ENT½ values reached a plateau between 1000 and 2500 strides whereas the SPD increased linearly with the number of included strides. This suggests that ENT½ can be compared if 1000 strides or more are included, but only SPD obtained from same number of strides should be compared. The ENT½ and SPD of the stride times were significantly longer compared to that of the stride lengths and stride speeds. This indicates that the time dependency is greater in the motor control of stride time compared to that of stride lengths and stride speeds.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The investigation is focused on the center of the membrane where the stresses are maximal and equibiaxial. Second harmonic generation reveals an unexpected collagen rearrangement in the compact layer that is responsible for the structural integrity of the fetal membrane. The observed bundling and alignment of the collagen fibers indicate a deviation from the expected equibiaxial stress state. The statistical analysis of the fiber orientations provides information on two driving forces for collagen alignment: microscale flaws and macroscale deviation from the equibiaxial strain. As the pressure increases, the macroscale effect becomes dominant, and a high density of fibers that are aligned along a specific direction is observed. A model that explains these observations and relates them to the material properties is presented. The results of this study indicate that a temporal increase in intrauterine pressure or uterine cervix dilatation causes irreversible changes in collagen molecular connections that may lead to biological changes, such as the initiation of term and preterm labor.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Suspended-load backpacks have been shown to reduce dynamic peak forces acting on the body and lower an individual's metabolic cost during walking. However, little is known about the physiological and biomechanical effects of a suspended-load backpack on the human musculoskeletal system. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of different types of backpacks on metabolic cost, joint kinetics, gait kinematics, and muscle activity while individuals carried the same load of 15 kg at a walking speed of 5 km/h and running speed of 7 km/h on an instrumented treadmill. A group of six healthy participants participated in experiments in which two different backpacks were worn under three different conditions: suspended-load backpack working condition (SLB_ON), suspended-load backpack locking condition (SLB_OFF), and ordinary backpack condition (ORB). The results showed that carrying the backpack in the SLB_ON condition can reduce lower limb muscle activities and biological joint work while decreasing the metabolic cost by 15.25 ± 4.21% and 8.81 ± 2.46% during walking and 12.53 ± 2.39% and 6.99 ± 2.37% during running compared to carrying the backpack in the SLB_OFF and the ORB conditions, respectively. However, the SLB_ON condition may cause increased shoulder strain and dynamic stability and balance problems.

Most often, models are driven with segment motions calculated through optical tracking of markers adhered to the skin. One limitation of optical tracking is soft tissue artifact (STA), which occurs due to motion of the skin surface relative to the underlying skeleton. The purpose of this study was to quantify differences in musculoskeletal model outputs when tracking body segment positions with skin markers as compared to bony landmarks measured by direct imaging of bone motion with dual fluoroscopy (DF). Eleven asymptomatic participants with normally developed hip anatomy were imaged with DF during level treadmill walking at a self-selected speed. Hip joint kinematics and kinetics were generated using inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, static optimization and joint reaction force analysis. The effect of STA was assessed by comparing the difference in estimates from simulations based on skin marker positions (SM) versus virtual markers on bony landmarks from DF. While patterns were similar, STA caused underestimation of kinematics, range of motion (ROM), moments, and reaction forces at the hip, including flexion-extension ROM, maximum internal rotation joint moment and peak joint reaction force magnitude. Still, kinetic differences were relatively small, and thus they may not be relevant nor clinically meaningful.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Eight pre-operative Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty patients participated in this study while optical motion capture measured kinematics, specifically scapulothoracic angles and angular displacements, vs. humerothoracic elevation. The angle measurements were compared across the static calibration poses used to calculate them within-patient with One Dimensional Statistical Parametric Mapping paired t-tests and across-patients with a series of Sign Tests. The study uncovered patient-specificity in the effects of the Acromion Marker Cluster calibration pose on scapulothoracic angles and near linear offsets between the scapulothoracic upward rotation angles. The scapulothoracic upward rotation angular displacement measurements across calibration poses were within 5° of each other, suggesting nearly linear offsets between upward rotation angle measurements from each calibration pose. The Sign Tests revealed that using the Neutral calibration pose estimated significantly greater scapulothoracic protraction angles during arm elevation than did using the Hand to Back Pocket calibration pose (p = 0.02). Scapulothoracic protraction and posterior tilt measurements were near linear offsets between calibration poses only when humerothoracic elevation was less than 50°.

Clinical evidence of disc disorders later in life following endplate fracture suggests that the disc is also impacted by the fracture event. There is an abundance of evidence to indicate that loss of disc pressure at the time of fracture alters annulus fibrosus loading which could impact disc health long-term. However, little is known regarding the isolated impact of the rapid disc pressurization during the fracture event. This study sought to determine if rapid disc pressurization impacts mechanical properties of the annulus. Intervertebral discs of porcine cervical functional spine units (FSU) were pressurized via rapid injection of hydraulic fluid (standard motor oil). FSUs were subsequently grouped according to whether the pressurization resulted in endplate fracture ('fracture'; n = 9) or not ('non-fracture'; n = 13). Annular tensile properties and lamellar adhesion strength were quantified for both fractured and non-fractured samples. A third group was also examined in which FSUs did not undergo the pressurization protocol ('control'; n = 10). Annular tensile properties were not found to be statistically different between the three conditions (p > 0.05). Lamellar adhesion strength, in contrast, was found to be, on average, 53% lower in specimens which were pressurized compared to control, non-pressurized samples (p = 0.03). Further, no statistical differences in adhesion strength was found between fractured and non-fractured pressurized samples (p = 0.990) indicating that rapid pressurization , and not the presence of an endplate fracture, impacted the mechanical properties of the annulus. Decreased lamellar adhesion strength increases the potential of delamination, which can lead to disc disorders.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies have used the COM to calculate measures such as overstriding, vertical stiffness, and vertical oscillation. The COM is traditionally computed using the segmental analysis method, though this is expensive and time-consuming owing to the need for a full-body marker set. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the COM trajectory can be approximated by a single sacral marker during running. Seventy-one participants underwent a biomechanical running analysis on a treadmill utilizing a full-body marker set. Marker trajectories from the sacral marker and from the COM calculated using the segmental analysis method were compared over the entire gait cycle by computing intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and root-mean-square error. Paired t-tests were used to determine if the positions differed in mediolateral, anteroposterior, and vertical directions at three gait events (initial contact, midstance, and toe-off). The trajectories from the two methods exhibited a similar pattern in vertical and anteroposterior directions throughout the gait cycle, displaying strong correlations in these directions (ICC = 0.98 ± 0.01 and 0.83 ± 0.07). Our results suggest that a single sacral marker is a valid proxy for COM trajectory in vertical and anteroposterior directions at key events during the stance phase of running in a female recreational population. Researchers can therefore use a single sacral marker to estimate COM trajectory, rather than a full-body marker set, saving on both time and supplies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underpinning the reduction in external knee adduction moment (EKAM) in older adult women who wore this type of footwear through a randomized controlled trial. Fifty-six participants with medial compartment knee OA were equally allocated to either an intervention group (IG) that wore minimalist footwear (Moleca®) or to a control group (CG) that continued regular clinical treatment for OA for six months. The influence of lower limb joint kinematics and joint frontal moments, center of pressure displacement, and foot progression angle in predicting the reduction of EKAM were assessed after a six-month intervention. Surprisingly, none of the seven independent variables predicted the first peak EKAM in the multiple regression model for the IG. For the CG, the increase of one unit in the first peak of the hip adduction moment resulted in a 1.01 units increase in the first peak EKAM. Additionally, a one-unit reduction in the ankle eversion angle resulted in an increase of 0.16 units in the percent change in the first peak EKAM. Thus, wearing the Moleca® shoe for six months helped the participants keep a natural gait pattern without increasing the hip moment or the ankle inversion angle compared to the women who did not wear the Moleca® footwear.

While current clinical guidelines recommend surgical intervention for aneurysm diameter > 5.5 cm, high incidence of TAAD in patients below this diameter threshold indicates the pressing need for improved evidence-based risk prediction metrics. Construction of such metrics will require the knowledge of the biomechanical failure properties of the aortic wall tissue under biaxial loading conditions. We utilized a fiber-level finite element based structural model of the aortic tissue to quantify the relationship between aortic tissue strength and physiologically relevant biaxial stress state for nonaneurysmal and aneurysmal patient cohorts with tricuspid aortic valve phenotype. We found that the model predicted strength of the aortic tissue under physiologic biaxial loading conditions depends on the stress biaxiality ratio, defined by the ratio of the longitudinal and circumferential components of the tissue stress. We determined that predicted biaxial tissue strength is statistically similar to its uniaxial circumferential strength below biaxiality ratios of 0.68 and 0.69 for nonaneurysmal and aneurysmal cohorts, respectively. Beyond this biaxiality ratio, predicted biaxial strength for both cohorts reduced drastically to a magnitude statistically similar to its longitudinal strength. We identified fiber-level failure mechanisms operative under biaxial stress state governing aforementioned tissue failure behavior. These findings are an important first step towards the development of mechanism-based TAAD risk assessment metrics for early identification of high-risk patients.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To avoid further pain or injury, patients with NSCLBP seem to adopt a stiffer movement pattern during everyday living activities. However, it remains unknown how NSCLBP affects the lumbar lordosis angle (LLA) during repetitive activities such as walking or running. This pilot study therefore aimed at exploring possible NSCLBP-related alterations in LLAs during walking and running by focusing on discrete parameters as well as continuous data. Thirteen patients with NSCLBP and 20 healthy pain-free controls were enrolled and underwent a full-body movement analysis involving various everyday living activities such as standing, walking and running. LLAs were derived from markers placed on the spinous processes of the vertebrae L1-L5 and S1. Possible group differences in discrete (average and range of motion (ROM)) and continuous LLAs were analyzed descriptively using mean differences with confidence intervals ranging from 95% to 75%. Patients with NSCLBP indicated reduced average LLAs during standing, walking and running and a tendency for lower LLA-ROM during walking. Analyses of continuous data indicated the largest group differences occurring around 25% and 70% of the walking and 25% and 75% of the running cycle. Furthermore, patients indicated a reversed movement pattern during running, with increasing instead of a decreasing LLAs after foot strike. This study provides preliminary evidence that NSCLBP might affect LLAs during walking and running. These results can be used as a basis for future large-scale investigations involving hypothesis testing.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Video footage was collected of 449 head impacts experienced by 37 players over 33 games. Videos were analyzed using a reliable, structured questionnaire to classify: playing zone, location on ice, puck possession, direction of gaze, object striking the head, location of head impact, trajectory of colliding players, and penalties. Generalized Linear Models were used to compare response categories for the proportion of players experiencing at least one head impact, and the number of head impacts per player. The majority of events resulting in head impact involved contact with another player (93%). Head impacts occurred most often to players who did not have puck possession, who were checked along the boards in their offensive zone. Players were just as likely to experience head impact with an environmental object, as with an opposing player's body part. Glass-to-head impacts represented 30% of cases, four times as common as board-to-head impacts. Hand-to-head impacts accounted for 23% of cases, twice as common as shoulder- or elbow-to-head impacts. In 27% of events, there were two or more successive impacts to the head (e.g., contact with shoulder and then boards). Only 16% of head impacts which involved contact with another player resulted in infractions. Our results support the need for additional research on the benefits of stricter rule enforcement, and modifications to the stiffness of glass and padding of gloves, for reducing the frequency and severity of head impacts in ice hockey.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Opening loops bonded to the first and second maxillary molars on both sides were used to apply distracting forces of 0.28 N, 0.42 N and 0.56 N at the midpalatal suture for 7 and 14 days. Microcomputed tomography (MicroCT), histomorphometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis were performed to evaluate RME effectiveness, midpalatal suture remodeling, cell counting of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes and the expression of bone remodeling markers, respectively. All forces at the two different time points resulted in similar RME and enhanced of bone remodeling. Accordingly, increased number of osteoblasts and reduced chondrocytes counting and no difference in osteoclasts were seen after all RME protocols. RME yielded increased expression of bone remodeling markers as osteocalcin (Ocn), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein-1 (Dmp1), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), collagen type I Alpha 1 (Col1a1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (Rankl), osteoprotegerin (Opg), cathepsin K (Ctsk), matrix metalloproteinases 9 and 13 (Mmp9 and 13), transforming growth fator beta 1, 2 and 3 (Tgfb 1, Tgfb 2 and Tgfb3), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp-2), sclerostin (Sost), beta-catenin-like protein 1 (Ctnnbl) and Wnt signaling pathways 3, 3a and 5a (Wnt 3, Wnt 3a and Wnt 5a).

The mineral plates have been considered as one-dimensional bar elements embedded in the two-dimensional plane stress collagen matrix. The mineral phase is considered as linear elastic and a hyperelastic material model is adopted for the collagen phase. Further, the crack initiation and propagation in the collagen phase have been modeled using a damage plasticity approach. Different realizations of the arrangement of mineral plates have been generated to account for the associated geometrical uncertainties using an in-house MATLAB® code. Monte-Carlo type simulations have been performed on the different realizations of mineralized collagen fibril to predict its characteristic stress-strain response under tensile load. The characteristic strength of 3.64 GPa is obtained for mineralized collagen fibril using Weibull's analysis which is found to be in agreement with the molecular dynamics simulation data and numerical studies reported in the past.

Conditions such as osteoporosis and treatment with antiresorptive bisphosphonates can influence this remodeling process. In order to study microdamage accrual and repair in the context of osteoporosis and osteon structures, we set out to modify the rabbit forelimb fatigue model. New Zealand White rabbits (N = 43, 10 months old) received either ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgeries and were used for forelimb fatigue loading. OVX increased fluorochrome labeling of intracortical and periosteal bone of the ulna, without changes in bone mass. Monotonic and cyclic loading of the forelimb did not reveal any statistical differences between stiffness, ultimate force, or displacement to failure between sham and OVX rabbits. Two levels of fatigue loading, chosen to represent ""low"" and ""moderate"" fatigue (25% and 40% of total displacement to failure, respectively), were used on OVX forelimbs to examine microdamage creation. However, neither group showed increased damage burden as compared to non-loaded controls. Following fatigue loading rabbit ulnae had increased intracortical remodeling and periosteal lamellar bone formation in ""moderate"" fatigue limbs, although no basic multicellular units or microdamage-targeted remodeling was observed. In summary, we adapted the rabbit forelimb fatigue model to accommodate OVX animals. However, loading parameters that could induce repeatable microdamage burden were not identified. Thus, while increased intracortical remodeling and periosteal bone formation were induced by our fatigue loading regimen, this preliminary study did not establish conditions to allow future study of the interactions between microdamage accrual and repair.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unfortunately, this bending behavior has been barely investigated which limits the design of BMCVSs with optimal structures. Herein, six BMCVSs were designed and their bending process were simulated using finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the effects of the stent bridge connection type and structure on the bending behavior were systematically analyzed and an universal mathematical model was further established, in which the influence of the structure parameters of the stent bridge on the flexibility of stents was considered. After that, the bending mechanism of the high-stress zone of the bridge was investigated. Finally, the causes and effects of the self-contacting phenomenon as well as the inner-stent protrusion phenomenon in the bending state were analyzed theoretically, and corresponding solutions were proposed to optimize the design of stents. The numerical results show that the stents with the dislocation-line W-shaped unit have better flexibility than the other stents. The flexibility is positively correlated to the cube of the length of linear part and to the square of the curvature of curved part. The self-contacting phenomenon of the bridge during bending can constrain the formation of inner-stent protrusion, which can eliminate the negative effects of the implanted stents on the hemodynamics in blood vessels. This study is expected to provide practical guidance for the structural design of BMCVSs for clinical applications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty-four youth baseball players pitched fastballs in an indoor laboratory while motion capture and force plate data were collected. Horizontal GRF variables were extracted (peak GRF and GRF impulse) while EF was calculated by integrating magnitudes of mechanical powers transferred into and out of the pelvis, trunk, and arm segments via joint force power (JFP) and joint moment power (JMP) components. Peak propulsive GRF of the drive (back) leg correlated with EF into proximal segments, whereas peak braking GRF of the stride (lead) leg correlated with EF into distal segments. Furthermore, peak GRF of the drive leg and GRF impulse of both legs correlated with the JFP components of EF into the pelvis and trunk segments. In contrast, peak GRF and GRF impulse of the stride leg both correlated with the JMP components of EF into the arm segment. These results suggest that horizontal GRF impulse from the drive and stride leg contribute to EF between major segments of the lower and upper extremity. In addition, these results also suggest that propulsion kinetics of the drive leg play a role in transferring linear power via the pelvis and trunk segments in the throwing direction of the pitch, whereas braking kinetics of the stride leg play a role in creating rotational power that is transferred between the trunk and arm segment via the shoulder joint.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, little information is available on how the loss of distal degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the arm impact muscle force, thereby limiting our understanding of the mechanism by which these MSCs are manifesting. Knowledge of how a loss of DOFs may lead to MSCs can enable clinicians to provide more targeted guidance on how best to restore functional ability while addressing pain, and may serve as a tool for prescriptive decision-making when determining the impact of device selection on long-term clinical needs. 3D motion capture data were collected from 12 right-handed subjects with no upper limb disability using an 8-camera Vicon™ motion analysis system as they performed the targeted Box and Blocks test under normal and braced conditions to simulate a loss of DOFs in the wrist and fingers. Muscle force data were calculated using AnyBody Modeling Software™ for four different muscles: erector spinae, infraspinatus, deltoid, and trapezius. Linear mixed effects models were generated using the peak force data and mean force data for a given muscle fascicle.

Yet, there is a paucity of kinetic data for the hand-handhold interface during recovery from a ladder climbing perturbation. This study quantified the hand-rung forces utilized after ladder climbing perturbations and the factors (upper body strength, fall severity, reestablished foot placement) contributing to hand-rung force. A ladder rung was released under the foot of the participants to simulate a climbing misstep perturbation. Hand-rung forces after the perturbation were quantified from load cells connected to two ladder rungs. Mean peak hand-rung force magnitudes were found to range between 46% and 84% of the climber's body weight. These magnitudes approached and, in some cases, exceeded individuals' grasping capacity. Individual upper body strength was not found to consistently contribute to hand-rung force, but increased hand-rung force was clearly linked with greater fall severity after an ascending perturbation. Individuals that reestablished foot placement after an ascending perturbation utilized lower hand-rung forces. Therefore, this study suggests hand-rung force to be dependent on circumstances of the falling event (fall severity, reestablished foot placement) as opposed to the climber's capability of producing upper body force. This knowledge highlights the importance of handhold and ladder designs for arresting a falling event, and is critical to inform ladder fall interventions such as designing handholds that resist high forces and permitting steps that enable reestablished foot placement.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This challenge is of paramount importance given the need to deduce the orientation of the bony anatomy to estimate joint angles. This paper systematically surveys a large number (N = 112) of studies from 2000 to 2018 that employ four broad categories of methods to address this challenge across a range of body segments and joints. We categorize these methods as: (1) Assumed Alignment methods, (2) Functional Alignment methods, (3) Model Based methods, and (4) Augmented Data methods. Assumed Alignment methods, which are simple and commonly used, require the researcher to visually align the IMU sense axes with the underlying anatomical axes. Functional Alignment methods, also commonly used, relax the need for visual alignment but require the subject to complete prescribed movements. Model Based methods further relax the need for prescribed movements but instead assume a model for the joint. Finally, Augmented Data methods shed all of the above assumptions, but require data from additional sensors. Significantly different estimates of the underlying anatomical axes arise both across and within these categories, and to a degree that renders it difficult, if not impossible, to compare results across studies. Consequently, a significant future need remains for creating and adopting a standard for defining anatomical axes via inertial motion capture to fully realize this technology's potential for biomechanical studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Studies published so far are based on data generated by human rowers, inevitably adding biological variability without any option to clamp particular variables like stroke structure or force. To this end, we developed a test rig for rowing ergometers aiming to generate valid and reliable stroke structures (i.e. force-displacement curves). Briefly, the rig consists out of a frame connected to the ergometer. The handlebar of the rowing ergometer is attached to a sledge that can be displaced on a linear drive by a motor that is controlled by torque curves which are derived from elite rowers. A load cell between handlebar and chain and an incremental linear transducer allow criterion measures of force and distance of displacement to calculate mechanical power output. To evaluate the validity of the machine generated force-displacement curves, three different stroke structures were compared to the respective human reference curves. To evaluate reliability, series of 50 consecutive strokes were performed for 10 times. Validity of the curves was indicated by small differences in stroke-force, -distance, and -work (≤ |-7.8|%) between machine generated and human generated curves. Mean power output of the test series was 445 ± 1 W with a coefficient of variation of 0.53% between series.

Twenty young adults aged 20-40 years and eighteen healthy elderly people aged ≥ 65 years old were recruited. The subjects performed STS with and without using the three types of bars. Bar reaction force (BRF) and maximum power (MP) defined as the maximal product calculated by multiplying the GRF and the velocity of the center of mass in each direction were measured using three-dimensional motion analysis, two load sensors of GB, and four force plates. The use of the shelf bar generated a significantly larger BRF in the vertical direction than the other bars (p < 0.05) and lower MP in the vertical direction than the horizontal bar (p < 0.05) and no bar (p < 0.05). In the younger subjects, only the use of the vertical bar generated a significantly larger BRF (p < 0.05) and negative MP (p < 0.05) in the forward direction than those in elderly subjects. The use of the shelf bar may assist the decreased MP in the vertical direction during STS in elderly people, resulting in decrease of failed STS in daily living. In contrast, the use of the vertical bar in the elderly may not generate sufficient BRF in the forward direction because of lack of eccentric control in the whole body in the forward direction during STS.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A previous modification to the three-compartment controller (3CC) fatigue model incorporated a rest recovery multiplier (3CC-r model) to represent augmented blood flow to muscle during rest intervals (Looft et al., 2018). A rest recovery value of r = 15 was optimal for ankle, knee, and elbow joint regions, whereas r = 30 was better for hand/grip muscles. However, shoulder torque decline data was unavailable in the literature for comparison. Thus, the purpose of this study was to collect fatigue data for two different intermittent, isometric shoulder flexion fatiguing tasks and assess the 3CC-r model with r = 15 or 30 compared to the original 3CC model. Twenty healthy participants (9 M) completed two fatigue tasks: 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with 50% duty cycle (DC) and 70% MVC with 70% DC. MVCs were assessed at discrete time points (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min) until endurance time (MET). Mean observed percent torque decline (%TD) for the two tasks were compared to three model estimates: 3CC-r (using r = 15 and r = 30) and 3CC. Using these data, we confirmed that the addition of a rest multiplier (r = 15 somewhat better than r = 30) substantially improved predictions of shoulder fatigue using a previously validated analytical fatigue model (3CC).

Interventions to increase joint powers often require labs with motion capture and force treadmill technology. Translating these interventions out of the lab requires identifying portable measures that track (i.e., strongly correlate with) changes in joint powers. The purpose of this study was to determine if kinematics collected using inertial measurement units (IMUs) correlate with propulsive joint powers calculated using inverse dynamics. We collected data simultaneously with motion capture, force plates, and IMU sensors as young and older adults walked at varying speeds overground in a laboratory. Hip, knee, and ankle joint powers were calculated using inverse dynamics and positive peaks in the second half of stance were identified as the propulsive powers of interest. Raw IMU gyroscope data were oriented to a functional medial-lateral axis and peaks in the second half of stance were identified for segment (thigh, shank, foot) and joint (hip, knee, ankle) angular velocities. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between peak joint powers and peak angular velocities. We identified significant (all p < 0.001) correlations between hip joint power and hip and thigh angular velocities (r = 0.80-0.83) and between ankle joint power and ankle, shank, and foot angular velocities (r = 0.77-0.89).

Digital image correlation (DIC) has recently been adopted to provide full-field strain measurements during mechanical testing of femurs. However, it has typically been used to measure strains on the anterior side of the femur, whereas in both single-leg-stance and sideways fall loading conditions, the highest deformations result on the medial and lateral sides of the femoral neck. The goal of this study was to measure full-field deformations simultaneously on the medial and lateral side of the femoral neck in a configuration resembling a fall to the side. Twelve female cadaver femurs were prepared for DIC measurements and tested in sideways fall at 5 mm/s displacement rate. Two pairs of cameras recorded the medial and lateral side of the femoral neck, and deformations were calculated using DIC. The samples exhibited a two-stage failure: first, a compressive collapse on the superolateral side of the femoral neck in conjunction with peak force, followed by complete femoral neck fracture at the force drop following the post-elastic phase. DIC measurements corroborated this observation by reporting no tensile strains above yield limit for the medial side of the neck up to peak force. DIC measurements registered onto the bone micro-architecture showed strain localizations in proximity of cortical pores due to, for instance, blood vessels. This could explain previously reported discrepancies between simulations and experiments in regions rich with large pores, like the superolateral femoral neck.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Eighty-eight fresh temporal muscle samples from 69 human cadavers (age range 4 months - 94 years) were investigated in a quasi-static tensile setup. For comparative reasons, 20 age-matched human temporal muscle fascia and scalp samples were tested in the same manner as the temporal muscle. Human temporal muscle showed an elastic modulus of 1.58 ± 0.64 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 0.26 ± 0.11 MPa and a strain at maximum force of 26.21 ± 12.48%.

All passive load-deformation parameters of the human temporal muscle differed from temporal muscle fascia and scalp except for the strain at maximum force of the temporal muscle and scalp. Significantly different load-deformation properties of the human temporal muscle from temporal muscle fascia and scalp indicate the need for a separate simulation of these soft tissue layers in computational head models to reflect lifelike conditions.

Ankle torque and resulting frequency response functions, which describes the dynamics of the stabilizing mechanism, were calculated by both including and excluding horizontal ground reaction forces. Results showed that the joint stiffness of an inverted pendulum estimated using system identification is comparable to the joint stiffness estimated by a regression method. Secondly, within the induced body sway angles, the ankle torque and frequency response function of the joint dynamics calculated by both including and excluding horizontal ground reaction forces are similar. Therefore, the horizontal ground reaction forces play a minor role in calculating the ankle torque and frequency response function of the dynamics of the stabilizing mechanism and can thus be omitted.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Hence, a wave speed sensor could be used to track tendon loading during movement. However, adjacent soft tissues and varying joint postures may affect the wave speed-load relationship for intact tendons. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the proportional relationship between squared wave speed and stress holds for in situ cadaveric Achilles tendons, to evaluate whether this relationship is affected by joint angle, and to assess potential calibration techniques. Achilles tendon wave speed and loading were simultaneously measured during cadaveric simulations of gait and isometric contractions performed in a robotic gait simulator. Squared wave speed and axial stress were highly correlated during isometric contraction at all ankle postures (R2avg = 0.98) and during simulations of gait (R2avg = 0.92). Ankle plantarflexion angle did not have a consistent effect on the constant of proportionality (p = 0.217), but there was a significant specimen-angle interaction effect (p < 0.001). Wave speed-based predictions of tendon stress were most accurate (average RMS error = 11% of maximum stress) when calibrating to isometric contractions performed in a dorsiflexed posture that resembled the posture at peak Achilles loading during gait. The results presented here show that the linear relationship between tendon stress and squared shear wave speed holds for a case resembling in vivo conditions, and that calibration during an isometric task can yield accurate predictions of tendon loading during a functional task.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Assumptions of idealized lesion geometry made in previous finite element (FE) studies of metastatic disease in the proximal femur may not sufficiently capture effects of local stress/strain concentrations on predicted failure strength. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a FE failure model of the proximal femur incorporating artificial defects representative of physiologic metastatic disease. Data from 11 cadaveric femur specimens were randomly divided into either a training set (n = 5) or a test set (n = 6). Clinically representative artificial defects were created, and the femurs were loaded to failure under offset torsion. Voxel-based FE models replicating the experimental setup were created from the training set pre-fracture computed tomography data. Failure loads from the linear model with maximum principal strain failure criterion correlated best with the experimental data (R2 = 0.86, p = 0.024). The developed model was found to be reliable when applied to the test dataset with a relatively low RMSE of 46.9 N, mean absolute percent error of 12.7 ± 17.1%, and cross-validation R2 = 0.88 (p < 0.001). Models simulating realistic lesion geometry explained an additional 26% of the variance in experimental failure load compared to idealized lesion models (R2 = 0.62, p = 0.062).

The back squat is simultaneously an open and closed kinetic chain movement that requires coordination of the entire body for successful completion of the lift. Therefore, this study aimed to examine coordination of the thigh and shank, trunk and thigh, and the hip and knee during the concentric phase of maximum, supra-maximum (at 105% max), and sub-maximum (at 80% max) back squats. Fourteen resistance trained adults participated in this study. Maximum back squat loads were determined using a previously determined progressive load protocol. Motion capture of the trunk and lower extremities and ground reaction force data were recorded during all squats. Angle-angle plots and modified vector coding were performed to analyze segment and joint coupling angles and knee-hip moments. Overall, the concentric phase of back squats depict a transition from early knee dominance to hip dominance as the system ascends. Interestingly, all squats presented with coupling of thigh-rising and trunk-falling. Based on the angle-angle plots and the modified vector coding results, the prolonged coupling of trunk falling and thigh rising likely resulted in too large of a moment arm for the external load for the participants to overcome during Supramax conditions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In order to make the wear simulation more realistic, random variation was added for the first time to the motion and load control signals of a hip joint simulator. For this purpose and for the simulation of various daily activities, computer-controlled, servo-electric drives were mounted on a biaxial hip simulator frame and successfully introduced. Random variation did not result in a statistically significant difference in the wear factor of large diameter VEXLPE liners compared with fixed sinusoidal waveforms. However, level walking according to biomechanical literature surprisingly resulted in a 134 per cent higher, and jogging in a 57 per cent lower wear factor compared with the fixed sinusoidal waveforms. These wear phenomena were likely to be caused by a variation in the lubrication conditions and frictional heating. Simplified motion waveforms may result in an underestimation of wear in walking.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study presents an investigation of morphological and mechanical properties of iliofemoral (n = 8) and carotid (n = 22) atherosclerotic plaque constituents. μCT analysis is used characterize the content and morphology of calcifications in excised plaques. Calcified particles contribute a significant proportion of the average plaque volume (7.6% carotid; 19.1% iliofemoral), and on average over 50% of this volume (53.7 ± 18.6% carotid; 61.7 ± 15% iliofemoral) is accounted for by the largest individual particle found in the plaque. Fibrous tissue and calcifications were isolated for mechanical testing. Unconfined compression testing of isolated calcifications uncovered viscoelastic behavior. Tensile stress relaxation uncovered viscoelastic behavior in fibrous atherosclerotic samples. Iliofemoral fibrous samples were found to be statistically significantly stiffer (*p < 0.05) than carotid fibrous samples. Results show isolated calcifications are approximately two orders of magnitude stiffer than non-calcified fibrous tissue.

The main aim of the study was to designate, depending on the food: (1) the work of a single muscle (i.e. masseter, medial pterygoid, temporalis), and (2) the energy balance of mandibular elevator muscles based on the dynamic patterns of muscles. In turn, the indirect goal was to determine: (1) the muscle contraction, and (2) the average muscle contraction velocity based on the specified kinematic parameters, i.e. incisal biting velocity and incisal biting time. A hybrid model, consisting of a phenomenological model of the masticatory system and a behavioural model of incisal biting, was used in the calculations. The phenomenological model was based on an anatomically and physiologically normal mandible and healthy muscles, while the behavioural model was represented by the dynamic patterns of food. Calculations showed that muscle force is an important, but not the only, parameter that enables the quantitative and qualitative assessment of the functioning of the mandibular elevator muscles during symmetric incisal biting. Based on the obtained results, it can be stated that the dynamic patterns of muscles are a very important parameter, because on their basis, among others, muscle contraction, contraction time, work, and energy can be determined. The conducted calculations and analyses showed that the above-mentioned parameters depend on the mechanical properties of food (the dynamic patterns of food).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Studies quantifying joint work and its inter-joint proportions in cutting have not accounted for work done by the foot, even though this segment has been shown to be an important source of mechanical work in walking, running, and landing. The aims of this study were to: (1) quantify the magnitude of foot work performed and provide a more precise account of percentage joint work during cutting, and (2) examine the effect, a lack of anticipation had on these variables. Three-dimensional motion capture with forceplates were used to assess the cutting behaviour of 17 healthy participants. All participants performed a 45° cut with an approach speed of 4 m/s. Hip, knee, and ankle joint work were calculated using inverse dynamics; whilst foot work was quantified using the Unified-Deformable foot method. The foot contributed up to 12.45% and 3.09% of total limb negative and positive work, respectively. Unanticipated cutting significantly reduced ankle positive work (-0.09 J/kg [95% CI -0.13 to -0.06], P < 0.001) and significantly reduced percentage ankle positive work (-2.17% [95% CI -3.47 to -0.86], P = 0.001). The foot performs as much negative work as the hip but had only a minor contribution to positive work during cutting. Anticipation had a negligible influence on joint work and its inter-joint proportions. The foot should not be neglected in understanding whole-body dynamics during cutting, with greater understanding of its function potentially useful for informing athletic footwear design and cutting technique modification.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Marker position accuracy is largely dependent on the optical characteristics of the camera system and algorithms implemented in the tracking software. In 1999, Richards critically reviewed multiple camera systems and each of their ability to generate the same marker coordinate positions under different field tests. Field tests were designed utilizing what became to be known as the Standard Assessment of Motion System Accuracy (SAMSA) device. The SAMSA test results indicated that some systems outperformed others and accuracy varied depending on the test. In the subsequent 20 years, motion capture technology has significantly improved. Therefore, we aimed to replicate the tests from 1999 using current, higher-resolution motion capture systems and current calibration techniques. Reference marker distances were established utilizing a FaroArm 3D digitizer (FARO technologies). The modern cameras field test performance showed nearly a three-fold improvement in agreement with the reference measure compared to their 1999 predecessors. No systems' absolute marker distance measured greater than 0.5 mm from the FaroArm measurement and no systems' maximum error exceeded 1.0 mm. Given the consistency in accuracy reported by all the systems included in the current assessment, it's reasonable to assume that the current systems would eliminate errors associated with system hardware/software as an obstacle to sharing data between laboratories.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fourteen participants walked on a pathway with a 16-cm curb located in the middle. They walked without a load or asymmetrically carrying a load corresponding to 7% of their body mass. The weight was placed in two different bags (with and without strap) and carried by the dominant and non-dominant hands. The upper limb coordination analysis showed that the anti-phase pattern between right and left shoulder reduced considerably due to the almost motionless shoulder of the side carrying the load. The spatial-temporal walking parameters and curb negotiation variables were unaffected by load carriage. The margin of stability (MoS) was unchanged by load transportation in the AP direction. In the ML direction, taking the bag on the same side of the foot contacting the floor increased the MoS; however, when the load was incorporated into the COM model, the MoS did not differ anymore from the control condition. The changes in interlimb coordination reflected a strategy to prevent unexpected movements of the bag that could threaten body stability. Healthy older adults were able to predict the consequences of carrying a load and kept the MoS constant. They compensated for the disturbance caused by the transport of a relatively moderate load and performed the descending curb task successfully.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Dynamic gait stability has been identified as a key risk factor of falls. The development of effective interventions for preventing falls requires a sound understanding of how MS affects dynamic gait stability. The purpose of the study was to compare dynamic gait stability within the framework of Feasible Stability Region between people with and without MS during level walking at a self-selected speed. Twenty adults with MS and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were recruited. Dynamic gait stability at touchdown and liftoff on both the strong and weak sides was assessed as the primary outcome measurement. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, including step times, step length, step frequency, and foot landing angle, were determined as explanatory variables. People with MS exhibited lower stability at both gait events bilaterally than their healthy counterparts. The lower stability was mainly attributable to the slower gait speed in MS than in the healthy control. To compensate for the dynamic gait stability deficit resulting from the slow gait speed, individuals with MS adopted a short step length to shift the center of mass motion state closer to the feasible stability region. For people with MS, the stability value was higher on the weak side than on the strong side at touchdown, but not liftoff. The findings from this study could provide insight into the impact of MS on the control of dynamic gait stability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Systematic searches of CINHAL, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and SPORTDiscus databases were run. All included studies had presented biomechanical variables pre- and post-surgery for the same participants. Articles were categorised by the analysed movement, and effect sizes were calculated. Fifty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data on gait (n = 31), balance (n = 12), joint position sense (n = 5), stair ambulation (n = 4), pivoting (n = 6), and landing (n = 5). Measures of balance performance and joint position sense showed improvements from pre- to post-surgery. Changes in joint kinematics were inconsistent between studies, however increased knee flexion excursion, and reduced tibial anterior translation and internal rotation post reconstruction were identified. Joint kinetics reduced in magnitude in the early stages after surgery (≤5 weeks), then increased later in recovery (≥24 weeks). Risk of bias assessment identified most articles had a moderate or high risk (low = 5; moderate = 21; high = 11) resulting from participant retention and surgical intervention differences. The results of the review identified that although lower limb biomechanics did alter following reconstruction, few variables provided consistent results across studies and tasks. The low methodological quality of some articles may have contributed to these inconsistent findings. Alternatively, differences across studies may have resulted from individual coping strategies of participants that have previously been suggested to be present before reconstructive surgery, and future research should look to explore individual coping strategies to ACL reconstruction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although recent efforts have improved understanding of the mechanics and control of stepping behaviors, the double support phase during stepping is understudied. Therefore, we quantified the stability of the resultant forces and moments acting on the body during this phase. These quantities determine the movement of the body, and therefore, their stability is essential for successful stepping behavior. We measured the ground reaction variables (GRVs) under both feet as healthy young (n = 10) and older adults (n = 10) stepped up and down a curb. We employed the uncontrolled manifold method to evaluate the hypotheses that the GRVs covary to stabilize the resultant force and moment in the three coordinate directions. Robust stabilization of the resultant forces and moments was observed while stepping up. However, while stepping down, the stability of the resultant moment was prioritized over that of the resultant forces in the vertical and the anterior-posterior directions, and the stability of the resultant medio-lateral force was prioritized over that of the resultant anterior-posterior force. The salience of stabilizing whole-body angular momentum and medio-lateral motion during locomotion is well known, but their prioritization during adaptive gait is a novel result and is possibly related to the higher likelihood of falling during descent (versus ascent). Finally, contrary to our expectations, we observed no age differences in our stability indices, indicating that healthy aging does not diminish the stability of the resultant forces and moments.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In inverse dynamics models, no single parameter could be attributed to simulate this force behaviour accordingly. The aim of this work is to implement kinematic, kinetic and muscle model modifications to an existing model of the shoulder (AnyBody™) and assess their single and combined effects during abduction up to 140° humeral elevation. The kinematics and the EMG activity of 10 test subjects were measured during humeral abduction. Six modifications were implemented in the model: alternative wrapping of the virtual deltoid muscle elements, utilization of a three element Hill model, strength scaling, motion capture driven clavicle elevation/protraction, translation of the GH joint in dependency of the acting forces and an alteration of the scapula/clavicle rhythm. From the six modifications, 16 different combinations were considered. Parameter combinations with the Hill model changed the resultant GH joint reaction force and led to an increase in force during abduction of the humerus above 90°. Under the premise of muscle activities and forces within the GH joint rising after 90° of humeral abduction, we propose that the Hill type muscle model is a crucial parameter for accurately modelling the shoulder. Furthermore, the outcome of this study indicates that the Hill model induces the co-contraction of the muscles of the shoulder without the need of an additional stability criterion for an inverse dynamics approach.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Data from participants with (n = 28) and without (n = 68) knee OA were used. All participants underwent gait analysis during walking at a self-selected pace. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength were measured at 60°/s and 120°/s. Varus thrust was measured using peak knee adduction velocity and knee adduction excursion during the first half of stance. Multiple linear regression was used to examine relationships between strength and varus thrust in the two groups separately while adjusting for age, sex, walking speed, and static alignment. In those with knee OA, knee extensor (Model R2 = 27.0%) and flexor torque (Model R2 = 28.5%) at 60°/s were negatively associated with peak adduction velocity. No other associations were seen between strength and varus thrust measures in the OA group. No associations were seen in the control group.

The main objectives at the primary level were to test intra-session reliability of mechanical parameters for ten equidistant FW loads, and at the secondary level, to test reliability and validity of the F-v relationship outcome measures in case any possible reduction in used loads and number of loads - compared to the 10-load method as a reference - is administered. Twenty-six subjects performed two sets of five squats with FW loads in the range 0.025-0.25 kg∙m2. Averaging six consecutive repetitions obtained ICC2.k > 0.9 for mean force and mean velocity results. Consecutively averaged parameters at the primary level showed excellent inter-set reliability (ICC2.1 > 0.9). The inverse F-v relationship was strong (R2 = 0.96). At the secondary level, Bland-Altman statistics showed decreasing bias and limits of agreement in combination with more loads. Theoretical maximal force and power showed smaller bias as F-v slope and theoretical maximal velocity for three loads or more. Four loads (0.025, 0.075, 0.225 and 0.25 kg∙m2) lowered bias to a 5% in relation to the reference F-v slope. In conclusion, six repetitions are required to obtain trustworthy force and velocity results.

This research presented the first exoskeleton-human musculoskeletal model to estimate upper extremity biomechanics, driven by 3D motion data of persons with complete SCI walking with an exoskeleton and crutch assistance. Forearm crutches instrumented with strain gauges, force plates, and a 3D motion capture system were used to collect kinematic and kinetic data from five persons with complete SCI while walking with the ARKE exoskeleton. Model output estimated participant upper extremity kinematics, kinetics, and crutch forces. Compared to inverse dynamic biomechanical crutch model studies of persons with incomplete SCI, exoskeleton users walked with more anterior trunk tilt and twice the shoulder flexion angle. Anterior tilt increased forces and moments at the crutch, shoulder, and elbow. Crutch floor contact periods were 30-40% longer, resulting in upper extremity joint impulses 5 to 12 times greater than previously reported. Reducing UE joint loading is important to reduce overuse injuries associated with ambulatory assistive devices.

The computed muscle control (CMC) algorithm computes a set of muscle excitations for a movement using proportional-derivative control. However, errors between experimental and simulated kinematics may cause rapid movements. Herein, we propose a novel algorithm, i.e., hybrid computed muscle control (HCMC), which uses a hybrid of numerical integration and optimization to compute muscle excitation patterns that accurately track kinematics, even for rapid movements. We compared the muscle excitation patterns and accuracies of the kinematics simulated by HCMC and CMC using synthetic and experimental data. Two simple musculoskeletal models were used. The synthetic data were generated for three repetitive movements from the rest position to the flexed position (the hip, knee, and ankle underwent 10°, 20°, and 10° plantar flexion, respectively) and back to the rest position for various times. Experimental data were obtained for a subject running at 220 steps/min. The maximum errors in all kinematics calculated using the HCMC algorithm were extremely lower than those calculated using CMC algorithm (HCMC: 0.04-0.07° [synthetic data] and 0.00-0.03° [experimental data]; CMC: 1.04-2.41° [synthetic data] and 0.48-2.50 [experimental data]). For rapid movements, muscle excitations estimated using HCMC occurred early and without delay than those estimated using CMC. The HCMC algorithm can provide muscle excitation patterns that accurately track kinematics and may be useful for perturbation studies using forward dynamic simulation of joints characterized by a low range of motion during rapid movements.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The SLP portion II is composed of regular chitin micro-strips that non-uniformly arranged in its transverse plane. However, it is still unknown whether the natural arrangement of micro-strips affects the power amplification of the SLP cuticle. To address this, SLP portion II samples of adult locusts were mechanically tested along three orthogonal directions, corresponding to the length, width, and thickness axes of the micro-strips, respectively. Four different arrangements of micro-strips in the portion II were compared using finite element method. It was found that the micro-strip set of the portion II is orthotropic elastic and its elastic modulus is maximal in the length axis of the micro-strip. The inclusion of the micro-strips offers more strain energy than the isotropic portion II (without micro-strips). Compared to the horizontally- and vertically-arrangements of the micro-strips, their natural arrangement does not affect the strain energy but reduces the in-plane shear strain in the portion II. This research helps us deeply understand the power amplification mechanism of locusts and may guide optimization of catapult device design in bioinspired robots.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nineteen females and 18 males were evaluated. Upper arm elevation, upper back, head and neck forward flexion postures were recorded using digital inclinometers. The first and the last cycles of the task were considered as pre- and post-fatigue periods, respectively. For both periods, Amplitude Probability Distribution Function (APDF) was calculated for 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles, as well as the angular ranges between the 5th and 95th percentiles (APDF5-95 range). The APDF5-95 range for upper arm elevation was higher with fatigue, but with a higher increase for males. After fatigue, there was also a decrease in the upper arm elevation, with a larger decrease in males for the 10th and 50th percentiles. For head and neck, females showed higher APDF5-95 ranges than males, regardless of the task period evaluated. After muscle fatigue, males adopted more neutral postures of the upper arm than females. Furthermore, females showed more non-neutral postures for head and neck. These findings suggest that the kinematic strategies adopted by females and males during a simulated work task are different and may predispose females to a higher risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In-silico methods could be a useful tool to improve the design stage and preoperative planning; however, numerical modeling of braided structures is not trivial. The geometries are often challenging, and a parametric representation is not always easily achieved. Moreover, in the literature, different options have been proposed to handle the contact among the wires, but an extensive comparison of these modeling techniques is missing.In this work, both the geometry and contact issues are discussed. Firstly, an effective strategy based on parametric equations to draw complex braided geometries is illustrated and exploited to build three beam meshes resembling commercial devices. Secondly, three finite element simulations (bending, crimping and confined release) were carried out to compare simplified contact techniques involving connector elements with the more realistic but computationally expensive option based on the general contact algorithm, which has already been validated in the literature through comparisons with experimental results. Both local (stress distribution) and global quantities (forces/displacements) were analyzed.The results obtained using the connectors are significantly affected by wire interpenetrations and over-constraint.The percentage errors reached considerably high values, exceeding 100% in the confined release test and 50% in the remaining cases study. Moreover, the errors do not show uniform trends but vary according to the stent geometry, boundary conditions, connector type and investigated entity, suggesting that it is not possible to replace the use of the general contact algorithm with simplified approaches.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Statistical shape models can accurately predict bone geometry and have the potential to improve the repeatability of clinical gait analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine if using a shape model to scale segment length and joint centre locations would improve repeatability of kinematic and kinetic gait data, compared to linear scaling methods. Five participants completed a motion capture experiment, including a standing static trial and walking at a self-selected speed. Anatomical landmarks from the static trial were used by five experienced researchers to generate kinematic models using two methods; (1) linear scaling in OpenSim, and (2) shape-model scaling using our 'MAP Client' scale tool. The resulting models were used to perform an inverse kinematic and inverse dynamic analysis on the walking trials, and variation between researchers was analysed by comparing outputs from the same motion capture trial using different models. Higher variability between researchers was observed in joint angles (P < 0.001), joint moments (P < 0.005), and joint powers (P < 0.005) when using linear scaling, compared to shape-model scaling. Variation was at least three times as large for linearly-scaled models compared to shape-model scaled models. We have identified that linear scaling can lead to substantial variability in gait data across researchers, even with the same experimental data. Using a shape model to scale musculoskeletal models results in repeatable kinematic and kinetic gait data.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Computational methods become attractive to estimate primary stability from clinical CT images, but implicit finite element analysis of implant press-fit faces convergence issues due to contact and highly distorted elements. This study aims to develop and validate an explicit finite element method to simulate the insertion and primary stability of a rigid implant in a deformable bone while accounting for damage occurring at the bone-implant interface. Accordingly, a press-fit experiment of a conical implant into predrilled bovine trabecular bone was designed and realized for six samples. A displacement-driven cyclic protocol was used to quantify the reaction force and stiffness of the bone-implant system. Homogenized finite element analyses of the experiments were performed by modeling contact with friction and converting an existing constitutive model with elasto-plasticity and damage of bone tissue to be applicable to an explicit time integration scheme where highly distorted elements get deleted. The computed reaction forces and unloading stiffnesses showed high correlations (R2 = 0.95 and R2 = 0.94) with the experiment. Friction between bone and implant exhibited a strong influence on both reaction force and stiffness. In conclusion, the developed explicit finite element approach with frictional contact and element deletion accounts properly for bone damage during press-fit and will help optimizing dental or orthopedic implant design towards maximal primary stability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study aims to compare those metrics and reduction approaches based on descriptive and high order statistics. Data were obtained from 147 young healthy subjects wearing inertial measurement units at their wrist or ankle during standing, walking and running, labeled as light, medium or vigorous activities. The research question was, first, if those metrics allowed differentiating between light, moderate, and vigorous physical activities, and, secondly, what was the relationship with the metabolic equivalent of the task performed. The results showed that each metric differentiated the level of activity and presented a high correlation with the metabolic equivalent of the task. However, each metric and data reduction approach demonstrated its specific statistical characteristics related to the localization of the sensors.

Experiments were conducted in physiological buffered saline (PBS) or mature bovine synovial fluid (SF). A total of 63 samples were tested, of which 47 exhibited wear damage due to delamination of the cartilage surface initiated in the middle zone, with no evidence of abrasive wear. There was no difference between the friction coefficient of damaged and undamaged samples, showing that delamination wear occurs even when friction remains low under a migrating contact area configuration. No difference was observed in the onset of damage or in the friction coefficient between samples tested in PBS or SF. The onset of damage occurred earlier when testing cartilage against glass versus cartilage against cartilage, supporting the hypothesis that delamination occurs due to fatigue failure of the collagen in the middle zone, since stiffer glass produces higher strains and tensile stresses under comparable loads. The findings of this study are novel because they establish that delamination of the articular surface, starting in the middle zone, may represent a primary mechanism of failure. Based on preliminary data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that delamination wear via subsurface fatigue failure is similarly the primary mechanism of human cartilage wear under normal loading conditions, albeit requiring far more cycles of loading than in immature bovine cartilage.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

There are relatively few studies providing methods for quantifying the mechanical properties of skin and fat in the plantar tissue of diabetic patients. Previous studies used linear or non-linear single layer deformable models or linear multi-layer models. This study aimed to investigate the mechanical properties of plantar soft tissue using multi-layer, non-linear models to estimate more accurate mechanical properties in the plantar tissues of diabetic patients. Ten healthy young (HY) subjects, ten healthy old (HO) subjects, and ten old diabetic patients (DB) volunteered for the study. Indentation tests were performed at two sites in the heel. The subjects underwent computed tomography (CT) to measure the respective thicknesses of the skin and fat at the indentation sites. Subject-specific finite element models were created to estimate the parameters of the first-order Ogden forms of the skin and fat. The initial shear modulus for the fat layer μF in DB, HO, and HY were 4.68 MPa (±0.87), 2.71 MPa (±1.25), and 2.27 MPa (±0.87), respectively. The initial shear modulus for the skin layer (μS) in DB, HO, and HY were 5.86 MPa (±2.51), 7.05 MPa (±1.94), and 14.58 MPa (±1.98), respectively. The DB had stiffer fat tissue than the normal subjects in the same age group but had the same soft skin. These aspects can cause different mechanical stress conditions in a diabetic foot than in a normal foot under the same mechanical loading, making the diabetic foot vulnerable to the initiation of mechanical breakdowns such as ulcers.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Peak knee flexion and abduction angle, knee flexion and ab/adduction range of motion (ROM), peak vertical and posterior ground reaction force (GRF), peak internal knee extension and knee adduction moment were computed for the dominant limb during the first landing of both tasks. A two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of and interactions between sex (men vs women) and task (SJ vs DVJ) for each outcome. There was an interaction for peak vertical GRF (p = 0.024), knee flexion ROM (p = 0.027), knee ab/adduction ROM (p = 0.047), and peak knee flexion (p = 0.034) and adduction (p = 0.012) moment. The SJ resulted in smaller vertical GRFs, larger posterior GRFs, and larger peak internal knee adduction moments relative to the DVJ (all p < 0.002). Women landed with larger peak knee abduction angles, larger internal knee adduction moments, and smaller knee extension moments relative to men (p = 0.001-0.026). Overall, as the SJ resulted in larger posterior GRFs and internal knee adduction moments, this task produced movements which resemble most anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and are risk factors for ACL injuries. As the SJ produced more sex-based differences, it may be better suited than the DVJ for ACL injury risk screening.

The lumbar FCL is collagenous, with collagen fibers aligned primarily bone-to-bone (medial-lateral) and experiences significant shear, especially during spinal flexion and extension. We characterized the mechanical response of the lumbar FCL to in-plane shear, and we evaluated that response in the context of the fiber architecture. In-plane shear tests with both positive and negative shear (i.e., corresponding to flexion and to extension) were performed on eight cadaveric human L4-L5 FCLs. Our most striking observation was subject-dependent asymmetry in the response. All samples showed a toe region of low stiffness, transitioning to greater stiffness at higher strains, for both shear directions. Different samples showed profoundly different transition strains, with some samples stiffening more rapidly in positive shear and some in negative shear. This unpredictable asymmetry, which did not correlate with age, side, or degeneration state, suggesting that collagen fibers in the FCL are sometimes aligned at a slight positive angle from the bone-to-bone axis and sometimes at a negative angle. Fitting the experimental data to a fiber-composite-based finite element model supported this idea, yielding optimal fits with positive or negative off-axis fiber directions (-40° to +40°). Subsequent examination of selected FCLs by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) showed a similar variability in fiber direction. We conclude that small individual differences in lumbar FCL architecture may have a significant effect on lumbar FCL mechanics, especially at moderate strains.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to evaluate bone strength of the proximal femur with or without hip OA and proximal femoral fracture risk using computed tomography (CT)-based finite element analysis (FEA). A retrospective analysis was done on CT data of 20 patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty for unilateral hip OA. Furthermore, the fracture load between OA and contralateral sides was compared and the association between fracture load and risk factor was analyzed.

While glenohumeral stability has been studied in various settings, few studies have characterized the effect of dynamic rotator cuff muscle loading on glenohumeral translation during shoulder motion. We hypothesize that dynamic rotator cuff muscle activation decreases joint translation during continuous passive abduction of the humerus in a cadaveric model of scapular plane glenohumeral abduction. The effect of different rotator cuff muscle activity on glenohumeral translation was assessed using a validated shoulder testing system. The Dynamic Load profile is a novel approach, based on musculoskeletal modeling of human subject motion. Passive humeral elevation in the scapular plane was applied via the testing system arm, while the rotator cuff muscles were activated according to the specified force profiles using stepper motors and a proportional control feedback loop. Glenohumeral translation was defined according to the International Society of Biomechanics. The Dynamic load profile minimized superior translation of the humeral head relative to the conventional loading profiles. The total magnitude of translation was not significantly different (0.805) among the loading profiles suggesting that the compressive forces from the rotator cuff primarily alter the direction of humeral head translation, not the magnitude. Rotator cuff muscle loading is an important element of cadaveric shoulder studies that must be considered to accurately simulate glenohumeral motion. A rotator cuff muscle activity profile based on human subject muscle activity reduces superior glenohumeral translation when compared to previous RC loading profiles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study establishes a connection between geometric features of the worn region size and slipping. A mechanistic pathway that describes the relationship between the worn region size and slip risk is assessed. Specifically, it is hypothesized that an increased worn region size leads to an increase in under-shoe fluid pressure, which reduces friction, and subsequently increases slipping. The worn region size, fluid pressure, and slip outcome were recorded for 57 participants, who were exposed to an unexpected slip condition. Shoes were collected from each participant and the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) was measured using a tribometer. A greater shoe worn region size was associated with increased slip occurrence. Specifically, a 1 mm increase in the characteristic length of the worn region (geometric mean of its width and length) was associated with an increase in slip risk of ~10%. Fluid pressure and ACOF results supported the mechanistic model: an increase in worn region size correlated with an increase in peak fluid pressure; peak fluid pressures negatively correlated with ACOF; and increased ACOF correlated with decreased slip risk. This finding supports the use of worn region size as a metric to assess the risk of slipping.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To assess the impact of the percutaneous procedure on the aortic wall biomechanics, we designed a novel finite element (FE) protocol for the simulation of endovascular stenting in three patient-specific CoA anatomies, developing a remeshing procedure that allows for coping with different CoA severities. Our FE protocol was able to yield numerical results on stent distortions and stresses, as well as on changes in aortic wall stresses and distensibility. These results were consistent with intraprocedural in-vivo evidences and with previous findings from the literature, and they suggest that our numerical approach could be used to understand the role of patient specific anatomical features (CoA severity and arch type) on the post-stenting aortic biomechanics.

To reduce mechanical loading, exoskeletons have been introduced in the workplace. Substantial reductions in back muscle activity were found when using the exoskeleton during static bending and manual materials handling. However, most exoskeletons only have one joint at hip level, resulting in loss of range of motion and shifting of the exoskeleton relative to the body. To address these issues, a new exoskeleton design has been developed and tested. The present study investigated the effect of the SPEXOR passive exoskeleton on compression forces, moments, muscle activity and kinematics during static bending at six hand heights and during lifting of a box of 10 kg from around ankle height using three techniques: Free, Squat and Stoop. For static bending, the exoskeleton reduced the compression force by 13-21% depending on bending angle. Another effect of the exoskeleton was that participants substantially reduced lumbar flexion. While lifting, the exoskeleton reduced the peak compression force, on average, by 14%. Lifting technique did not modify the effect of the exoskeleton such that the reduction in compression force was similar. In conclusion, substantial reductions in compression forces were found as a result of the support generated by the exoskeleton and changes in behavior when wearing the exoskeleton. For static bending, lumbar flexion was reduced with the exoskeleton, indicating reduced passive tissue strain. In addition, the reduced peak compression force could reduce the risk of compression induced tissue failure during lifting.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Though several clinical and posturographic studies have attempted to reveal the complex pathophysiology involved in PD, the diversity of Parkinsonian population makes them unclear and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, studies related to the Center of Pressure (CoP) sway during quiet stance in PD patients highlight both increase and reduction of magnitude in contrast to age-matched healthy individuals. A possible explanation for this contradiction is presented in this article. While the presence of intermittent control has been observed in postural control in human quiet stance, we hypothesize that one of the factors that affects postural instability in PD might be the increase in intermittency in active feedback control. Using a simulation model representing the Anterior-Posterior dynamics of human quiet standing, the intermittent control strategy is first contrasted against continuous control strategy in terms of stability, energy efficiency and settling time, thus establishing the inherent advantages of an intermittent control strategy. Further, the ability of the intermittent control strategy to explain several clinical observations in PD is demonstrated. An experimental pilot study is also conducted to support the simulation study, and several body sway parameters derived from recordings of CoP are presented. The presented results are in close agreement with reported clinical observations and may also prove useful for the assessment of disease progression and future fall risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, currently, there is no consensus on a reference test. This study aims to characterise five maximal lumbar flexion tests (four classical tests and a new, specifically-developed test designed to constrain pelvic retroversion) based on a three-dimensional, participant-specific musculoskeletal model. Twenty-six male and female participants performed the five tests. Movements were modelled in OpenSim to estimate change in length in lumbar, hamstring and gluteus muscles, together with lumbar flexion and pelvic tilt. These so-called ""inverse"" kinematic results were compared using a two-way ANOVA (sex×test). In a second step, lumbar muscle change in length was computed using a direct kinematic method. Lumbar flexion and lumbar muscle change in length were found to be greater when participants were in seated postures, with little pelvic retroversion. Female participants were observed to have less lumbar flexion than male participants (77±14° and 91±12°, respectively). Hip extensor muscles (hamstrings and gluteus) were fully stretched during each of the five tests. Our results highlight the specific roles of hamstrings, gluteus and lumbar muscles into reaching maximal lumbar flexion. Coupling inverse and direct kinematic methods proved to be a useful tool to enhance our knowledge of lumbar tests. Our findings help to characterise the role of the muscles involved in lumbar flexion, and we propose some recommendations for improving and standardising these tests.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective is to generate hip fracture force risk functions for elderly women and men in sideways falls which can be used for determining effectiveness of fall prevention measures as well as for individual assessment of fracture risk at the clinics. A literature survey was performed and ten publications were identified who contained several hundred individual femoral neck fracture forces in sideways fall for both elderly women and men. Theoretical distributions were tested for goodness of fit against the pooled dataset with the Anderson-Darling test (AD-test) and root mean square errors (RMSE) were extracted. According to the AD-test, a Weibull distribution is a plausible model for the distribution of hip fracture forces. A simple, exponential two-parameter Weibull function was therefore proposed, having a RMSE below 2.2% compared to the experimental distribution for both men and women. It was demonstrated that elderly women only can endure nearly half the proximal femur force for 5 and 10% fracture risk as elderly men. It should be noted though, that women were found to have significantly lesser body height and body weight which would produce less impact force during falls from standing height.

Two groups: non-obese control group (CG; n = 15; age = 40.1 ± 13.9 years; BMI = 23.9 ± 2.8 kg/m2) and obese group (OG; n = 15; age = 44.2 ± 12.4 years; BMI = 42.2 ± 5.2 kg/m2), performed two postural tasks with and without vision in order to collect parameters of center of pressure (CoP) displacements; area (cm2), velocity (mm/s), length (cm) and the ratio length/area. Fatigability was estimated during 60 repeated maximal voluntary contractions of plantar (PF) and dorsal flexors (DF). The maximal force, critical force (Fcr) presenting the asymptote of the force-time evolution and rate of the force decrease (τ) were extracted. Results reported that CoP parameters were higher in OG compared to CG in all postural tasks (p < 0.05). Fcr of PF and DF were 39% and 28% lower respectively in OG compared to CG (p < 0.05). Only τ of PF was 12% lower in OG (p < 0.05). Fcr of PF was negatively correlated with the ratio length/area in OG in all postural tasks (r = 0.86 and r = 0.85, respectively, p < 0.05). We concluded that obesity is associated with a decreased Fcr of ankle muscles expressing the intensity threshold above which fatigue develops drastically. We also revealed that decreased fatigability threshold particularly that of PF, could partly explain postural control alterations in obese adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Such knowledge is especially important for accurate in silico simulations of cardiac pathologies and in the development of novel therapies for their treatment. A prime example is myocardial infarction (MI), which induces profound, regionally variant maladaptive remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) wall. To address this problem, we conducted an in vivo fiduciary marker-based study in an established ovine model of MI to generate detailed, time-evolving transmural in vivo volumetric measurements of LV free wall deformations in the normal state, as well as up to 12 h post-MI. This was accomplished using a transmural array of sonomicrometry crystals that acquired fiducial positions at ∼250 Hz with a positional accuracy of ∼0.1 mm, covering the entire infarct, border, and remote zones. A convex-hull method was used to directly calculate the Jacobian J(t)=Δv(t)/ΔVED from sonocrystal positions over the entire cardiac cycle, where ΔV is the volume of each convex polyhedral at end diastole (ED) (typically ∼1 cc). We demonstrated significant in vivo compressibility in normal functioning LV free wall myocardium, with JES=0.85±0.07 at end systole (ES). We also observed substantial regional variations, with the largest reduction in local myocardial tissue volume during systole in the base region accompanied by substantial transmural gradients. These patterns changed profoundly following loss of perfusion post-MI, with the apical region showing the greatest loss of volume reduction at ES. To verify that the sonocrystals did not affect local volumetric measurements, JES measures were also verified by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging, exhibiting very similar changes in regional volume. We note that while our estimates of regional compressibility were in close agreement with the values previously reported for large animals, ranging from 5% to 20%, the direct, comprehensive measurements of wall compressibility presented herein improved on the limitations of previous reports. These limitations included dependency on the small local volumes used for analysis and often indirect measurement of compressibility. Our novel findings suggest that proper accounting for the myocardial effective compressibility at the ∼1 cc volume scale can improve the accuracy of existing kinematic indices, such as wall thickening and axial shortening, and simulations of LV remodeling following MI.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of anthropometry scaling on the response of the model in side pelvic impact. Three setups from two published studies were used: (1) a lateral drop test (2) a greater trochanter impact with a rigid pendulum (3) a pelvis side impact with a flat surface. The first study used scaling assumption developed for crash test dummy design (setups 1 and 2) and the second performed tests on post mortem human surrogates. The baseline 6 years old child model was scaled using a model morphing methodology to match the stature and weight of the surrogates used in the two published studies. Overall, the main trends observed in the three setups can be approached using the baseline model. Although the model morphing did not account for specific skeletal dimensions, it reduced some of the discrepancies between model response and reference for the drop test and flat plate impact. However, it had little effect on the pendulum test. In that case, the model response was in the corridor at low speed but above at higher speeds. Possible reasons for this difference should be further investigated.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A comparison of two methods to determine recurrence thresholds.,"Ageing affects balance control resulting in a greater amplitude of sway and alterations in structure of the sway time series. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) has been used to determine the structure of center-of-pressure (CoP; a measure that reflects standing postural control) data as a means to quantify how CoP repeats itself / recurs below a certain threshold. This study aimed to determine how the method of threshold determination, below which a recurrence is defined, affects the within-session reliability of RQA in an elderly population. Within-session reliability of RQA of CoP motion in the anterior-posterior and mediolateral directions was assessed in 267 individuals (>65 years old) when standing on firm or foam surface with eyes open or closed for each of two recurrence threshold methods. One threshold method sets the recurrence threshold level such that the recurrence rate is fixed to 5%, the other method sets the recurrence threshold based on 27% of the mean distance between all points from which recurrences are quantified. Reliability across four 30-s balance trials within each of four balance conditions (firm vs. foam, eyes open vs. closed) was determined using intra-class correlation, standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change. ICCs were better, the standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change were smaller when the recurrence threshold was set to 5% using the fixed recurrence threshold.

Disruption of sensory information and prosthetic componentry characteristics may result in increased locomotor task difficulty for individuals with lower limb amputation. This study investigated the accuracy and precision of prosthetic and intact foot placement during a targeted stepping task in individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation (IUTAs; N = 8, 47 ± 13 yrs), compared to the preferred foot of control participant's (N = 8, 33 ± 15 yrs). Participants walked along a 10-metre walkway, placing their foot into a rectangular floor-based target with dimensions normalised to a percentage of participant's foot length and width; 'standard' = 150% x 150%, 'wide' = 150% x 200%, 'long' = 200% x 150%. Foot placement accuracy (relative distance between foot and target centre), precision (between-trial variability), and foot-reach kinematics were determined for each limb and target, using three-dimensional motion capture. A significant foot-by-target interaction revealed less mediolateral foot placement accuracy for IUTAs in the wide target, which was significantly less accurate for the intact (28 ± 12 mm) compared to prosthetic foot (16 ± 14 mm). Intact peak foot velocity (4.6 ± 0.8 m.s-1) was greater than the prosthetic foot (4.5 ± 0.8 m.s-1) for all targets. Controls were more accurate and precise than IUTAs, regardless of target size. Less accurate and precise intact foot placement in IUTAs, coupled with a faster moving intact limb, is likely due to several factors including reduced proprioceptive feedback and active control during prosthetic limb single stance. This could affect activities of daily living where foot placement is critical, such as negotiating cluttered travel paths or obstacles whilst maintaining balance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The choice of foot strike pattern is known to affect external kinetics and kinematics but its effect on internal loading of the metatarsals is not well understood. Subject-specific models of the second metatarsal can be used to investigate internal loading in a non-invasive manner. This study aimed to compare second metatarsal stress between habitual rearfoot and non-rearfoot strikers during barefoot running, using a novel subject-specific mathematical model, including accurate metatarsal geometry. Synchronised force and kinematic data were collected during barefoot overground running from 20 participants (12 rearfoot strikers). Stresses were calculated at the plantar and dorsal periphery of the midshaft of the metatarsal using a subject-specific beam theory model. Non-rearfoot strikers demonstrated greater external loading, bending moments and compressive forces than rearfoot strikers, but there were no differences in peak stresses between groups. Statistical parametric analysis revealed that non-rearfoot strikers had greater second metatarsal stresses during early stance but that there was no difference in peak stresses. This emphasises the importance of bone geometry when estimating bone stress and supports the suggestion that external forces should not be assumed to be representative of internal loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Feasibility testing was performed by comparing FPA performance while wearing the haptic feedback-sensorized shoe with the training targets. Participants performed five walking trials with five randomly-presented FPA targets (10° toe-in, 0°, 10° toe-out, 20° toe-out, and 30° toe-out) of 2 min each on a treadmill. Overall average FPA performance error across all conditions was 0.2 ± 4.1°, and the overall mean absolute FPA performance error across all conditions was 3.1 ± 2.6°. Reducing the size of the no-feedback window resulted in less performance error during walking.

The method was verified on a torque-driven pendulum swing-up problem. A different optimal trajectory was found in a stochastic environment than in the deterministic environment. Next, it was applied to gait to show its application in predictive simulation of human movement.

The results indicate a statistically significant difference (p-value < 0.001) in the duration a PCM liner can retain the appropriate skin temperature, compared to regular silicone liners. Likewise, the presence of air circulation within the socket wall was shown to have statistically significant influences (p-value = 0.018) on providing the efficient cooling effects compared to regular sockets.

The aim of this study was to compare inter-joint coordination (IJC) during obstacle-crossing between people with DPN and healthy controls. Fifteen DPN and 15 healthy people crossed over obstacles with heights of 10% and 20% of the subject's leg length. The mean absolute relative phase (MARP) and deviation phase (DP) of both leading and trailing limbs were used to calculate the phase dynamic and variability of IJC. Furthermore, correlation between Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fall Efficacy Scale (FES-I), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and MARP, DP were assessed in DPN group. There was no significant interaction between group and obstacle height on measured variables. However, Group had significant main effect on DP of hip-knee in leading limb (p < 0.05). Additionally, the main effects of the obstacle's height were significant on MARP of hip-knee of trailing limb (p < 0.01) and knee-ankle in leading limb (p < 0.05).

This score was also significantly correlated with hip-knee DP of both trailing and leading limbs when crossing 10% obstacle (r = 0.59, 0.57, respectively, p < 0.05).

These structures are often assumed to move in synchrony, despite evidence that neurologically compromised populations exhibit altered kinematics. Preterm infants are widely considered to be a neurologically compromised population and often experience feeding difficulties, yet measuring performance, and how performance matures in pediatric populations is challenging. Feeding problems are often compounded by complications arising from surgical procedures performed to ensure the survival of preterm infants, such as damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) during patent ductus arteriosus correction surgery. Here, we used a validated infant pig model for infant feeding to test how preterm birth, postnatal maturation, and RLN lesion interact to impact hyoid and thyroid excursion and their coordination. We filmed infant pigs when feeding using videofluorscopy at seven days old (1-2 months human equivalent) and 17 days old (6-9 months human equivalent) and tracked movements of the hyoid and thyroid on both days. We found that preterm birth impacted the coordination between hyoid and thyroid movements, but not their actual excursion. In contrast, excursion of the two structures increased with postnatal age in term and preterm pigs. RLN lesion decreased thyroid excursion, and primarily impacted hyoid movements by increasing variation in hyoid excursion. This work demonstrates that RLN lesion and preterm birth have distinct, but pervasive effects on feeding performance in infants, and suggest that interventions targeted towards reducing dysphagia should be prescribed based off the etiology driving dysphagia, rather than the prognosis of dysphagia.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Existing techniques to identify foot contact using accelerometers offer a viable option for identifying foot contact in the field. However, these techniques often require the placement of additional accelerometers or the identification of impact peaks, which can be difficult when peaks are low. Using resultant tibial acceleration to identify foot contact may overcome these limitations.

Additionally, we sought to establish the concurrent validity of this new technique. An algorithm to identify foot contact from a local minimum in the resultant tibial acceleration waveform was developed and tested in nineteen rearfoot strike runners. Foot contact determined from the resultant tibial acceleration occurred 2.3 ± 4.7 ms earlier than foot contact determined from vertical ground reaction force, with 95% limits of agreement of -6.8 to 11.5 ms. The difference between the two methods was less than 10 ms for 183 out of 190 foot contacts. These findings compare favorably to previous techniques for identifying foot contact using accelerometers.

Functional ability declines with advanced age, likely due to changes in muscle function. This study aimed to examine the relationship between muscle quality and muscle power with kinematics from functional tests in a population of 21 institutionalized frail nonagenarian (91.3 ± 3.1 years). Here, muscle quality was measured by segmenting areas of high- and low-density fibers with computerized tomography. In addition, muscle strength and muscle power were obtained through maximal strength and power tests using resistance exercises. Finally, functional capacity outcomes (i.e., balance, gait velocity and sit-to-stand ability), as well as kinematic parameters, were evaluated from a tri-axial sensor used during a battery of functional tests. Our results show that lower limb muscle quality, maximal strength and power output present statistically significant relationships with different kinematic parameters, especially during the sit-to-stand and gait tests (e.g. leg power and maximum power during sit-to-stand (r = 0.80) as well as quadriceps muscle mass and step asymmetry (r = -0,71). In particular, frail individuals with greater muscle quality needed less trunk range of motion to make the transition between sitting and standing, took less time to stand up, and exerted a major peak power of force. As a conclusion, a loss of muscle quality and power may lead to motor control impairments such as gait, sit-to-stand and balance that can be the cause of adverse events such as falls.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A proposed mechanism to the development of knee OA is the assiduous execution of load carriage tasks. Soldiers are often required to maintain a walking gait with load at velocities beyond their gait transition velocity (GTV) known as forced marching. The primary aim of this investigation is to determine the interactive effects of load magnitude and locomotion pattern on relative knee total joint moment (KTJM) in healthy recruit-aged women. The secondary aims are to determine knee total joint moment limb differences and to determine the interactive effect of load magnitude and locomotion pattern on the percent contributions of each plane of motion moment. Individuals were tasked with running and forced marching at 10% above their GTV at body weight (BW) and with an additional 25% and 45% of their BW. KTJM was analyzed at two specific gait events of heel-strike and mid-stance. At heel-strike, forced marching exhibited greater KTJM compared to run for all load conditions but running had greater KTJM than forced marching at mid-stance. The forced marching pattern exhibited larger KTJM for the dominant limb at both gait events compared to running. Lastly, at mid-stance the knee adduction moment percent (KAM%) contribution was greater for forced marching compared to running. The forced marching pattern demonstrates joint kinetics that may be more deleterious with prolonged exposure.

Computational head models that can replicate this age-related injury pattern are valuable tools to help addressing this concern. Although a biofidelic brain-skull interface modelling strategy is essential for accurate ASDH prediction, approaches with different simplifications have been used in existing head models to simulate the interaction between the brain and skull with their ASDH predictability unknown. Thus, the current communication evaluates the applicability of different brain-skull interface modelling approaches for ASDH prediction associated with age-related brain atrophy. Four representative approaches are selected by simulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as Lagrangian-represented solid and Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) represented fluid, each with or without tangential sliding aginst the brain. The chosen approaches are implemented in three models with various degrees of atrophied brain, which are subsequently exposed to an experimentally measured loading known to cause ASDH. The results show, only when simulating the CSF as ALE elements with sliding interface against the brain, a relatively higher ASDH risk characterized by increased cortical relative motion and BV strain peaks are predicted by the atrophied model without causing excessive mesh distortion in the CSF elements. The results of this study provide guidance for brain-skull interface modelling, particularly for the prediction of ASDH in different age groups.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the biomechanical mechanisms underlying the effects of TC practice on fall risk among older adults remain unanswered. The objective of this pilot study was to examine how TC gait biomechanically impacts the human body in terms of dynamic gait stability and lower limb muscle strength in comparison with regular walking gait. Ten healthy adults performed five trials of TC gait following three to seven trials of regular walking. Full body kinematics and kinetics were collected, and then dynamic gait stability and lower limb joint moments were determined. During TC gait, individuals were less stable, moved more slowly and experienced a larger mediolateral movement in comparison with regular walking gait. The peak moment at the ankle joint on the sagittal and transverse planes, at the knee joint on all three planes, and at the hip joint on the frontal plane was significantly different when performing TC gait than during regular gait. The results indicate that TC gait challenges body balance and requires more muscle strength of the lower limb joints compared to regular walking gait. To cope with these challenges, the body could develop neuromuscular control strategies to maintain body balance and thus reduce the risk of falls. The findings and methodology in this study could provide preliminary guidance for identifying optimal TC forms in order to maximize the effects of TC-based fall prevention interventions among various populations with elevated risk of falls.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A common explanation for this phenomenon is that stress fibers reorient along the direction where they are unaffected by the applied cyclic stretch and thus can maintain optimal (homeostatic) tensile force. The ability of cells to achieve tensional homeostasis in response to external disturbances is important for normal physiological functions of cells and tissues and it provides protection against diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis. However, quantitative experimental data that support the idea that stretch-induced reorientation is associated with tensional homeostasis are lacking. We observed previously that in response to uniaxial cyclic stretch of 10% strain amplitudes, traction forces of single endothelial cells reorient in the direction perpendicular to the stretch axis. Here we carried out a secondary analysis of those data to investigate whether this reorientation of traction forces is associated with tensional homeostasis. Our analysis showed that stretch-induced reorientation of traction forces was accompanied by attenuation of temporal variability of the traction field to the level that was observed in the absence of stretch. These findings represent a quantitative experimental evidence that stretch-induced reorientation of cellular traction forces is associated with the cell's tendency to achieve tensional homeostasis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to identify a clinically useful marker for early tendon damage. We hypothesized that alterations in mean echogenicity are linked with changes in vitro tendon mechanics. To test our hypothesis, we harvested Achilles tendons from 10 fresh-frozen cadaveric feet and cyclically fatigued them using a universal test frame while we continuously acquired ultrasound images. Throughout this fatigue protocol, we applied 2 stress tests every 500 loading cycles to quantify changes in ultrasound imaging echogenicity. We continued this fatigue protocol until each tendon either failed completely or survived 150,000 cycles. Tendons that failed during the fatigue loading (6/10) underwent greater changes in mean echogenicity compared to tendons that did not fail (P = 0.031). These tendons that failed during fatigue loading demonstrated greater changes in mean echogenicity that surpassed 1.0%; whereas survivor tendons exhibited less than 0.5% changes in mean echogenicity. We found that changes in mean echogenicity measured with ultrasound increased proportionally with increased tendon damage. The magnitude of these changes was relatively small (<1.5% change in mean echogenicity) but may be an effective predictor of tendon failure. Mean echogenicity is a promising marker for quantifying fatigue damage in cadaveric Achilles tendons during a stress test. Although these changes cannot be detected with the naked eye, computer-based predictive models may effectively assess risk of tendon damage in physically active adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Most clinically relevant engineered cartilage constructs seed human chondrocytes onto a collagen scaffold, which buckles at low loads and strains. This buckling creates local regions of high strain that could cause cell death and damage the engineered tissue. Since human tissue engineered cartilage is commonly grown in-vivo prior to implantation, new matrix deposition could improve the local implant mechanics and prevent local tissue buckling. However, the relationship between local biochemical composition and the local mechanics or local buckling probability has never been quantified. Therefore, this study correlated the local biochemical composition of human tissue engineered cartilage constructs using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with the local shear modulus and local buckling probability. The local shear modulus and local buckling probability were obtained using a confocal elastography technique. The local shear modulus increased with increases in local aggrecan content in the interior region (inside the scaffold). A minimum amount of aggrecan was required to prevent local construct buckling at physiologic strains. Since the original scaffold was primarily composed of collagen, increases in collagen content due to new matrix deposition was minimal and had little effect on the mechanical properties. Thus, we concluded that aggrecan deposition inside the scaffold pores is the most effective way to improve the mechanical function and prevent local tissue damage in human tissue engineered cartilage constructs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Lumbar peak joint reaction forces and peak and integrated moments are strong correlates of LBP. To investigate these risks, this study compared three common waste collection throwing techniques of varying lumbar symmetry: the symmetric (SYM) technique, the asymmetric fixed stance (AFS) technique, and the asymmetric with pivot (AWP) technique. Lumbar moments and joint reaction loads were computed for throwing garbage bags of 3, 7, and 11 kg to quantify the effects that technique and object weight have on LBP risk. LBP risk factors were computed using a full-body musculoskeletal model in OpenSim. Muscle activations were estimated using two methods: the EMG-assisted method, which included electromyography data in the solution, and the conventional static optimization method, which did not. The EMG-assisted method more accurately reproduced measured muscle activation, resulting in significantly larger peak compressive and shear forces (p < 0.05) of magnitudes indicative of LBP risk. Risk factors associated with the SYM technique were either larger or not statistically different compared to the asymmetric techniques for the 3 kg condition; however, the opposite result occurred for the 7 and 11 kg conditions (p < 0.05). These results suggest using rapid, asymmetric techniques when handling lightweight objects and slower, symmetric techniques for heavier objects to reduce LBP risk during waste collection throwing techniques. Results indicating increased risk between asymmetric techniques were mostly inconclusive. As expected, increasing bag mass generally increased LBP risk factors, regardless of technique (p < 0.05).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the mechanisms underlying the alteration of the mechanical and electrical environment at the disc-vertebra interface related with disc degeneration have not been well studied. The objective of this study was to numerically investigate the long-term distributions of mechanical and electrical signals on the disc-vertebra interface with disc degeneration. A three-dimensional finite element model of a human lumbar IVD was used to study the mechanical and electric signals at the interface between disc and vertebral body. The disc degeneration was simulated by reducing the nutrition levels on the nucleus pulposus (NP)-vertebra interface and on the annulus fibrosus (AF) periphery to 30% and 60% of its normal values, respectively. In the simulation, the total external mechanical load applied to the disc-vertebra segment was assumed unchanged during disc degeneration. The simulation results showed that the compressive stress of solid matrix changed by up to ~37 kPa on the NP-vertebra interface, while it increased by up to ~32 kPa on the AF-vertebra interface. The shear stress increased by up to ~37 kPa with disc degeneration. The absolute value of the electric potential on the disc-vertebra interface of the disc slightly decreased with the disc degeneration (~0.5 mV). The knowledge of these spatial and temporal variations of the mechanical stresses and electric potential on the disc-vertebra interface is important for understanding the vertebrae adaptation and remodeling during disc degeneration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this regard, three-dimensional printing (3D) technique needs bio-materials with higher mechanical and biological performance. The biomaterials with high mechanical performance beside its bio compatibility are limited. A novel bio-material made of Alginate, Hyaluronic acid, Halloysite Nanotube and Polyvinylidene Fluoride was used and characterized for printing cartilage bio scaffolds through numerical studies. CaCl2 was used for crosslinking of biomaterial. Scanning Electron Microscopy, mechanical tests (tensile and compressive test), MTT assay were conducted for evaluating this novel biomaterial. Different structures of bio material were simulated for numerical studies. The numerical study was performed in ANSYS 18 using three parameter Mooney-Rivlin model. According to experimental and numerical results, Halloysite Nanotube increases the tensile and compressive strength of biomaterial up to 47%. Results show that biomaterial have good mechanical performance due to mechanical forces required for cartilage bio scaffolds besides its high biological performance. Polyvinylidene fluoride reduces the mechanical performance while increasing the cell viability.

For example, homogenization methods that predict the function and responses of tissues based upon the properties of the tissue's constituents require estimates of cell volume fractions. A common way to estimate cellular volume fraction is to image cells in thin, planar histologic sections, and then invoke either the Delesse or the Glagolev principle to estimate the volume fraction from the measured area fraction. The Delesse principle relies upon the observation that for randomly aligned, identical features, the expected value of the observed area fraction of a phase equals the volume fraction of that phase, and the Glagolev principle relies on a similar observation for random rather than planar sampling. These methods are rigorous for analysis of a polished, opaque rock sections and for histologic sections that are thin compared to the characteristic length scale of the cells. However, when histologic slices cannot be cut sufficiently thin, a bias will be introduced. Although this bias - known as the Holmes effect in petrography - has been resolved for opaque spheres in a transparent matrix, it has not been addressed for histologic sections presenting the opposite problem, namely transparent cells in an opaque matrix. In this note, we present a scheme for correcting the bias in volume fraction estimates for transparent components in a relatively opaque matrix.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Seventeen transfemoral amputees were asked to walk on 77.8 m in preferred speed under four conditions: 1) no added mass, 2) the knee joint relocated downwards by 18% of the total shank length, shank mass decreased by 68%, thigh mass increased by 7%, 3) the knee joint relocated downwards by 37% of the total shank length, shank mass decreased by 68%, thigh mass increased by 7% and 4) thigh mass increased 17%, shank mass decreased by 38%. Trunk accelerations were recorded by a triaxle accelerometer, attached at the L3 level of spine. For each condition, stability (orbital and local), intra-limb step length and step time variability, step length and step time symmetry, were estimated from the vertical acceleration. Our findings showed no significant change in the orbital stability (P = 0.627) and the local stability (P = 0.748). In addition, no significant difference was found in the step length symmetry (P = 0.891), intra-limb step length variability (P > 0.234), the step time symmetry (P = 0.960) and intra-limb step time variability (P > 0.847) with the new prosthetic configurations.

In order to be compensated for, the effects of STA must be characterized across a broad sample population and for different motion activities. In this study, the error introduced by STA on the kinematics of the hip joint and of its individual components, and on the location of the hip joint center (HJC) was quantified for fifteen THA subjects during overground gait, stair descent, chair rise and putting on socks. The error due to STA was computed as the difference between the kinematics measured with motion capture and those measured simultaneously with moving fluoroscopy, a STA-free X-ray technique. The main significant effects of STA were: underestimation of the hip range of motion for all four activities, underestimation of the flexion especially during phases of the motion with higher flexion, overestimation of the internal rotation, and lateral misplacement of the HJC mostly due to the functional calibration. The thigh contributed more to the STA error than the pelvis. The STA error of the thigh appeared to be correlated with the hip flexion angles, with a varying degree of linearity depending on the activity and on the phase of the motion cycle. Future kinematic-driven STA compensation models should take into account the non-linearity of the STA error and its dependency of the phase of the motion cycle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A longitudinal pilot study on early post-stroke individuals.,"Typical clinical gait outcomes mostly focus on function; only sparse information exists on gait quality, i.e. symmetry or more natural gait patterns. It remains unclear whether functional gait recovery improves with gait quality, or whether these are two independent processes. The objective of this observational pilot study is to examine whether the gait quality improves with gait function (i.e. speed) over the course of early recovery. Full lower body gait kinematics were measured longitudinally in a clinical environment using wearable inertial measurement units. We recorded six individuals with subacute stroke (<1 month) for a total of 56 physical therapy sessions over the initial recovery stage of 12 weeks. We examined relations between gait symmetry in spatiotemporal, limb and joint kinematic parameters compared to gait function. We observed that overall gait symmetry improved with walking speed, but limb and joint kinematic parameters remained asymmetric at the maximum level of recovery (both p < 0.01). We also found that limb kinematic parameters (R2 = 41.9%) of the impaired side was preferentially associated with functional gait recovery over joint kinematics (R2 = 33.1%). These data suggest that our pilot cohort did not achieve ""true"" gait recovery despite achieving typical measures of recovery in gait speed and spatiotemporal symmetry.

Muscle activation and optimization in frontal impact scenarios using computational Human Body Models have not been investigated over the broad range of accelerations relevant to these events. This study optimized the muscle activation of a contemporary finite element model of the human head and neck for human volunteer experiments over a range of frontal impact severities (2 g to 15 g). The neck muscles were grouped as flexors and extensors, and optimization was undertaken for each group based on muscle activation level and activation time. The boundaries for optimization were defined using data from the literature and a preliminary parametric study. A linear polynomial method was used to optimize the model head kinematics to the volunteer experiments for each impact severity. The optimized models predicted muscle activation to increase with higher impact severities, and improved the average cross-correlation by 35% (0.561-0.755) relative to the Maximum Muscle Activation (MMA) scheme in the original model. Importantly, a newly proposed Cocontraction Muscle Activation (CMA) scheme for maintaining the head in a neutral posture provided a 23% on average improvement in correlation compared to the MMA scheme. In conclusion, this study identified a new scheme to obtain more accurate response kinematics across multiple impact severities in computational Human Body Models as well as contributing to the understanding of muscle influence during frontal impact scenarios.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Occurring most commonly due to intubation of infants, tracheal stenosis often requires corrective surgery. It is challenging to determine the most effective surgical strategy for a given patient as current clinical methods used to assess tracheal stenosis are simplistic and subjective, and are not rigorously based on aerodynamic considerations. This paper summarizes a non-invasive approach based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and medical imaging to establish relationships between trachea anatomy and inspiration performance. Though patient-specific CFD analysis has gained recent popularity, an objective of this study is to computationally formulate dimensionless analytical correlations between anatomy and performance that are applicable to any member of a class of patients and that can be interpreted within the context of the Myer-Cotton stenotic airway classification system. These correlations can provide aerodynamics-based insight for the development of more robust stenosis evaluation methods and may allow for time-efficient assessment of corrective surgical strategies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this paper, we take confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and mouse myoblast (C2C12) cells as model systems to probe how cells collectively adapt their mechanical features in response to a free tissue boundary. We show that the free boundary not only can trigger unjamming transition but also induces cell fluidization nearby the boundary. The Young's moduli of cells near the boundary are found to be much lower than those of interior cells. We demonstrate that the stiffness of cells in monolayers with a free tissue boundary exhibits negative dependence on the projected cell area, in contrast to previous studies where cells were found to stiffen as cellular area increases in a confluent MDCK monolayer without boundary. In addition, the free tissue boundary may activate cell remodeling, rendering volume enlargement and cell-specified cytoskeleton organization.

In many patients, pulmonary function is also impaired, resulting in poorly-oxygenated cardiac outflow competing against well-oxygenated VA-ECMO outflow, a condition known as North-South syndrome. North-South syndrome is a primary concern because of its potential to cause cerebral hypoxia, which has a critical influence on neurological complications often seen in this patient population. In order to reduce ischemic neurological complications, it is important to understand how clinical decisions regarding VA-ECMO parameters influence blood oxygenation. Here, we studied the impacts of flow rate and cannulation site on oxygenation using a one-dimensional (1D) model to simulate blood flow. Our model was initially tested by comparing blood flow results to those observed from experimental work in VA-ECMO patients. The 1D model was combined with a two-phase flow model to simulate oxygenation. Additionally, the influence of various other clinician-tunable parameters on oxygenation in the common carotid arteries (CCAs) were tested, including, blood viscosity, cannula position within the insertion artery, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), as well as geometrical changes such as arterial radius and length. Our results indicated that blood oxygenation to the brain strongly depended on the cannula insertion site and the VA-ECMO flow rate with a weaker but potentially significant dependence on arterial radius. During femoral cannulation, VA-ECMO flow rates greater than ~4.9L/min were needed to perfuse the CCAs. However, axillary and central cannulation began to perfuse the CCAs at significantly lower flow (~1L/min). These results may help explain the incidence of cerebral hypoxia in this patient population and the common need to change cannulation strategies during treatment to address this clinical problem. While this work describes patient-averaged results, determining these relationships between VA-ECMO parameters and cerebral hypoxia is an important step towards future work to develop patient-specific models that clinicians can use to improve outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although this bilateral deficit in jumping has been believed to be due to the reduction of leg extensor force/work exertions, we hypothesised that the three-dimensional biomechanical differences between double-leg and single-leg jumps also influence the bilateral deficit in jumping. Here, we show the substantial effect of the elevation of the pelvic free-leg side in single-leg squat jumps on the bilateral deficit in jumping in addition to extensor force reduction. We collected the kinematic and ground reaction force data during single-leg and double-leg squat jumps from ten male participants using motion capture systems and force platforms. We determined the components of the mechanical energy directly contributing to the height of the centre of mass due to segment movement. The energy due to rotations of the foot, shank, thigh, and pelvis were significantly greater in single-leg squat jumps than in double-leg squat jumps. The magnitudes of the difference in energy between single-leg and double-leg squat jumps due to the pelvis (0.54 ± 0.22 J/kg) was significantly larger than that due to any other segment (<0.30 J/kg). This indicates that pelvic elevation in single-leg jump is a critical factor causing bilateral deficit in jumping, and that humans generate the jumping height with a single leg not just by an explosive leg-extension but also by synchronous free-leg side elevation of the pelvis. The findings suggest that this pelvic mechanism is a factor characterising human single-leg jumps.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The conceptual distance to a theoretical major reflection site, termed effective reflection distance (ERD), has been associated with aging and augmentation index (AIx) clinically. However, it remains unclear whether and how ERD varies and associates with AIx when the hemodynamic condition is acutely perturbed in a patient. The objective of this study was to address this issue in rigorously controlled animal experiments. In 13 anesthetized dogs, we measured arterial pressure, aortic flow and femoral arterial flow, while altering the hemodynamic condition over wide ranges by administering zatebradine (bradycardic agent), nitroprusside (vasodilator), noradrenaline (vasoconstrictor), dobutamine (inotrope), and dextran (volume-expander). Using the measured data, we determined ERD based on an arterial model comprising a tube with a complex frequency-dependent load (ERDTL), which has been considered a physiologically valid model. We also determined ERD based on wave separation (ERDWSA) and pressure-based analyses (ERDAW). ERDTL was shortened significantly in response to nitroprusside or dobutamine infusion, and was significantly and negatively associated with AIx in multiple regression analysis using pooled data. ERDWSA or ERDAW did not necessarily correlate with ERDTL in terms of responses to drug administration or association with AIx. In conclusion, under diverse hemodynamic conditions, ERDTL changes sensitively and shows physiologically reasonable association with AIx. This result substantiates the importance of paying close attention to medications during clinical analysis of wave reflection.

Besides, assessment of spastic muscle's active state forces in conditions involving intermuscular mechanical interactions and gait relevant joint positions is lacking. Therefore, the source of flexor forces limiting joint motion remains unclear. The aim was to test the following hypotheses: (i) in both passive and active states, spastic semitendinosus (ST) per se shows its highest forces within gait relevant knee angle (KA) range and (ii) due to intermuscular mechanical interactions, the active state forces elevate. Isometric forces (seven children with CP, GMFCS-II) were measured during surgery over a range of KA from flexion to full extension, at hip angle (HA) = 45° and 20°, in four conditions: (I) passive state, (II) individual stimulation of the ST, simultaneous stimulation of the ST (III) with its synergists, and (IV) also with an antagonist. Gait analyses: intraoperative data for KA = 17-61° (HA = 45°) and KA = 0-33° (HA = 20°) represent the loading response and terminal swing, and mid/terminal stance phases of gait, respectively. Intraoperative tests: Passive forces maximally approximated half of peak force in condition II (HA = 45°).

We have conducted an experiment to compare the differences in kinematics and muscle activations during climbing on regular stairs and a stairmill. Twelve subjects participated in this study. They first walked on regular stairs five times and then performed a one-minute continuous walking on a stairmill. The results showed several important differences. During continuous walking on a stairmill, when compared to regular stairs, there was (i) an increase in the percentage of stance phase during a walking cycle, (ii) a higher angle of plantarflexion of the ankle during the transition from stance phase to swing phase, and (iii) a decrease in muscle activation of the tibialis anterior during swing phase. These differences would provide additional insights into the design of future rehabilitation systems and to interpret human data obtained from stairmills.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This quantitative study examines participants' attitude changes following one such event. By prioritizing increasing excitement and engagement over teaching content, we anticipate that students' opinions of engineering and biomechanics will improve following the event. Pre- and post-test surveys consisting of Likert scale and semantic differential (SD) items assessed changes in three key areas: self-identity as a scientist and engineer, attitudes toward engineering, and attitudes toward biomechanics. Based on unpaired and paired student responses, we found significant gains in all three areas. Students agreed more strongly with statements regarding whether they saw themselves as scientists and engineers, and they had improved attitudes toward engineering in general and biomechanics specifically. The SD scales also reflected improved opinions of both science and biomechanics. These more positive attitudes could eventually lead to more students recruited to study a variety of engineering disciplines, ultimately addressing the ongoing national shortage of qualified engineers.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Bone consists of hydroxyapatite, Type I Collagen, mucopolysaccharides and bone fluid, which associates with bone constituents and improves the mechanical properties of bone. Knowing that dehydration causes dimensional changes comparable to those observed in the mechanical testing of a bone sample, here, the dehydrated organic component of lamellar bone was modelled to contract towards the mineral, forming a contraction vector as the surface normal of the mineral plate. The amount of dehydration based contraction in rotated collagen fibrils was calculated for two models of sublamellar arrangements, namely A and B, where the mineral plate of the 0° (axial, [0 0 1]) sublamellar collagen fibril was oriented respectively along either (0 1 0) or (0 0 1) planes. Projections of sublamellar contraction vectors were denoted as u, v and w displacements at 10°-20°-30° angles and summed to give the lamellar total. Using the total displacements, anisotropy ratios of properties in directions parallel (W) versus perpendicular (U or V) to the osteonal axis were calculated. With dehydration, the osteonal lamellae in Model A (behaving as positive Poisson's ratio material) may display maximal planar expansion (at 1.4%) and peraxial contraction (-0.24%), which may even cause sample warping. The large variation in the wet and dry bone anisotropy ratios of the models demonstrates the effect of collagen orientation on bone mechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

AFOs improve static balance but AFO-users are still at high fall risk. To our knowledge, no one has studied the biomechanical effect of AFO-use on the compensatory stepping response required to avoid falling during dynamic conditions such as trip, the leading cause of falls. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a semi-rigid thermoplastic AFO on the compensatory stepping response in young healthy individuals following trip-like treadmill perturbations. We found that the AFO on the stepping leg (AFO-step) decreased trunk stability (increased trunk angle and angular velocity), shortened the compensatory step length, and reduced dynamic stability (smaller COM-BOS). AFO on the support leg (AFO-support) was only marginally different from the No-AFO condition. Detrimental changes in compensatory stepping response (e.g. decreased trunk stability) were linearly correlated to diminished propulsive impulse of the step. In summary, AFO-use on the stepping leg is associated with impaired compensatory stepping response (e.g. reduced trunk stability) and decreased propulsive impulse in young adults. It is important to note that AFO-use enhances static stability and decreases the probability of a trip/stumble occurring indicating they are important for fall prevention. Still, our results suggest that AFO-use may impair the compensatory stepping response after a trip/stumble has occurred and may suggest that preserving plantarflexion function may support the compensatory stepping response. Further study of these devices and their impact on compensatory stepping response in fall-prone individuals is warranted.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To understand the mechanical behavior of biomimetically mineralized collagen material (BMC), we examined the composition and structure of the mineral deposition in BMCs mineralized by the polymer-induced liquid precursor (PILP) process and applied wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) with in situ tensile testing to investigate the mineral-to-tissue co-deformation in the material. We found that the PILP process is able to achieve good biomimetic mineralization in bulk collagen matrix. Compositionally, the mineral deposition showed high crystallinity with no carbonation. However, the morphology of extrafibrillar mineral deposition and the preferential crystal orientation were different from natural bone. Further, the Young's modulus and mineral-to-tissue co-deformation ratio of the BMC were significantly lower than both natural bone and partially demineralized bone with similar mineral volume fraction. It was concluded that while biomimetic mineralization can achieve good mineral deposition volume in the BMC, the mechanical behavior of the material was different from natural bone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet the impact of infant body position on muscle activity is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate neck and back muscle activity of healthy infants in common positions and baby devices. Healthy full-term infants (n = 22, 2-6 months) participated in this experimental study. Daily sleep and positioning were reported by caregivers. Cervical paraspinal and erector spinae muscle activity was measured using surface electromyography (EMG) in five positions: lying prone, lying supine, held in-arms, held in a baby carrier, and buckled into a car seat. Mean filtered EMG signal and time that muscles were active were calculated. Paired t-tests were used to compare positions to the prone condition. Caregivers reported that infants spent 12% of daily awake time prone, 43% in supine-lying baby gear, and 44% held in-arms or upright in a baby carrier. Infants exhibited highest erector spinae activity when prone, and lowest cervical paraspinal muscle activity in the car seat. No differences were found between in-arms carrying and babywearing. This first evaluation of the muscle activity of healthy infants supports the importance of prone time in infants' early spinal development because it promotes neck and back muscle activity. Carrying babies in-arms or in baby carriers may also be beneficial to neck muscle development, while prolonged time spent in car seats or containment devices may be detrimental to spinal development.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Eight fresh-frozen knees were mounted in a knee extension rig with quadriceps loading and tibial extension torque measurement. Each knee was subject to four conditions: native knee, PFA, cruciate-retaining (CR) and posterior-stabilized (PS) TKA. The KET was measured from 120° to 0° knee flexion. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc paired t-tests. The native KET was lowest in terminal extension and 70-100° flexion, and maximal at 20-30° flexion. PFA produced the greatest KET (p < 0.008) compared with native, CR- and PS-TKA, at 30-40° flexion. CR- and PS-TKA had lower KET across 0-50° flexion (p < 0.001 across 0-30°), falling to 25% of the native knee KET or the PFA at full extension. PFA had the highest KET in early flexion possibly due to increased trochlear offset and/or preservation of the cruciate mechanism, so PFA may be more beneficial during the functional range of motion. The claimed benefits of PS- over CR-TKA in deep flexion were not detected. Both CR- and PS-TKAs led to lower KET than the native and PFA knee states across 0-50° flexion. This mechanical effect may help to explain clinical findings of knee extension weakness post-TKA.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Its mechanical properties determine the amount of the power amplification and the subsequent locomotion performance. As previously reported, the SLP cuticle endures physiological dynamic loadings. However, the time-scale mechanical properties of the SLP are still unknown, especially under stress relaxation and cyclic loadings. In this paper, the SLP cuticles of adult desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) were studied using stress relaxation and cyclic tests, with loadings corresponding to the physiological loading conditions of the power amplification. The SLP cuticle was found to show pronounced stress relaxation behavior with the resultant force and an evident time shift between the maximal displacement and the maximal resultant force. The number of loading cycles before mechanical failure (life cycle number) increases when the SLP cuticle is cyclically loaded by a lower stress level. Moreover, the failure strength of the SLP at low cycles equals the physiological stress level in the power amplification, implying that the healing of the cuticle might contribute to the successful performance of numerous jumps in the course of the adult locust life. This study not only deepens our understanding of the power amplification mechanism of locust locomotion but also provides valuable knowledge for the design optimization of bioinspired jumping robots and elastic energy storage devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This experiment aimed to compare the coordination of the trunk, hip, knee, and ankle and its variability between individuals with long- and short-term restricted visual input during STS. Forty-five female children participated in this study, including fifteen congenitally blind (CB) children and 30 healthy children. The healthy children were divided randomly into two groups: one group in which the participants were instructed to keep their eyes open (EO) and another to keep their eyes closed (EC) for 20 min before the test. In the standing phase, CB children had a decreased ankle-knee vector angle on the nondominant (ND) side compared to that of healthy children. In the sagittal plane, a small coefficient-of-correspondences (CoC) was observed at seat-off (hip-trunk CoC on the dominant (D) side and ankle-hip CoC on the ND side) and in the preparation phase (ankle-hip CoC on the ND side and bilateral hip CoC). In the frontal plane (at the end: ankle-knee, in the standing phase: bilateral hip) a high CoC was observed (in the standing phase: knee-trunk CoC on the D side). The EC group had smaller CoCs at initiation event (knee-trunk and bilateral knee CoCs on both sides), the end event (ankle-knee and ankle-hip CoCs on the ND side), and in the standing phase (bilateral hip CoC) in the frontal plane than the other groups.

The cause and effect relationship between postures and pain has been therapeutically investigated and widely used to guide patient care. Shift of the nucleus pulposus (NP) inside the intervertebral disc when the spine changes posture in the sagittal plane, known also as NP migration, has been observed and quantified in in-vivo studies. However, the effects of this phenomenon on biomechanics of the disc and the surrounding spinal structures has not been investigated. This study aimed to quantify the effects of the NP location in a moderate flexion posture on spinal load and load-sharing using a Finite Element (FE) model of the L4-L5 functional spinal unit (FSU) driven by muscle forces, reaction forces, ligament forces and disc moment predicted by a Musculoskeletal (MSK) model of the trunk. The results showed that intradiscal pressure (IDP) and compressive force are sensitive to the nucleus location while the effects on the center of rotation (CoR), center of reaction (CTR) and moment rotation curves were negligible. Also, our findings revealed that FE models should consider the effects of NP location during bending to predict more realistic results as the nucleus displacement caused by disc bulge predicted by these models is much smaller than the real shift observed in in-vivo. In addition, this study confirmed that position of the rigid joint in MSK models that fix this latter to the CoR, must be modelled carefully for more accurate muscle forces and spinal loads prediction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Yet, managing the high volume kinematic data generated through in-home neurogames requires data quality control that, executed insufficiently, jeopardizes accuracy of outcomes. To begin to address this issue at the intersection of biomechanics and ""big data"", we performed a secondary analysis of a neurogame, evaluating gesture count as well as shoulder and elbow joint angle outcomes calculated from kinematic data in which valid gestures were identified through 3 methods: visual review of regions of interest by an expert (BP); manufacturer-recommended data smoothing (MS); and automated methods (AI). We hypothesized that upper extremity kinematic outcomes from BP would be matched by AI but not MS methods. From one person with post-stroke hemiparesis, upper-extremity kinematic data were collected for 6 days over 2 weeks using a Microsoft Kinect™-based neurogame. We calculated gesture count, shoulder angle, and elbow angle outcomes from data managed using BP, MS, and AI methods. BP identified 1929 valid gestures total over 6 days which was different than the other two methods (p = 0.0015). In contrast, the AI algorithm with best precision identified 4372 and MS identified 4459 valid gestures. Furthermore, angle outcomes calculated from AI and MS methods resulted in different values than BP (p < 0.001 for 5 of 6 variables).

The toe flexor strength, foot arch height and vertical jump performance were studied in 31 healthy young men. For the measurement of toe flexor strength, participants explosively exerted maximum force on a toe grip dynamometer. The maximum isometric force (Fmax) and the rate of force development (RFD) of the toe flexor strength were evaluated. Foot arch height was assessed as the distance between the navicular tuberosity and the floor. Fmax and foot arch height were normalized by body mass (rFmax) and height, respectively. Three types of vertical jumps without arm swing were performed on a force plate: a squat jump (SJ), a countermovement jump (CMJ), and a rebound jump (RJ). Fmax, rFmax and RFD of the toe flexor strength were positively correlated with the vertical jump height in the SJ (r = 0.408, r = 0.452, r = 0.514) and CMJ (r = 0.377, r = 0.444, r = 0.548) and the rebound jump index in the RJ (r = 0.549, r = 0.582, r = 0.575); however, foot arch height was not correlated with the vertical jump performance, and it was only significantly correlated with the minimum ground reaction force relative to body weight during the unloading phase of the CMJ (r = -0.366).

Estimates of CoP often focus on forces that individuals exert in a single plane through the feet (standing on force plates). However, balance may also be supported by forces other than those developed at the feet, especially when walkers, handrails, and other aids are used. In these cases, it is common to neglect the contributions of handheld supports. Here, we derive and apply equations for an extended CoP that incorporates handhold forces. We then examine the influence of CoP definition (i.e., including or ignoring handhold forces) on common metrics (path length; RMS and maximum excursion; average and maximum velocity) for 12 younger adults with a handrail located lateral to the participants' dominant hand. Participants attempted balance recovery in response to a range of small, medium and large forward and backward platform translations. Significant interactions between perturbation magnitude and CoP definition were found for most metrics. Notably, the interaction of CoP definition and perturbation magnitude significantly affected path length (p-values < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses revealed larger CoP path length when handrail forces were incorporated in CoP estimates compared to ignoring handrail forces at medium (backward: 59.9 vs. 19.0% height; forward: 70.5 vs 22.4% height) and large perturbation magnitudes (backward: 69.9 vs 22.4% height; forward: 103.5 vs 24.6% height). Incorporation of hand forces in CoP calculations can present a different view of postural balance control than relying on a feet-only CoP.

Thirty-nine manual wheelchair users (athletic n = 25; nonathletic n = 14) propelled their own daily living wheelchair on a roller ergometer at two submaximal speeds for three minutes (1.11 m s-1 and 1.67 m s-1). A 10 camera Vicon motion capture system (Vicon, Motion Systems Ltd. Oxford, United Kingdom) collected three-dimensional kinematics of the upper limbs and thorax at 200 Hz during the final minute of each propulsion trial. Kinetics, kinematics and kinematic variability were compared between athletic and nonathletic groups. Kinematic differences were investigated using statistical parametric mapping. Athletic MWU performed significantly greater physical activity per week compared to nonathletic MWU (920 ± 601 mins vs 380 ± 147 mins, respectively). However, no significant biomechanical differences between athletic and nonathletic MWU were observed during either propulsion speed. During the 1.11 m s-1 trial wheelchair users displayed a stroke frequency of 53 ± 12 pushes/min and a contact angle of 92.5 ± 16.2°. During the 1.67 m s-1 trial the mean stroke frequency was 64 ± 22 pushes/min and contact angle was 85.4 ± 13.6°. Despite the hand being unconstrained during the recovery phase the magnitude of joint kinematic variability was similar across both glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints during recovery and push phases.

However, the direction and extent of tooth movement under functional loads are unknown. This study investigated maxillary molar mobility, alveolar bending, and periodontal space (PDL) fluid pressure during mastication and masseter muscle contraction in young pigs, along with PDL space measurements. Twelve three-month-old farm pigs were instrumented with some or all of the following: (1) ultrasonic crystals, one implanted into the pulp chamber of a deciduous maxillary molar and additional crystals glued onto its buccal and palatal alveolar plates; (2) rosette strain gauges affixed to the buccal and palatal of alveolar ridges; (3) a pressure transducer inserted into palatal alveolar bone facing the PDL. Tooth mobility, alveolar bending, and fluid pressure were simultaneously recorded during unrestrained feeding and subsequent masseter muscle stimulation. The PDL widths were measured using micro-CT. The results indicate that during the power stroke of mastication, (1) the molar displaced buccally and apically (192 ± 95 µm) regardless of the side of chewing; (2) compressive bone strain was greater on the buccal than on the palatal alveolar plate; and (3) PDL pressure increased during the power strok (3.63 ± 0.80 kPa). Masseter contraction produced similar results but with generally lower values. The PDL widths were larger than the range of tooth mobility, and showed no correlation with the mobility.

An additional mechanism that can be used to stabilize gait, is the counter-rotation mechanism, i.e., changing the angular momentum of segments around the CoM to change the direction of the ground reaction force. The relative contribution of these mechanisms to the control of the CoM is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relative contribution of these mechanisms to control the CoM in the anteroposterior (AP) direction during a normal step and the first recovery step after perturbation in healthy adults. Nineteen healthy subjects walked on a split-belt treadmill and received unexpected belt acceleration perturbations of various magnitudes applied immediately after right heel-strike. Full-body kinematic and force plate data were obtained to calculate the contributions of the CoP-mechanism and the counter-rotation mechanism to control the CoM. We found that the CoP-mechanism contributed to corrections of the CoM acceleration after the AP perturbations, while the counter-rotation mechanism actually counteracted the CoM acceleration after perturbation, but only in the initial phases of the first step after the perturbation. The counter-rotation mechanism appeared to prevent interference with the gait pattern, rather than using it to control the CoM after the perturbation. Understanding the mechanisms used to stabilize gait may have implications for the design of therapeutic interventions that aim to decrease fall incidence.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous works have postulated that the formation of the vortex ring downstream of the mitral annulus is affected by LV diastolic impairment. However, no previous works have considered how the strength of the vortex ring will decay inside the ventricle after its formation. Although the vortex ring formation relates to the very initial stage of the filling, the decay process is governed by a large portion of the diastolic time and will be affected by the interaction of the ventricle walls and the vortex ring. Here we used in-vivo measurements and presented a mechanistic model to calculate the evolution of the vortex ring strength and predict the rate of vortex ring decay within the left ventricle. The results demonstrated the actual circulation decay rate was universal, remaining nearly unchanged across all subjects of varying LV geometry or diastolic function.

This study aimed to (1) develop a personalized finite element (FE) model that automatically updates spinal geometry for different patients; and (2) apply this technique to study the influence of LL on post-fusion spinal biomechanics. Using an X-Ray image-based algorithm, the geometry of the lumbar spine (L1-S1) was updated using independent parameters. Ten subject-specific nonlinear osteoligamentous FE models were developed based on pre-operative images of fusion surgery candidate patients. Post-operative FE models of the same patients were consequently created. Comparison of the obtained results from FE models with pre- and post-operation functional images demonstrated the potential value of this technique in clinical applications. A parametric study of the effect of LL was conducted for cases with zero LL angle, positive LL angles (+6° and +12°) and negative LL angles (-3° and -6°) on fused level (L4-L5), resulting in a total of 50 fusion simulation models. The average range of motion, intradiscal pressure, and fiber strain at adjacent levels were significantly higher with decreased LL during different directions except axial rotation. This study demonstrates that the LL alters both the intersegmental motion and load-sharing in fusion, which may influence the initiation and rate of adjacent level degeneration.

Coordination patterns can be identified by categorizing the tangent lines of an angle-angle plot by their direction, termed ""coupling angle binning"" or ""phase binning"". In the literature the ranges of directions, or ""bins"", originally divided by Chang et al. and more recently by Needham et al. have different strengths. Chang's method identifies general patterns with large bins while Needham's method identifies a dominant joint or segment in the pattern. This study created a novel method that incorporates bin categories from both methods, and therefore recognizes both general patterns and a dominant contributor when appropriate. This new method, the SRC method, as well as the two existing methods, were used to quantify knee-ankle coordination in the sagittal plane for healthy individuals and an individual with clubfoot during gait. Similarities and differences in classification between methods were compared and further investigated by interpreting the uncoupled angular data. Each method was then used to evaluate sagittal-coronal coordination of the forefoot in an individual with clubfoot during gait. This was done to demonstrate across-plane coordination analysis, to confirm that the advantages of the combined method extend to coupling pairs with like ranges of motion, and to present a clinical application. It was found that the TSRH binning methods provides a more complete description of coordination by including coordination categories defined by both the Chang and Needham method.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is unknown if such process during walking would change. Therefore, the aims of this study were to quantify (1) head and trunk control in healthy participants (HPs) and patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH) during walking with and without visual manipulation; and (2) the correlation/association between vestibular function and head/trunk control during walking with visual manipulation in patients. Seventeen UVH patients and 15 HPs completed all the tests. They participated in the caloric test, which was used to examine vestibular function, and walked on a treadmill with and without visual manipulation. Head and trunk angular displacement and velocity were primary outcome measures, deviation of center of mass and step variability were secondary. Head roll angular displacement (7.38° ± 1.38 [mean ± SE] v.s. 12.95° ± 1.48, p = 0.004) and head-trunk correlation (in the pitch/sagittal plane: 0.22 ± 0.05 v.s. 0.38 ± 0.05, roll/frontal plane: 0.35 ± 0.06 v.s. 0.55 ± 0.06, p < 0.05) were significantly lower in patients compared to HPs. Head pitch angular velocity (8.58°/s ± 2.17 v.s. 14.23°/s ± 1.22, p = 0.026) and step width variability (0.075 ± 0.010 v.s. 0.083 ± 0.009, p = 0.04) increased with visual manipulation only in patients. No significant correlation/association was found between vestibular function and head/trunk control. Lower head-trunk correlation in patients suggests an independent head-trunk control strategy in response to vestibular impairment. Visual input could be used by patients to compensate for vestibular disturbance for head control and foot placement. Severe UVH may not lead to worse postural control compared to mild disorder.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, standardized methods to collect the reference posture trials for this normalization do not exist. The purpose of this study was to determine posture (seated or standing) and number of trials that should be collected and how to calculate the angle that best represents the maximum range. Forty healthy adults (22 females, 18 males) completed 12 reference trials: 1 upright standing, 5 standing flexion, and 5 seated flexion trials. The maximum lumbar angle was found for each flexion trial. Additionally, different methods to calculate the maximum were applied by taking the maximum of the 5 standing, 5 seated, and all 10 flexion trials. An interaction was found between posture, order, and trial number. 42.5% and 57.5% of participants reached their maximum angle during seated and standing flexion respectively which may be due to back- vs hip-dominant movement strategies. 85% of participants achieved their maximum at some point during the first six flexion trials. The maximum angle of all 10 flexion trials was significantly greater than the angle of the first standing or seated trial only but not significantly greater than the maximum of all seated or standing flexion trials respectively. Secondarily, no differences in the maximum lumbar angle were found between sexes. This study suggests that 6 flexion trials, involving both standing and seated flexion, should be collected to best represent the maximum end range of spine flexion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These measures are often easier to interpret if they are reported relative to a reference posture. However, since Euler Angles are not vectors, directly subtracting their values is difficult to justify mathematically. We compared four methods for subtracting a reference posture: the Subtraction Method (SM), directly subtracting the Euler Angles; two variants on the Relative Segment Method (RSM), one aligned to global (gRSM) and one aligned to the distal segment (dRSM), which considers the relative rotation of each segment to the reference posture; and the Relative Joint Method (RJM), which considers the relative rotation of the joint coordinate systems compared to that of the reference posture. One exemplar male subject (height: 175 cm; body mass: 90 kg; age: 27) performed three trials where they extended, laterally bent to the right, and extended while returning to a neutral posture between these movements. Two reference postures were compared: a standing neutral posture, and 90 degrees of flexion. All four methods showed strong agreement when the reference posture was a neutral one (lowest R2=0.971). However, when the reference posture was 90 degrees of flexion, both the RJM and gRSM swapped their lateral bend and axial twist measures. Additionally, when the reference posture was oriented 90 degrees from the global coordinate system, the gRSM swapped flexion and lateral bending. Therefore, the RJM, dRSM, and even the SM, are more robust than the gRSM. Either the RJM or dRSM are recommended as it is a compromise between mathematical validity and interpretability, however, the RJM seems to provide more readily interpretable angular velocities. The SM is only a viable approach under very strict conditions and should be avoided.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to investigate aging effects on lateral precision stepping performance in reaction to near and distant foot placement targets during treadmill walking. We hypothesized that older adults would step to targets later and less accurately than young adults, and that these difference would be more pronounced for distant targets. During the study, young and older adults stepped on lateral targets projected onto the surface of a treadmill one stride prior to their targeting step. We measured stepping accuracy to the target, the time when the swing foot diverged from its normal swing trajectory, and swing phase gluteus medius activity. Both groups had similar performance stepping to near targets, suggesting that giving older subjects a full stride to react to target location mitigates visuomotor processing delays that have contributed to deficits in stepping performance in prior studies. However, when stepping to distant targets, older adults had larger errors and later divergence times than young adults. This suggests that age-related deficits other than those in visuomotor processing contribute to poorer performance for more difficult stepping tasks. Furthermore, while young adults increased early swing gluteus medius activity with lateral target distance, older adults did not. This is the first study to show a potential neuromuscular basis for precision stepping deficits in older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This paper proposes a multivariate statistical methodology to adjust muscle force-generating parameters optimally. Dynamic residuals are minimized as muscle force-generating parameters are varied (maximal isometric force, optimal fiber length, tendon slack length and pennation angle).First, a sensitivity and a Pareto analyses are carried out in order to sort out and screen the set of parameters having the greatest influence regarding the dynamic residuals. These parameters are then used to create a response surface following a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. Finally, this surface is used to determine the optimum levels of the design variables (muscle force-generating parameters). The proposed methodology is illustrated by the adjustment of a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of a sheep forelimb. After adjustment, the reserve actuator values of the elbow and wrist joints were reduced, on average, by 18%, and 16%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of multivariate statistical strategies is an effective way to adjust model parameters optimally while reducing dynamic inconsistencies. This study constitutes a step towards a more robust methodology in musculoskeletal modelling, focusing on muscular parameter tuning.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aims of this study were to express movement strategies that represent whole-body dynamic stability, and to explore their association with potentially injurious joint mechanics and side cutting performance. Twenty recreational soccer players completed 45° unanticipated side cutting. Five distinct whole-body dynamic stability movement strategies were identified, based on factors that influence the medial ground reaction force (GRF) vector during ground contact in the side cutting manoeuvre. Using Statistical Parametric Mapping, the movement strategies were linearly regressed against selected performance outcomes and peak knee abduction moment (peak KAM). Significant relationships were found between each movement strategy and at least one selected performance outcome or peak KAM. Our results suggest excessive medial GRFs were generated through sagittal plane movement strategies, and despite being beneficial for performance aspects, poor sagittal plane efficiency may destabilise control of the CoM. Frontal plane hip acceleration is the key non-sagittal plane movement strategy used in a corrective capacity to moderate excessive medial forces. However, whilst this movement strategy offered a way to retrieve control of the CoM, mitigating reduced whole-body dynamic stability, it also coincided with increased peak KAM. Overall, whole-body dynamic stability movement strategies helped explain the delicate interplay between the mechanics of changing direction and undesirable joint moments, providing insights that might support development of future intervention strategies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

After proper participant positioning on the instrument, the left forefoot was passively moved from eversion (20°) to inversion (45°) at 2°/s, while the rearfoot and shank were kept immobile. From the instrument's sensing units (torque meter and potentiometer at 100 Hz), passive torque and angle data were registered. Passive stiffness was calculated as the instantaneous slope of the torque vs. angle curve. Therefore, the variables analyzed were resting angle, passive torques and stiffnesses during inversion and eversion through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3,3), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC95). For the resting angle, ICC3,3 ranged from 0.85 to 0.91, SEM ranged from 1.54° to 1.95° and MDC95 ranged from 4.26° to 5.41°. For the torques, ICC3,3 ranged from 0.85 to 0.97, SEM ranged from 0.09Nm to 0.42Nm and MDC95 ranged from 0.26Nm to 1.16Nm. Finally, for the stiffnesses, ICC3,3 ranged from 0.79 to 0.98, SEM ranged from 0.01Nm/° to 0.04Nm/° and MDC95 ranged from 0.01Nm/° to 0.10 Nm/°.

We explored whether damage to the collagen nanostructure of tendon resulting from tensile rupture varies with temperature. Use of bovine tail tendons in combination with NaBH4 crosslink stabilization treatment allowed us to probe the mechanisms underlying the observed changes. Untreated tendons and NaBH4-stabilized tendons were pulled to rupture at temperatures of 24, 37, and 55 °C. Of nine mechanical parameters measured from the resulting stress-strain curves, only yield stress differed between the tendons tested at 37 and 24 °C. When tested at 55 °C, untreated tendons showed large reductions in ultimate strength and toughness, while NaBH4-stabilized tendons showed smaller reductions. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to assess damage to the collagen fibril nanostructure of tendons resulting from rupture, with samples from the ruptured tendons compared to samples from the same tendons removed prior to loading. While there was indication that overload-induced molecular packing disruption to collagen fibrils may be heightened at 37 °C, statistical increases in damage compared to that occurring at 24 °C were only seen when testing was conducted at 55 °C. The results show that the temperature sensitivity of tendon to ramp loading depends on crosslinking within the tissue. In poorly crosslinked tissues, collagen may be more susceptible to mechanical damage when tested at physiologic temperature compared to room temperature. For tendons with a high density of thermally stable crosslinks, such as the human Achilles or patellar tendons, testing at room temperature should produce comparable results to testing at physiologic temperature.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Synergy pattern and relative muscle weight were calculated by non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) algorithm method. The results showed that using the VAF method, five muscle synergies were extracted from the emg data during running. After the fatigue, the number of muscular synergies did not show a change, but relative weight of the muscles changed.

While numerical modelling techniques such as fluid-structure interaction (FSI) are promising, an outstanding challenge is to accurately predict the deformation of the airway during breathing and thus the occurrence of OSA. These difficulties arise because the effective stiffness of the soft tissue in the human upper airway varies due to neuromuscular effects on the stiffness of the underlying muscles. In addition, both the elasticity and anisotropy of the soft tissues along the upper airway are poorly characterised. Finally, gravitational effects on anatomic features are yet to be considered. In this study, a validated FSI technique is introduced that allows prediction of the extent and position of the major deformation in the upper airway. This technique is used to analyse the behaviour of the upper airway in the two most common sleeping positions and for a range of effective tissue stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that sleeping position, gravity and soft tissue stiffness (used here as a proxy for neuromuscular effects) are the main factors that affect upper airway collapse.

The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant features to be considered to maximize the accuracy of a logistic regression model designed for prediction of fall/mortality risk among older people. This study included 261 adults, aged over 65 years. Men and women were analyzed separately because sex stratification was revealed as being essential for our purposes of feature ranking and selection. Participants completed a 3-m walk test at their own gait velocity. An inertial sensor attached to their lumbar spine was used to record acceleration data in the three spatial directions. Signal processing techniques allowed the extraction of 21 features representative of gait kinematics, to be used as predictors to train and test the model. Age and gait speed data were also considered as predictors. A set of 23 features was considered. These features demonstrate to be more or less relevant depending on the sex of the cohort under analysis and the classification label (risk of falls and mortality). In each case, the minimum size subset of relevant features is provided to show the maximum accuracy prediction capability. Gait speed has been largely used as the single feature for the prediction fall risk among older adults. Nevertheless, prediction accuracy can be substantially improved, reaching 70% in some cases, if the task of training and testing the model takes into account some other features, namely, sex, age and gait kinematic parameters.

However, only a handful of studies have investigated its potential stiffening effect on dynamic brain strains; yet, they report contradictory findings. Here, we reanalyze the cerebrovascular stiffening effect by incorporating vasculature derived from the latest neuroimaging atlases into a re-meshed Worcester Head Injury Model using an embedded element method. Regional brain strains with and without vasculature were simulated using a reconstructed, predominantly sagittal head impact. Using the two previously adopted linear or non-linear vessel material models, we reproduced the earlier conflicting results (~40% vs. ~1-6% in regional strain reductions). Nevertheless, with refitted non-linear material models chosen to represent the average dynamic tension behaviors of arteries and veins, respectively, inclusion of vasculature reduced regional brain strains by ~13-36% relative to the baselines without vasculature. Compared to the whole brain baseline response, inclusion of vasculature led to an element-wise linear regression slope of 0.8 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8. The vascular stiffening effect appears mild for the whole brain but more significant locally, which should not be ignored in head injury models.

These data are typically acquired from cadaveric testing. Increasingly, they are also estimated from subject-specific imaging-based finite element (FE) models, which are typically built from CT/MR data obtained in supine position and employ pure rotation kinematics. We explored the sensitivity of FE-based lumbar passive rotational stiffness to two aspects of functional in-vivo kinematics: (a) passive strain changes from supine to upright standing position, and (b) in-vivo coupled translation-rotation kinematics. We developed subject-specific FE models of four subjects' L4L5 segments from supine CT images. Sagittally symmetric flexion was simulated in two ways: (i) pure flexion up to 12° under a 500 N follower load directly from the supine pose. (ii) First, a displacement-based approach was implemented to attain the upright pose, as measured using Dynamic Stereo X-ray (DSX) imaging. We then simulated in-vivo flexion using DSX imaging-derived kinematics. Datasets from weight-bearing motion with three different external weights [(4.5 kg), (9.1 kg), (13.6 kg)] were used.

But, determining the accuracy of its RGB-D image data stream in measuring the joint kinematics and local dynamic stability remains an unsolved problem. This study examined the suitability of Kinect(v2) RGB-D image data stream in assessing those gait parameters. Fifteen healthy participants walked on a treadmill during which lower body kinematics were measured by a Kinect(v2) sensor and a optophotogrametric tracking system, simultaneously. Extended Kalman filter was used to extract the lower extremity joint angles from Kinect, while inverse kinematics was used for the gold standard system. For both systems, local dynamic stability was assessed using maximal Lyapunov exponent. Sprague's validation metrics, root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE were computed to confirm the difference between the joint angles time series of the two systems while relative agreement between them was investigated through Pearson's correlation coefficient (pr). Fisher's Exact Test was performed on maximal Lyapunov exponent to investigate the data independence while reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients.

However, these models include only larger coronary arteries as smaller side branches cannot be resolved and are therefore neglected. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of neglecting the flow to these side branches when computing angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (vFFR) and indices of volumetric coronary artery blood flow. To compensate for the flow to side branches, a leakage function based upon vessel taper (Murray's Law) was added to a previously developed computational model of coronary blood flow. The augmented model with a leakage function (1Dleaky) and the original model (1D) were then applied to predict FFR as well as inlet and outlet flow in 146 arteries from 80 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography and FFR measurement. The results show that the leakage function did not significantly change the vFFR but did significantly impact the estimated volumetric flow rate and predicted coronary flow reserve. As both procedures achieved similar predictive accuracy of vFFR despite large differences in coronary blood flow, these results suggest careful consideration of the application of this index for quantitatively assessing flow.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We use a graphical representation of WSS using shear rosettes to map temporal changes in the flow dynamics during a cardiac cycle at any spatial location on the vessel surface. The presence of secondary flows and flow reversals can be interpreted directly from the shape of the shear rosette. The mean WSS is given by the rosette centroid, the OSI by the splay around the rosette origin, and the transWSS by its width. We define a new metric, anisotropy ratio (AR), based on the ratio of the length to width of the shear rosette, to capture flow bi-directionality. We characterized the flow physics in controls and patient specific geometries of the ascending aorta (AA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) that have fundamentally different flow dynamics due to differences in the Reynolds and Womersley numbers.

Linear mixed models for each muscle were used to assess how SWV was influenced by humeral elevation, chronological age, sex, BMI and three functional measures. All significances are reported at α = 0.05. Humeral elevation influenced shear wave velocity at a statistically significant level for AD, BB, SC and MT (all p < 0.047). Chronological age was a significant predictor of mean SWV for the sternocostal region of the pectoralis major and the middle trapezius (both p < 0.03).

Findings indicated that the lordotic posture, as compared to the kyphotic one, resulted in marked increases in back global muscle activities (~14-19%), overall segmental compression (~7.5-46.1%) and shear (~5.4-47.5%) forces, and L5-S1 facet joint forces (by up to 80 N). At the L5-S1 level, the lordotic lumbar posture caused considerable decreases in the moment resisted by passive structures (spine and musculature, ~14-27%), negligible reductions in the maximum disc fiber strains (by ~0.4-4.7%) and small increases in intradiscal pressure (~1.8-3.4%). Collectively and with due consideration of the risk of fatigue and viscoelastic creep especially under repetitive lifts, current results support a free posture (in between the extreme kyphotic and lordotic postures) with moderate contributions from both active and passive structures during lifting activities involving trunk forward flexion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This has multiple effects on the function of the muscle, e.g. on force production and on contraction velocity. Here we present a versatile geometrical model that predicts changes in muscle architecture as a consequence of length changes of the muscle on the basis of the known architecture at a given muscle length. The model accounts for small changes in aponeuroses' dimensions relative to changes in fascicle length and keeps muscle volume constant. We evaluate the model on the rabbit soleus muscle by comparing model predictions of fascicle lengths and pennation angles with experimental data. For this, we determined the internal architecture of the soleus muscle at different muscle belly lengths (67.8 mm at 35° ankle angle and 59.3 mm at 80° ankle angle). The long and the short soleus muscle exhibited mean fascicle lengths and pennation angles of 20.8 ± 1.3 mm, 4 ± 2° and 13.5 ± 1 mm, 10 ± 4°, respectively. The model predicted reasonable mean fascicle lengths and pennation angles for the long and short soleus that differed only by 1 mm and 1° from the measured data, respectively. Differences between predicted and measured distributions seem to stem from interindividual variability in muscle architecture. Even if the proposed approach has been used for the soleus muscle, which is relatively simple in architecture, it is not restricted to homogeneous unipennate architectures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this study, we propose a parametric study based on the computational fluid dynamics with the aim of providing information regarding aortic disease. In particular, the blood flow inside a parametrized aortic arch is computed as a function of morphological changes of baseline aorta geometry. Flow patterns, wall shear stress, time average wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index were calculated during the cardiac cycle. The influence of geometrical changes on the hemodynamics and on these variables was evaluated. The results suggest that the distance between inflow and aortic arch and the angle between aortic arch and descending trunk are the most influencing parameters regarding the WSS-related indices while the effect of the inlet diameter seems limited. In particular, an increase of the aforementioned distance produces a reduction of the spatial distribution of the higher values of the time average wall shear stress and of the oscillatory shear index independently on the other two parameters while an increase of the angle produce an opposite effect. Moreover, as expected, the analysis of the wall shear stress descriptors suggests that the inlet diameter influences only the flow intensity. As conclusion, the proposed parametric study can be used to evaluate the aorta hemodynamics and could be also applied in the future, for analyzing pathological cases and virtual situations, such as pre- and/or post-operative cardiovascular surgical states that present enhanced changes in the aorta morphology yet promoting important variations on the considered indexes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Microniche geometry is critical for regulating the phenotype and function of the chondrocyte in native cartilage and tissue engineering constructs. However the role of microniche geometry in the mechanical properties and calcium signaling of chondrocytes remains unknown. To recapitulate microniche geometry at single-cell level, we engineered three basic physiological-related polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microniches geometries fabricated using soft lithography. We cultured chondrocytes in these microniche geometries and quantified cell mechanical properties using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fluorescent calcium indicator was used to record and quantify cytosolic Ca2+ oscillation of chondrocytes in different geometries. Our work showed that microniche geometry modulated the mechanical behavior and calcium signaling of chondrocytes. The ellipsoidal microniches significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of chondrocytes compared to spheroidal microniche. Additionally, ellipsoidal microniches can markedly improved the amplitude but weakened the frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillation in chondrocytes than spheroidal microniche. Our work might reveal a novel understanding of chondrocyte mechanotransduction and therefore be useful for designing cell-instructive scaffolds for functional cartilage tissue engineering.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

MitraClip was recently approved in the US for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), which significantly expands the number of patients that can be treated with this device. This study aims to quantify the morphologic changes and evaluate the biomechanical interaction between the MitraClip device and the mitral apparatus of a real patient case with FMR using computational modeling. MitraClip procedures using a central and a lateral clip were simulated in a validated MV-left ventricle finite element (FE) model with severe MR. The patient-specific model integrated detailed geometries of the left ventricle, mitral leaflets and chordae, incorporated age- and gender-matched nonlinear hyperelastic human material properties, and accounted for chordae tethering forces. Central and lateral positioning gave similar biomechanical outcomes resulting in an improved but incomplete MV coaptation. Antero-posterior distance, annulus area, valve opening orifice area, and regurgitant orifice area decreased by up to 26%, 19%, 48% and 63% when compared to the pre-clip model, respectively. Anterior and posterior leaflet peak stresses increased by up to 64% and 62% after clip placement, respectively, and were located at the region of clip grasp. Similarly, anterior and posterior leaflet peak strains increased by up to 20% and 10%, respectively.

Currently, rib (costal) cartilage is used to carve the auricle. However as alternative, tissue engineered and synthetic materials are being developed to restore the auricle shape to overcome donor site morbidity and limited availability of rib cartilage. However, to date there is limited knowledge regarding the mechanical properties of the auricular and costal cartilage to optimise the required compressive properties of the graft. The remnant auricular and costal cartilage from 20 patients undergoing stage-1 microtia surgery was harvested. On the day of surgery, the cartilage was evaluated in compression, with each sample loaded to 300 g at 1 mm/s. RESULTS: The costal cartilage was observed to have a significantly higher Young's Elastic Modulus than auricular cartilage (average costal cartilage 11.43 MPa vs average auricular cartilage 2 MPa, p < 0.0001). The auricular cartilage showed a significantly higher relaxation rate than costal cartilage (average costal cartilage 0.72 MPa10-4 vs average auricular cartilage 1.93 MPa10-4, p < 0.05). The final absolute relaxation was significantly lower for elastic cartilage than costal cartilage (average costal cartilage 3.35 MPa vs average auricular cartilage 0.2 MPa, p < 0.0001). Alloplastic cartilage replacements used as alternatives for reconstruction were also evaluated. Silicone, Gore-Tex and Medpor were observed to have significantly higher Young's Elastic Modulus than costal and auricular cartilage. Costal cartilage has a higher Young's Elastic Modulus in compression compared to auricular cartilage.

The present study investigated age-related differences in lower limb JM and JP during turning between young adults (YAs) and old adults (OAs). We introduced the hierarchical Bayesian inference for comparing and identifying differences in JM, angular velocity(ω), and JP at each stance phase in the two age groups. This study included 16 healthy YAs and 16 healthy OAs (8 men and 8 women in each group). Participants performed 90° step turns to the right at a self-selected natural speed. On comparing the age groups, during 90° step turning, the OA group exhibited larger extention hip JM and JP to control (brake) the upper body in the sagittal plane, exhibited larger abductor moment in each lower limb joint for preventing the body from leaning in the frontal plane during the mid-stance phase, and exhibited larger hip JP and ω and smaller ankle JM in the transverse plane to rotate the body during the mid-stance phase. Our findings suggested that the overall reliance on the hip joint to control body motion in each anatomical plane during step turning is higher in the OA group than in the YA group.

Reference L5/S1 moments were calculated using an inverse dynamics bottom-up laboratory model (buLABmodel), based on data from a measurement system comprising optical motion capture (OMC) and force plates (FPs). System performance of (1) a bottom-up ambulatory model (buAMBmodel) using lower-body kinematic IMC and FS data, and (2) a top-down ambulatory model (tdAMBmodel) using upper-body kinematic IMC data and hand forces (HFs) were compared. HFs were estimated using full-body kinematic IMC data and FS forces. Eight males and eight females lifted a 10-kg box from different initial vertical/horizontal positions using either a free or an asymmetric lifting style. As a measure of system performance, root-mean-square (RMS) errors were calculated between the reference (buLABmodel) and ambulatory (tdAMBmodel &buAMBmodel) moments. The results showed two times smaller errors for the tdAMBmodel (averaged RMS errors < 20 Nm or 10% of peak extension moment) than for the buAMBmodel (average RMS errors < 40 Nm or 20% of peak extension moment).

Most in vitro studies are limited in the ability to quantify the magnitude of bulging on the posterior aspect of the disc due to the boney structures that occlude a direct line-of-sight in the intact functional spinal units (FSUs). This study examined anterior and posterior annulus fibrosus (AF) bulges in reduced (posterior elements removed) cervical porcine specimens across four loading conditions and two postures. Surface scans from the anterior and posterior aspect of the IVD were recorded in both neutral and flexed postures using a 3D laser scanner to characterize changes in AF bulge. A significant negative correlation was observed for peak AF bulge on the anterior and posterior side of the disc in a flexed posture (Pearson's r = -0.448; p = 0.002; r2 = 0.2003).

Fretting-corrosion initiates when micromotion leads to metal release; however, factors leading to micromotion, such as microgrooves on the stem taper, are not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to describe a finite element analysis technique to determine head-neck contact mechanics and investigate the effect of stem taper microgroove height during head-neck assembly. Two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element models were created. Models were created for a ceramic femoral head and a CoCrMo femoral head against Ti6Al4V stem tapers and compared to available data from prior experiments. Stem taper microgroove height was investigated with a generic 12/14 model. Head-neck assembly was performed to four maximum loads (500 N, 2000 N, 4000 N, 8000 N). For the stem taper coupled with the ceramic head, the number of microgrooves in contact and plastically deformed differed by 2.5 microgrooves (4%) and 6.5 microgrooves (11%), respectively, between the finite element models and experiment. For the stem taper coupled with the CoCrMo head, all microgrooves were in contact after all assembly loads in the finite element model due to an almost identical conical angle between the taper surfaces. In the experiments, all grooves were only in contact for the 8000 N assembly load. Contact area, plastic (permanent) deformation, and contact pressure increased with increasing assembly loads and deeper microgrooves. The described modeling technique can be used to investigate the relationship between implant design factors, allowing for optimal microgroove design within material couples.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Failure to restore native kinematics post-injury often leads to long-term consequences including chronic instability and arthritis. Using traditional motion capture, it is difficult to distinguish independent motions of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints to assess the effects of injury, surgical repair, and rehabilitation on ankle joint complex (AJC) kinematics. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the accuracy of dynamic biplane radiography for determining in vivo AJC kinematics and arthrokinematics, and to identify sport-related movements that require the largest AJC range of motion (ROM) during support. Two subjects had three to five 1.0 mm diameter tantalum beads implanted into the tibia, fibula, talus, and calcaneus during lateral ankle ligament repair. Six months after surgery, the subjects executed seven movements while biplane radiographs were collected. Bone motion was tracked using radiostereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) as a ""gold standard"", and compared to a volumetric CT model-based tracking algorithm that matched digitally reconstructed radiographs to the original biplane radiographs. Over all movements, the average tibiotalar, subtalar and tibiofibular RMS errors were 0.5 mm ± 0.2 mm, 0.8 mm ± 0.5 mm and 0.8 mm ± 0.3 mm in translation and 1.4° ± 0.4°, 1.5° ± 0.5° and 1.7° ± 0.6° in rotation, respectively.

In this study, we assessed the reliability and robustness of the postural system based on the optimization properties of the CoP signal: descending, local and global stability, and convergence. For the analysis, we used CoP data from 146 participants (104 [71%] female, age 46 ± 23 years, body mass index 23.6 ± 3.4 kg/m2) recorded while standing quietly on a foam surface without visual input. Reliability was estimated using the intraclass correlation coefficient from a single (ICC2,1) and averaged (ICC2,3) measurements. Robustness was assessed through main and interaction effects for the signal duration (60, 30 s), sampling frequency (100, 50 Hz), and lowpass filtering cutoff frequency (10, 5 Hz). The observed reliability depended on the use of average or single measurements as it was excellent for the stability property (ICC2,k ≥ 0.772); excellent-to-acceptable (ICC2,3 ≥ 0.540) or excellent-to-unacceptable (ICC2,1 ≥ 0.281) for the descending property; and excellent-to-unacceptable (ICC2,3 > 0.295; ICC2,1 > 0.122) for the convergence property. Robustness analysis showed large main effects of signal duration (ω2 ≤ 0.834, p < 0.001), sampling frequency (ω2 ≤ 0.526, p < 0.001), and the lowpass filter cutoff frequency (ω2 ≤ 0.523, p < 0.001) on the optimization properties; but all two-way and three-way effects varied from medium to trivial. Reliability is thus excellent to acceptable for deriving the descending, stability, and convergence properties from the average of three measurements. Those optimization properties are robust to the interaction but not the main effects of methodological sources of variation of posturography.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Orthopaedics is yet to adapt to innovative trends in health monitoring. Despite an evident entry point during orthopaedic surgeries, clinicians remain unable to objectively examine the structural integrity and biomechanics in the operated region through implantable sensors. As such, postoperative advice can be non-specific and poorly guided. This perspective discusses the clinical need for load-sensing implants that address biomechanical postoperative monitoring, taking the example of spinal interbody cages. Research has attempted to establish sensing approaches in different orthopaedic settings; however, they fail to meet mechanical sensing requirements or lack in vivo translatability, especially in the spine. Polymeric flexible sensors and Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) have favourable attributes aligned to the required features for in vivo load-sensing, although these approaches are yet to be tested extensively in orthopaedics. While inductive powering is promising, wireless energy transfer and telemetry are areas of ongoing research. This perspective proposes a thorough understanding of the relevant biomechanics to identify the pertinent sensing parameters, concurrent treatment of sensing and powering aspects, and utilisation of energy harvesting for sensing and data transmission. While sensing advancements have contributed to the rise of real-time health monitoring in other fields of medicine, orthopaedics has so far been overlooked. It is the application of these innovations that will lead to the development of a new generation of 'smart' implants for continuous postoperative evaluation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To reduce falls, we must first understand how older adults maintain lateral balance while walking, particularly when their stability is challenged. We recently developed computational models of lateral stepping, based on Goal Equivalent Manifolds, that separate effects of step-to-step regulation from variability. These show walking humans seek to strongly maintain step width, but also lateral position on their path. Here, 17 healthy older (ages 60+) and 17 healthy young (ages 18-31) adults walked in a virtual environment with no perturbations and with laterally destabilizing perturbations of either the visual field or treadmill platform. For step-to-step time series of step widths and lateral positions, we computed variability, statistical persistence and how much participants directly corrected deviations at each step. All participants exhibited significantly increased variability, decreased persistence and tighter direct control when perturbed. Simulations from our stepping regulation models indicate people responded to the increased variability imposed by these perturbations by either maintaining or tightening control of both step width and lateral position. Thus, while people strive to maintain lateral balance, they also actively strive to stay on their path. Healthy older participants exhibited slightly increased variability, but no differences from young in stepping regulation and no evidence of greater reliance on visual feedback, even when subjected to substantially destabilizing perturbations. Thus, age alone need not degrade lateral stepping control. This may help explain why directly connecting gait variability to fall risk has proven difficult.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, prior biomechanical studies of these exoskeletons primarily focused on static overhead tasks. In this study, we evaluated how continuous passive anti-gravity assistance affects able-bodied neuromuscular activity and shoulder kinematics during dynamic and static phases of shoulder elevation movements. Subjects, seated upright, elevated the shoulder from a rest posture (arm relaxed at the side) to a target shoulder elevation angle of 90°. Subjects performed the movement in the frontal (abduction) and scapular (scaption) planes with and without passive anti-gravity assistance. Muscles that contribute to positive shoulder elevation, based on their reported moment arms, had significantly lower muscle activations with assistance during both dynamic and static elevation. Muscles that contribute to negative shoulder elevation, which can decelerate the shoulder during dynamic shoulder elevation, were not significantly different between assistance conditions. This may be partly explained by the trend of subjects to reduce their maximum angular decelerations near the target to offset the positive shoulder elevation moment due to the anti-gravity assistance. Our results suggest that passive anti-gravity assistance could reduce the muscle activations needed to perform dynamic movements. Consequently, the anti-gravity assistance of passive shoulder exoskeletons may enhance motor function and reduce muscle and joint loads for both able-bodied and disabled users.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

One hypothesis is that milk expression is due to the negative pressure applied by the infant sucking; the alternative hypothesis is that the tongue movement and squeezing of nipple/areola due to mouthing is responsible for the extraction of milk from the nipple. In this study, 3-D two-way Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations are conducted to investigate the factors that play the primary role in expressing milk from the nipple. The models include the solid deformation and periodic motion of the tongue and jaw movement. To obtain the boundary conditions, ultrasound images of the oral cavity and motion of the tongue movement during breastfeeding are extracted in parallel to the intra-oral vacuum pressure. The numerical results are cross-validated with clinical data. The results show that, while vacuum pressure plays an important role in the amount of milk removal, the tongue/jaw movement is essential for facilitating this procedure by decreasing the shear stress within the main duct in the nipple.

In this study, a finite element model of the left ventricle (LV) is proposed to calculate the mechanical response. The constitutive model of the LV is composed of a quasi-incompressible transversely isotropic model and an active contraction of the myocardium model. Pulsatile unloading is provided by the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which is implanted between the aortic root and aortic arch. Support models (constant speed and co-pulse) were utilized to study the effect of pulsatile unloading on intraventricular flow and ventricular stress. The result indicates that the formation time of the vortex increases under pulsatile unloading. The area rate of high time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) increased after pulsatile unloading. The area of the high oscillatory shear index (OSI) region (OSI > 0.375) was calculated for heart failure, constant speed, and co-pulse (9.9 cm2, 9.6 cm2, and 9.2 cm2, respectively). The maximum value of the stress that reflects the level of stretch declined after pulsatile unloading (66.4 kPa, 30.9 kPa, and 21.3 kPa, respectively). Besides, pulsatile unloading impacts the maximum value of thickness at the ventricular wall (-0.75 mm, -1 mm, and -1.25 mm, respectively). The change ratios of the thickness are 10%, 14%, and 17%, respectively. In conclusion, pulsatile unloading contributes to the distribution of intraventricular flow and the formation time of the vortex. Co-pulse support significantly reduces the maximum value of the ventricular wall stress and the area of high stress on the ventricular wall.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The glenohumeral joint of affected children can undergo severe osseous deformation and altered muscle properties, depending on location of the injury relative to the dorsal root ganglion (preganglionic or postganglionic). Preganglionic injury results in lower muscle mass and shorter optimal muscle length compared to postganglionic injury. We investigated whether these changes to muscle properties over time following BPBI provide a mechanically-driven explanation for observed differences in bone deformity between preganglionic and postganglionic BPBI. We developed a computational framework integrating musculoskeletal modeling to represent muscle changes over time and finite element modeling to simulate bone growth in response to mechanical and biological stimuli. The simulations predicted that the net glenohumeral joint loads in the postganglionic injury case were nearly 10.5% greater than in preganglionic. Predicted bone deformations were more severe in the postganglionic case, with the glenoid more declined (pre: -43.8°, post: -51.0°), flatter with higher radius of curvature (pre: 3.0 mm, post: 3.7 mm), and anteverted (pre: 2.53°, post: 4.93°) than in the preganglionic case. These simulated glenoid deformations were consistent with previous experimental studies. Thus, we concluded that the differences in muscle mass and length between the preganglionic and postganglionic injuries are critical mechanical drivers of the altered glenohumeral joint shape.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A full-body OpenSim® musculoskeletal model, constructed by combining existing lower- and upper-body models, was driven based on one volunteer's (female; age 25; 60.8 kg; 176 cm) anthropometrics and kinematics from a series of upright standing and straight-legged dynamic lifting tasks. The lumbar spine portion was modified in a step-wise manner to observe effects of: (1) RHY vs. DSX lumbar kinematics; (2) No disc (bushing) stiffness (NBS); generic, linear bushing stiffness (LBS); subject-specific nonlinear bushing stiffness (NLBS); (3) Upright standing (UP) vs. Supine (SUP) neutral state; (4) Weight lifted: 4.5 kg vs. 13.6 kg. L4L5 JRF from 24 model variations based on combinations of aforementioned parameters were compared. Rhythm-based kinematics without translational components tends to over-predict JRF (31% and 39% for compression and shear, respectively) compared to DSX-based kinematics. Additionally, differences due to accompanying passive stiffness and neutral state choice combinations were even larger (>50%), indicating heightened demand on the quality of these accompanying inputs. The study not only highlights model sensitivity to choices made regarding the three primary inputs-kinematics, passive stiffness and neutral state- separately, but also how interactions between these choices can result in significant variability in joint loading estimates.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Their use has become popular in the analysis of change of direction tasks to inform best practice in the prevention and rehabilitation of anterior cruciate ligament injury. As externally-placed markers define segment axes origins and orientations, kinematic and kinetic outputs from the CGM are sensitive to marker placement. The aim of this investigation was to quantify the sensitivity of lower extremity kinematics and knee moments to systematic differences in marker placement across the stance phase of a change of direction task. Systematic anterior/posterior displacements were applied to the lateral thigh, femoral epicondyle and tibia markers in software. One-dimensional statistical parametric mapping was used to determine the effect of marker placement across the entire stance phase of a 90° change of direction task. Marker placement error within previously reported inter-tester variability ranges caused significant differences in knee abduction moment, hip rotation angle, knee rotation angle, ankle abduction and rotation angle across various periods of stance. Discrete measures of these variables have been associated with increased frontal plane knee loading during change of direction, considered a key mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Systematic differences in marker placement may lead to incorrect group statistical inferences in such discrete measures.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that BW support would incur a greater and lower percentage of Net Metabolic Power (NMP) for uphill and downhill slopes, respectively, compared to level-ground walking. Additionally, we hypothesized that mass redirection would incur a greater and lower percentage of NMP for uphill and downhill slopes, respectively compared to level-ground walking. 10 subjects walked at 1.25 m/s on 0°, ±3°, and ±6° slopes with reduced/added weight and added mass while we measured metabolic rates. We calculated NMP per Newton of reduced BW at each slope and found that BW support required 58% and 64% of the NMP to walk at +3° and +6°, respectively, both greater than the 15% required for level-ground walking (p < 0.025). We calculated NMP per kg of added mass at each slope and found that mass redirection required 19% and 23% of the NMP to walk at +3° and +6°, respectively, both lower than the 35% required for level-ground walking (p < 0.025). We found no significant differences in the percentage of NMP for BW support or mass redirection during downhill compared to level ground walking (p > 0.05). Our findings elucidate that the percentage of NMP attributed to BW support and mass redirection is different for sloped compared to level-ground walking.

However, the inter-individual inconsistency in KAM changes with LWI limits their therapeutic use. Although the foot progression angle (FPA) has been frequently discussed in KAM modifications literature, there is a lack of data regarding a possible relationship between this gait measure and changes in KAM with LWI. This study aimed to test if KAM changes with LWI differ with respect to the natural FPA and to compare KAM-related variables between individuals walking with smaller and larger natural FPA. Twenty-two healthy participants (14 males, 24 ± 3 years, 22.7 ± 2.7 kg/m2) underwent gait analysis with and without LWI. They were divided into two groups based on their natural FPA, and changes in KAM 1st peak, KAM impulse, and KAM-related variables were compared between groups. KAM 1st peak and impulse decreased with LWI in the smaller natural FPA group (p ≤ 0.006), while only KAM impulse decreased in the larger natural FPA group (p < 0.001). The difference in KAM 1st peak changes was explained by a less reduced lever arm in participants walking with larger natural FPA. In conclusion, this study brought new insight into the variability in KAM response to LWI. If the findings are confirmed in patients with medial knee osteoarthritis, the FPA could become a simple measure to help identify the patients more likely to reduce their KAM with LWI.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous studies have shown that both knee-spanning and non-knee-spanning muscles contribute to tibiofemoral joint compressive forces during walking. However, healthy individuals typically engage in more vigorous activities (e.g. jumping and cutting) that provide greater challenges to tibiofemoral stability. Despite this, no previous studies have investigated how both knee-spanning and non-knee-spanning muscles contribute to tibiofemoral compressive loading during such tasks. The present study investigated how muscles contributed to the medial and lateral compartment tibiofemoral compressive forces during sidestep cutting. Three-dimensional marker trajectories, ground reaction forces and muscle electromyographic signals were collected from eight healthy males whilst they completed unanticipated sidestep cutting. OpenSim was used to perform musculoskeletal simulations to compute the contribution of each lower-limb muscle to compressive loading of each compartment of the knee. The greatest contributors to medial compartment loading were the vasti, gluteus maximus and medius, and the medial gastrocnemius. The greatest contributors to lateral compartment loading were the vasti, adductors, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and the soleus. The soleus displayed the greatest potential for unloading the medial compartment, whereas the gluteus maximus and medius displayed the greatest potential for unloading the lateral compartment. These findings may help to inform interventions aiming to modulate compressive loading at the knee.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, species-dependent functional biomechanics of a mouse penis, is not known. In this study, spatial mapping of a mechanosensitive transcription factor, scleraxis (Scx), at ages 4, 5, 6 weeks, and 1 year were generated to identify mechanoactive regions within penile tissues. Reconstructed volumes of baculum collected using micro X-ray computed tomography illustrated significantly increased baculum length with decreased porosity, and increased mineral density (p < 0.05) with age. The bony-baculum was held centrally in the Scx positive corpus cavernosum glandis (CCG), indicating mechanoactivity within the struts in a 6 week old mouse. The struts also were stained positive for fibrillar proteins including collagen and elastin, and globular proteins including protein gene product 9.5, and α-smooth muscle actin. The corpus cavernosum penis (CCP) contained significantly (p < 0.05) more collagen than CCG within the same penis, and both regions contained blood vessels with equivalent innervation at any given age. Comparison of volumes of flaccid and erect penile forms revealed functional characteristics of the CCP. Results of this study provided insights into biomechanical function of the CCG; in that, it is a high-pressure chamber that stiffens the penis and is similar to the human corpus cavernosum.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of two 6-week SS programs performed with different frequencies but generally the same duration of stretching on the passive properties of the medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon unit. The study participants comprised 24 male volunteers randomly assigned to either the one-time/week group or the three-times/week group, performing 6 min of SS once per week and 2 min of SS thrice per week, respectively. The dorsiflexion ROM (DF ROM) and muscle stiffness of the medial gastrocnemius during passive ankle dorsiflexion were assessed using a dynamometer and ultrasonography before and after 6 weeks of SS programs. The results show that the DF ROM was increased and muscle stiffness was decreased significantly in the three-times/week group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas no significant changes were observed in DF ROM and muscle stiffness in the one-time per week group (P = 0.25 and P = 0.32, respectively).

Thirty healthy young adults and 25 healthy elderly adults participated. All participants performed walking at their preferred speed and at a fast speed. Based on the margin of stability (MoS), balance during a gait cycle was divided into medial/lateral and anterior/posterior direction (ML/AP-MoS). Positive/negative integral values of ML-MoS were defined as ML-MoSPOS/ML-MoSNEG, and the average of AP-MoS over the gait cycle was defined as AP-MoSmean. The fast/preferred ratio of AP-MoSmean/ML-MoSPOS (AP-MoSmean (Fast/Preferred)/ML-MoSPOS (Fast/Preferred)) and the fast-preferred difference of ML-MoSNEG (ML-MoSNEG (Fast-Preferred)) were compared between groups. ML/AP-MoS at the preferred/fast gait was also compared between 12 gait events and groups. The Japanese version of the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (J-Mini-BESTest), the Japanese version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (J-ABC scale), and the number of falls in the past year were obtained from all subjects. ML-MoSPOS (Fast/Preferred), ML-MoSNEG (Fast-Preferred), and AP-MoSmean (Fast/Preferred) were significantly correlated with J-Mini-BESTest.

We adapted the Mode III trouser tear test to evaluate the energy required to tear the dentin ECM. Trouser-shaped dentin specimens from crown and root were demineralized. Depletion of GAGs and PGs followed enzymatic digestion using chondroitinase ABC (c-ABC) and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), respectively. The legs from specimen were stretched under tensile force and the load at tear propagation was determined to calculate the tear energy (T, kJ/m2). SLRPs decorin and biglycan were visualized by immunohistochemistry and ECM tear pattern was analyzed in SEM. Results showed T of crown ECM was not affected by PGs/GAGs depletion (p = 0.799), whereas the removal of PGs significantly reduced T in root dentin ECM (p = 0.001). Root dentin ECM exhibited higher T than crown (p < 0.03), however no regional difference are present after PG depletion (p = 0.480). Immunohistochemistry confirmed removal of GAGs and PGs. SEM images showed structural modifications after PGs/GAGs removal such as enlargement of dentinal tubules, increased interfibrillar spaces and presence of untwisted fibrils with increased diameter. Findings indicate that the capacity of the PGs to unfold and untwist contribute to the dentin ECM resistance to tear, possibly influencing crack growth propagation.

Twenty-six recreational runners were evaluated on a treadmill at 3.3 m/s. The coordination of the pelvis-lumbar and lumbar-thorax in all three planes and between the transverse and frontal plane of the lumbar segment were evaluated using the vector coding technique. Coordination was analyzed via histograms with the percentage of each pattern and the coupling angle during the cycle. The variability coordination was calculated from the angular deviation between the cycles. Differences were observed in the coordination patterns and in the coupling angle during the cycle. Between the pelvis-lumbar in the frontal plane, the LBPG (x¯ = 50.6% (SD = 10.7)) presented more in-phase pattern than the CG (38.6% (8.7; P = 0.05).

However, the characteristics of talocrural and subtalar joint kinematics in individuals with repetitive ankle sprains during locomotion is unclear. The purpose of this study was to quantify the differences of talocrural and subtalar joint kinematics between individuals with and without history of ankle sprains during the walking stance phase. Lateral fluoroscopic images from 10 participants with history of repetitive ankle sprains (AS group) and 8 healthy volunteers (Control group) were obtained between the time of heel contact and toe-off, and the three-dimensional bone orientations were determined using 3D-2D model-image registration techniques to compare the kinematic differences between the two groups. The AS group exhibited a greater talocrural internal rotation from heel contact to 60% of the stance phase than the control group. The results of this study indicate that ankles with repetitive sprains have different talocrural kinematics, and that greater talocrural internal rotation may become a factor in the development of ankle osteoarthritis.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the effective flexion angle in stretching for each adductor muscle remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hip flexion angle on muscle elongation of hip adductor muscles during stretching. Sixteen healthy men were recruited for this study. Shear elastic modulus, an index of muscle elongation, of the adductor longus (AL), and both the anterior and posterior adductor magnus (anterior AM) were measured using ultrasonic shear wave elastography at rest (supine position) and at 5 stretching positions (maximal hip abduction at 90°, 60°, 30°, 0°, and -15° hip flexion). For the AL, the shear elastic modulus at rest was significantly lower than that in all stretching positions. However, there was no significant difference among stretching positions. For the anterior AM, there was no significant difference between stretching positions and at rest. For the posterior AM, the shear elastic modulus in 90°, 60°, and 30° hip flexion were significantly higher than that at rest. The shear elastic modulus in 90° hip flexion was significantly higher than that in 60° and 30° hip flexion. Our results suggest that the AL is elongated to the same extent by maximal hip abduction regardless of hip flexion angle, the anterior AM is not elongated regardless of the hip flexion angle; the posterior AM is elongated at all angles except at 0° and -15° hip flexion and is most extended at 90° hip flexion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, current imaging methods are limited in characterizing very fast deformations of cells. This could be achieved with computational multiscale modeling, but current models accommodating collagen fibril networks and poroelastic ground matrix have included only a single cell. In this study, a workflow was developed for generating a three-dimensional multiscale model with imaging-based anatomical cell distributions and their micro-environment (pericellular and extracellular matrix). Fibril-reinforced poroelastic material models with (FRPES) and without (FRPE) swelling were implemented into the model and simulations were performed for evaluating cell deformations before and after experimental loading conducted for rabbit knee joint cartilage. We observed that the cells experienced considerably different deformation based on their location in all models. Both FRPE and FRPES models were able to predict the trends in the changes in cell deformations, although the average and median magnitudes differed between the model predictions and experiments. However, the FRPES model results were generally closer to the experimental results. Current findings suggest that morphological properties of cells are affected by the variations in the tissue properties between the samples and variations within the sample caused by the measurement geometry, local structure and composition. Thus, it would be important to consider the anatomical distribution and location of multiple cells along with the structure of fibril networks if cell deformation metrics are evaluated in collagenous tissues.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The purpose of this study was to determine which muscle forces and frontal plane biomechanical features contribute to large knee abduction moments. Thirteen young female athletes performed three drop vertical jump trials. Subject-specific musculoskeletal models and electromyography-informed simulations were developed to calculate the frontal plane biomechanics and lower limb muscle forces. The relationships between knee abduction moment and frontal plane biomechanics were examined. Knee abduction moment was positively correlated to vertical (R = 0.522, P < 0.001) and lateral ground reaction forces (R = 0.395, P = 0.016), hip adduction angle (R = 0.358, P < 0.023) and lateral pelvic tilt (R = 0.311, P = 0.061). A multiple regression showed that knee abduction moment was predicted by reduced gluteus medius force and increased vertical and lateral ground reaction forces (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.640). Hip adduction is indicative of lateral pelvic shift during landing. The coupled hip adduction and lateral pelvic tilt were associated to the increased vertical and lateral ground reaction forces, propagating into higher knee abduction moments. These biomechanical features are associated with ACL injury and may be limited in a landing with increased activation of the gluteus medius. Targeted neuromuscular training to control the frontal pelvic and hip motion may help to avoid injurious ground reaction forces and consequent knee abduction moment and ACL injury risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that weaker hip abductor muscle strength is more significantly associated with slowed turning speed than with the other TUG subtasks (STW and straight walking) after controlling for quadriceps muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Community-dwelling participants with knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence [K&L] grade ≥ 1; mean age, 68.6 years; 70.3% women) underwent laser-TUG. Spatiotemporal gait parameters in TUG and the TUG subtasks were evaluated as outcome measures. The isometric muscle strength of the hip abductor and quadriceps was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between muscle strength as an independent variable and spatiotemporal parameters as dependent variables. The relative importance of hip abductor muscle strength was determined using the percentages of unique variance. Participants with weaker hip abductor muscle strength demonstrated 0.094 m/s slower turning speed after adjustment for covariates including quadriceps muscle strength. The unique variance explained by hip abductor muscle strength in turning speed was 2.1%. However, no significant relationships were confirmed between weak hip abductor muscle strength and the time to perform TUG and the straight walking (forward and return) phase. These findings indicate that turning motion may be more sensitive to aggravated hip abductor muscle weakness and may show better response to hip muscle strengthening exercises.

In computational studies, it is important for the model to replicate realistic motion, as this affects the physiological fidelity of the model. Previous computational studies showed that accounting for the effect of the pericardium allows for a more realistic motion simulation. In this study, we describe the mechanism through which the pericardium causes improved cardiac motion. We simulated electrical activation and contraction of the ventricles on a four-chamber heart in the presence and absence of the effect of the pericardium. We simulated the mechanical constraints imposed by the pericardium by applying normal Robin boundary conditions on the ventricular epicardium. We defined a regional scaling of normal springs stiffness based on image-derived motion from CT images. The presence of the pericardium reduced the error between simulated and image-derived end-systolic configurations from 12.8±4.1 mm to 5.7±2.5 mm. First, the pericardium prevents the ventricles from spherising during isovolumic contraction, reducing the outward motion of the free walls normal to the surface and the upwards motion of the apex. Second, by restricting the inward motion of the free and apical walls of the ventricles the pericardium increases atrioventricular plane displacement by four folds during ejection. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation of the importance of the pericardium in physiological simulations of electromechanical cardiac function.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unlike running-specific prostheses, daily-use prostheses are not designed for running and may result in biomechanical differences that influence injury risk. To investigate these potential differences, we assessed the effect of amputation, prosthesis type, and running speed on joint work and ground reaction forces. 13 people with and without a unilateral TTA ran at speeds ranging from 2.5 m/s to 5.0 m/s. People with TTA ran using their own daily-use and running-specific prostheses. Body kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and used to compute joint work. People with TTA had smaller peak braking, propulsive and medial/lateral ground reaction forces from the amputated leg compared to people without TTA. People wearing running-specific prostheses had smaller peak amputated leg vertical ground reaction forces compared to daily-use prostheses at speeds above 3.5 m/s. Medial/lateral forces were also smaller in running-specific prostheses, which may present balance challenges when running on varied terrain. Running-specific prostheses stored and returned more energy and provided greater propulsion, resulting in more similar positive hip work between legs compared to daily-use prostheses. Increases in positive hip work, but not device work, highlight the importance of the hip in increasing running speed. Running-specific devices may be beneficial for joint health at running-speeds above 3.5 m/s and provide advantages in propulsion and energy return at all speeds compared to daily-use prostheses, helping people with TTA achieve faster running speeds.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Such validations were largely performed by comparing local strains at a small subset of points to the gold standard strain gauge (SG) measurements. A comprehensive full field validation of femoral FEAs including both strains and displacements using digital image correlation (DIC) full field measurements, especially at medial and lateral surfaces of the neck that experience the highest strains, provide new insights on femurs' mechanical behavior. Five cadaver femurs were loaded in stance position and monitored at the shaft and neck using two DIC systems simultaneously. DIC strains were compared to SG measurements at a limited number of locations so to corroborate DIC measurements by the gold standard technique. These were used to quantitatively assess the validity of FEA strains prediction especially at the neck where fracture usually occurs. Strains measured by DIC correspond well to the SG observations. An excellent agreement was observed between DIC and FEA predicted strains excluding the superior neck surface: FE=1.02×DIC-17,r2=0.977. At the superior neck however, strains were not well predicted by FEA models: Although the FEA predicted high strains at the 'saddle region', these were not observed experimentally. On the other hand, strain concentrations were measured by DIC at numerous vessel holes which were not represented by FE models. Since fractures usually initiate at the subcapital region in stance position ex-vivo experiments, where numerus vessel holes exist, these vessel holes may be required to be accounted for in future FE models so to allow a better estimation of the fracture load. Full field measurements are mandatory to allow a better validation of fracture load and location predictions which are of high clinical importance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

An earlier study (van Lenthe et al., 2008) found that beam theory leads to a considerable underestimation of the Young's modulus of mice femora. However, we hypothesized that beam theory might still be an accurate tool for the determination of bone strength from experimental data. The first goal was to test this hypothesis, along with checking if the underestimation of the tissue modulus is also valid for rat femurs. The second goal was to investigate if micro-FE and beam theory would yield similar increases in Young's moduli and yield stress during aging. Twelve rat femurs (12 and 16 weeks old) were scanned using micro-CT and subjected to a three-point bending test from which the bending stiffness and the yield force were obtained. The Young's modulus and yield stress then were calculated by regressing the experimental results with results obtained from beam theory and micro-FE analysis based on the micro-CT scans. It was found that bone strength calculated using beam theory overestimated that calculated from micro-FE by 8.0%. The Young's modulus did not significantly differ. When comparing age groups, similar increases in tissue modulus and yield strength were found for beam theory and micro-FE, with significant differences only for the micro-FE yield stress. We concluded that the use of beam theory to calculate bone yield strength from 3-point bending test results of rat femurs leads to its overprediction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty diabetic patients with mild-to-moderate neuropathy was recruited to this study. A total-contact insole was prototyped and vibratory motors were embedded into it. The parameters of the center of pressure (amplitude, velocity, and phase plane portrait) were analyzed after 30-minute walks with the shoe only, the shoe with vibro-medical insole with and without vibrations in eyes open and closed condition. The center of pressure amplitude, velocity, and phase plane portrait in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions were significantly decreased using a vibro-medical insole without vibration in the eyes open condition (p < 0.05), as compared to the shoe, and with vibro- medical insole with vibration in both eyes open and closed conditions (p < 0.05) compared to the shoe. A significant drop was observed in the center of pressure amplitude, velocity and phase plane portrait parameters when the vibro-medical insole with vibration was used compared to vibro- medical insole without vibration in eyes closed condition (p < 0.05). The use of vibro-medical insoles was found to improve the patient's balance control, as compared to the shoe. In the eyes closed condition, an improvement in the balance control was observed only with vibro-medical insole with vibration rather than vibro-medical insole without vibration or the shoe. Current finding suggest that a combination of the total-contact insole with vibration may improve the balance control remarkably in diabetic patients with mild-to-moderate neuropathy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As such there is a need to increase our understanding of the biomechanical function of the joint following partial and complete ACL injury during skeletal growth. In this work, we aimed to assess changes in knee kinematics and loading of the remaining soft tissues following both partial and complete ACL injury in a porcine model. To do so, we applied anterior-posterior tibial loads and varus-valgus moments to stifle joints of female pigs ranging from early juvenile to late adolescent ages and assessed both kinematics and in-situ loads carried in the bundles of the ACL and other soft tissues including the collateral ligaments and the menisci. Partial ACL injury led to increased anterior tibial translation only in late adolescence and small increases in varus-valgus rotation at all ages. Complete ACL injury led to substantial increases in translation and rotation at all ages. At all ages, the medial collateral ligament and the medial meniscus combined to resist the majority of applied anterior tibial load following complete ACL transection. Across all ages and flexion angles, the contribution of the MCL ranged from 45 to 90% of the anterior load and the contribution of the medial meniscus ranged from 14 to 35% of the anterior load. These findings add to our current understanding of age-specific functional properties of both healthy and injured knees during skeletal growth.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For actuated exoskeletons, support based on moments actively produced by the trunk muscles appears a viable approach. The moment can be estimated by a biomechanical model. However, one of the main challenges here is the feasibility of recording the required input variables (kinematics, EMG data, ground reaction forces) to run the model. The aim of this study was to evaluate how accurate different selections of input variables can estimate actively generated moments around L5/S1. Different multivariate regression analyses were performed using a dataset consisting of spinal load, body kinematics and trunk muscle activation levels during different lifting conditions with and without an exoskeleton. The accuracy of the resulting models depended on the number and type of input variables and the regression model order. The current study suggests that third-order polynomial regression of EMG signals of one or two bilateral back muscle pairs together with exoskeleton trunk and hip angle suffices to accurately estimate the actively generated muscle moment around L5/S1, and thereby design a proper control system for back support exoskeletons.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, independent of the magnitude of occupational spinal loading, twin studies find that the heritability of lumbar disc degeneration is 34-74%. This finding has led to intensive searches for susceptibility genes; some genes associated with disc degeneration have been identified, though all with small effects on the degenerative process. The complex nature of degenerative changes suggests that many different genes are involved, and that interactions with environmental factors are influential in progression of degeneration. Low back pain itself also appears heritable (30-46%). The most important clinical question though, is not how discs degenerate but is disc degeneration related to low back pain. Imaging studies find many people with degenerate discs or even with discs showing pathological features such as herniations, are asymptomatic. However results are obscured by the lack of consistent definitions of the phenotypes of disc degeneration and of low back pain. Epidemiological studies could help disentangle these complex relationships, but they will only be successful once consistent classifications and phenotypes of both disc degeneration and low back pain are developed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While IVD biomechanics are a key factor in the degenerative cycle, many mechanotransduction pathways remain unknown, in particular the electro-mechanical coupling in the loaded tissue. However, despite evidence for a role in the mechanically-induced remodelling of similar tissue, piezoelectricity has been overlooked in the IVD. In this study, we investigate the piezoelectric properties of the Annulus Fibrosus (AF) and the Nucleus Pulposus (NP) by measuring the direct piezoelectric effect of mechanically-induced electrical potential change. To verify these findings, we conducted Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) to measure the inverse effect of electrically-induced deformation. We demonstrate that, for the first time, piezoelectricity is generated throughout the IVD. Piezoelectric effects were greater in the AF than the NP, owing to the organised collagen networks present. However, the piezoresponse found in the NP indicates piezoelectric properties of non-collagenous proteins that have not yet been studied. The voltage generated by longitudinal piezoelectricity in-vivo has been calculated to be ~1 nV locally, indicating that piezoelectric effects may directly affect cell alignment in the AF and may work in conjunction with streaming potentials throughout the IVD. In summary, we have highlighted an intricate electro-mechanical coupling that appears to have distinct physiological roles in the AF and NP. Further study is required to elucidate the cell response and determine the potential role of piezoelectric effects in regeneration and preventative measures from degeneration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Within the bend sprinting literature, it is generally accepted that sprint performance on the bend is restricted by moments in the non-sagittal plane preventing the production of force in the sagittal plane. However, there is limited evidence in conditions representative of elite athletics performance that supports this hypothesis. Three-dimensional kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected from seven participants during sprinting on the bend (36.5 m radius) and straight, allowing calculation of joint moment, power and energy. No changes in extensor moment were observed at the hip and knee joints. Large effect sizes (g = 1.07) suggest a trend towards an increase in left step peak ankle plantarflexion moment. This could be due to a greater need for stabilisation of the ankle joint as a consequence of non-sagittal plane adaptations of the lower limb. In addition, the observed increase in peak MTP joint plantar-flexor moment might have implications for injury risk of the fifth metatarsal. Energy generation, indicated by positive power, in the sagittal plane at the MTP and ankle joints was moderately lower on the bend than straight, whilst increases in non-sagittal plane energy absorption were observed at the ankle joint. Therefore, energy absorption at the foot and ankle may be a key consideration in improving bend sprinting performance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, there is a lack of clarity on whether commonly reported outcome measures (such as peak joint moment) are sufficient to describe the extent of long-term functional deficits following AT rupture and repair. The present study conducted a comprehensive isokinetic evaluation of the Triceps surae complex in 12 participants who previously underwent AT rupture and repair. Testing occurred 4.4 (±2.6) years following surgery, and consisted of maximal isokinetic strength assessments of the plantarflexors at two angular velocities (30 and 60°∙s-1) with the knee in flexed and straight positions. Differences between injured and non-injured limbs were tested through discrete and statistical parametric mapping analysis. Average joint moment showed significant main effects between injured and non-injured limbs, but common isokinetic parameters such as peak moment and angle of peak moment did not. The normalised moment curves showed a significant main effect of limb, angular velocity and knee joint position on joint moment throughout different portions of the range of motion. Temporal analysis revealed a significantly greater ability of the non-injured limb to sustain plantarflexor moments across a range of testing conditions. Participants who had undergone operative treatment of AT ruptures did not display inter-limb differences in discrete isokinetic strength outcomes that are often used in the literature. Instead, temporal analyses were required to highlight the reduced capacity of the injured limb to generate end-range joint moments and to sustain higher levels of joint moment for longer periods.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although LBP is more prevalent in females, sex-specific responses have not been well documented. Therefore, the purpose was to explore sex-specific neuromuscular differences, to gait perturbation, in LBP patients. Twenty-nine LBP patients (12m/17f;31 ± 10yrs; 174 ± 12 cm; 71 ± 16 kg) walked on a split-belt treadmill at 1 m/s, while 15 right-sided random perturbations (treadmill-belt decelerating, 40 m/s2, 50 ms duration; 200 ms after heel contact) were applied. Muscle activity was assessed using a 12-lead surface EMG (6 back/6 abdominal muscles; 4000 Hz). EMG-RMS [%] (0-200 ms after perturbation) was calculated and normalized to RMS of unperturbed gait for each muscle. Furthermore, muscle onsets (ms) were determined. Two-way ANOVA (factors: sex/muscle) was applied to account for sex differences in main outcomes. EMG-RMS (amplitudes; mean) ranged from 356% to 901% in males and 349% to 694% in females representing a significant interaction effect (sex * muscle: p = 0.017).

In the time domain, females showed overall, shorter (mean: 90 ± 16 ms) response times compared to males (mean: 98 ± 22 ms, sex effect: p < 0.0001). In this LBP population, abdominal muscle activation discriminated females from males. Specifically, females had higher activity of the rectus abdominis muscles and lower activation of the externus oblique muscles.

The aim of this study was to assess how joint angle configuration affects subtendon displacement and strain of soleus (SOL) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles. Knots sutured onto SOL and LG subtendons of 12 Wistar rats, were videotaped to quantify displacements and the ankle torque was assessed for different isometric activation conditions (i.e., individual and simultaneous) of the triceps surae muscles. Changing ankle and knee joint angle affected the magnitude of displacement, relative displacement and strain of both SOL and LG subtendons. SOL subtendon behavior was not only affected by changes in ankle angle, but also by changes in knee angle. Displacement of SOL subtendon decreased (28-49%), but strain increased in response to knee extension. Independent of joint angle configuration, stimulation of any combination of the muscles typically resulted in displacements and strains of LG and SOL subtendons. Typically SOL displaced more but LG displaced more when stimulated at longer muscle lengths. Our results demonstrate that the distinct subtendons of the Achilles tendon can move and deform differently, but are not fully independent. Within the AT, there appears to be a precarious balance between sliding allowance and mechanical connectivity between subtendons.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty individuals with chronic stroke walked overground during a 10-meter walk test to determine their self-selected (SS) speeds before walking on a treadmill in its fixed-speed (FSTM) and UDTM control modes at their SS and fastest comfortable (Fast) speeds. Paired t-tests were used to compare the walking speeds, peak AGRF, peak PGRF, and TLA among test conditions (α = 0.05). Participants selected similar SS (p > 0.05) and faster Fast walking speeds (p < 0.05) with the UDTM control compared to the FSTM control. There were no changes in their peak AGRF or PGRF for either limb or speed between UDTM and FSTM conditions (p > 0.05). Individuals used greater paretic TLA at SS speeds with UDTM control (p < 0.05). There was no difference in the AGRF required at Fast speeds with FSTM and UDTM control even though participants selected faster speeds with UDTM control. In work with young, healthy adults, we found that the treadmill control condition did not affect the amount of forward propulsion needed. Therefore, it is likely that when walking with UDTM control, individuals poststroke adjust their posture to make better use of their forward propulsion. This means they can reach faster walking speeds without increasing their push-off forces. Future work should assess how to most effectively prescribe UDTM control for gait training programs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To a biaxial hip joint simulator that incorporated flexion-extension (FE, range 46°) and abduction-adduction (AA, range 12°), a third motion component, inward-outward rotation (IOR, range 12°) was added according to the ISO 14242-1 standard. Due to the addition of the IOR, the wear rate of vitamin E stabilized, extensively cross-linked polyethylene (VEXLPE) liners decreased by 50 per cent. This was probably attributable to the increased linearity of the relative motion in the stance phase, caused by the simplified motion waveforms and their relative phases specified in the standard.

Uncertainty on the effects of cervical muscle properties on head injury risk may be due to the limitations of previous observational studies. This simulation study employs a musculoskeletal model of the head and neck to investigate the effect of several factors related to head injury metrics in American Football. These factors include isometric muscle strength, the eccentric multiplier (which is related to the athlete's ability to apply greater muscle force during eccentric contractions), posture, muscle activation patterns, and impact properties. Impact properties were based on the literature and tuned to reproduce peak linear and rotational accelerations of the skull. We hypothesized that active neck muscles significantly reduce head injury metrics. We systematically altered each model parameter to test our hypothesis. We then determined which model parameters affect head injury metrics the most. The results of this study indicate that active neck muscles have a statistically significant effect on head injury metrics. Increasing muscle strength and eccentric multiplier also resulted in a statistically significant reduction of head injury metrics. However, posture prior to impact had a much stronger effect than any other factor on head injury metrics. A comprehensive approach to athlete training protocols is recommended, including exercises aimed at increasing eccentric muscle strength and preparation for impacts. Future studies should investigate how targeted muscle strengthening and impact training (i.e. activation patterns and posture) modifies risk.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, there is an increasing number of voices challenging the suitability of quadrupeds, as the obvious postural differences give reason to presume significant differences in the spinal kinematics compared to humans. Rather, it is often questioned if primates did not represent the more suitable experimental animals due to their ability to bipedal walking. Both perspectives, however, have never been systematically addressed. Therefore, the present paper reviews the existing literature on in vivo spinal kinematics of quadrupeds, primates and humans during walking and critically discusses the comparability between these species. Surprisingly, no studies were found for sheep, pigs or goats. Instead, the literature search yielded 50 studies on quadrupeds, horses (n = 37) and dogs (n = 13), primates (n = 10) and humans (n = 61). In general, the kinematic data revealed a high level of heterogeneity and often demonstrated methodological deficits, e.g., insufficient number of measured animals. More kinematic variables were comparable between humans and quadrupeds than between humans and primates. Differences in spinal characteristics, however, could also be found amongst quadrupeds themselves (horse vs. dog). In conclusion, using of a particular animal species as a model for spine research requires its characterization. Cross-species extrapolations are ineligible. Furthermore, the review revealed significant differences between the bipedal walk of primates and humans. The gait alone thus does not constitute a valid argument for the superiority of primates over quadrupeds as experimental animal models for human spine research.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Most studies on identification of stair fall risk factors are limited to staircases set in given step dimensions. However, it remains unknown whether the conclusions drawn would still apply if the dimensions had been changed to represent more challenging or easier step dimensions encountered in domestic and public buildings. The purpose was to investigate whether the self-selected biomechanical stepping behaviours are maintained when the dimensions of a staircase are altered. Sixty-eight older adults (>65 years) negotiated a seven-step staircase set in two step dimensions (shallow staircase: rise 15 cm, going 28 cm; steep staircase: rise 20 cm, going 25 cm). Six biomechanical outcome measures indicative of stair fall risk were measured. K-means clustering profiled the overall stair-negotiating behaviour and cluster profiles were calculated. A Cramer's V measured the degree of association in membership between clusters. The cluster profiles revealed that the biomechanically risky and conservative factors that characterized the overall behaviour in the clusters did not differ for the majority of older adults between staircases for ascent and descent. A strong association of membership between the clusters on the shallow staircase and the steep staircase was found for stair ascent (Cramer's V: 0.412, p < 0.001) and descent (Cramer's V: 0.380, p = 0.003).

This study attempted to compare the motion contributions of adjacent lumbar levels during an active weight bearing flexion and return protocol in chronic, non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) patients and controls using quantitative fluoroscopy (QF). Eight CNSLBP patients received QF during guided standing lumbar flexion. Dynamic motion sharing of segments from L2 to S1 were calculated and analysed for interactions between levels. Eight asymptomatic controls were then matched to the 8 patients for age and sex and their motion sharing patterns compared. Share of intersegmental motion was found to be consistently highest at L2-L3 and L3-L4 and lowest at L5-S1 throughout the motion in both groups, with the exception of maximum flexion where L4-L5 received the greatest share. Change in motion sharing occurred throughout the flexion and return motion paths in both participant groups but tended to vary more at L4-L5 in patients (p < 0.05). In patients, L5-S1 provided less angular range (p < 0.05) and contributed less at maximum bend (p < 0.05), while L3-L4, on average over the bending sequence, provided a greater share of motion (p < 0.05). Intervertebral motion sharing inequality is therefore a normal feature during lumbar flexion. However, in patients, inequality was more pronounced, and variability of motion share at some levels increased. These effects may result from differences in muscular contraction or in the mechanical properties of the disc.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study investigated direct muscle electrical stimulation as a method to assess isometric force production in AbH about the 1st metatarsal phalangeal joint (1MPJ) at different muscle-tendon lengths, with the aim of identifying an optimal angle for force production. A 7 s stimulation train was delivered at 20 Hz pulse frequency and sub-maximal (150% motor threshold) intensity to the AbH of the left foot in 16 participants whilst seated, and with the Hallux suspended from a force transducer in 0°,5°,10°,15° and 20° 1MPJ dorsal flexion. Reflective markers positioned on the foot and force transducer were tracked with 5 optical cameras to continuously record the force profile and calculate the external 1MPJ joint flexion moment at each joint configuration. A parabolic relationship was found between AbH force production and 1MPJ configuration. The highest 1MPJ joint moments induced by electrical stimulation were found between 10° and 15° of Hallux dorsal flexion. However, the joint angle (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.86) changed significantly across all but one 1MPJ configurations tested during the stimulation-evoked contraction, resulting in a significant change in the corresponding external moment arm (p < 0.001; η2 = 0.83). Therefore, the changes in joint geometry during contraction should be accounted for to prevent an underestimation of the resulting joint moment. We conclude that direct muscle electrical stimulation combined with dynamometry offers a robust method for standardised assessment of AbH sub-maximal isometric force production.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the optimal patient-specific alignment often remains unknown. Statistical models could provide information about physiological alignments, and musculoskeletal models are powerful tools to investigate biomechanics. We aimed to statistically predict alignments and hypothesized they would be biomechanically favorable. A statistical model was trained with 60 annotated radiographs to predict physiological sagittal alignment based on position of femoral heads and sacrum. Predicted alignments for 11 back pain patients were clinically evaluated in terms of balance and compared to Original alignments. The normative ranges for spinal balance parameters were obtained from Surgimap™. Musculoskeletal loads were furthermore simulated in upright standing and 30° forward flexion, using alignment-specific musculoskeletal models. For the majority of Predicted alignments (n = 9) at least two of three investigated balance parameters were within the normative range, as opposed to the minority of the Original alignments (n = 4). Predicted alignments resulted in significantly lowered overall muscle activity and compressive loads (all levels, both postures). Shear force magnitudes in upright standing decreased significantly at levels L1L2 (-68 N) and L2L3 (-69 N) and clearly yet not significantly at L3L4 (-39 N) and L4L5 (-152 N). Shear loads at level L5S1 remained the same. In flexed postures identical trends were observed. The statistical model was able to predict spinal alignments that led to both improved balance and reduced musculoskeletal loads.

The ground reaction forces can be accurately estimated by experimental measurements using force platforms. However, the number of steps is limited by the number of force platforms available in the laboratory. Several numerical methods have been proposed to estimate the ground reaction forces without force platforms, i.e., solely based on kinematic data combined with a model of the foot-ground contact. The purpose of this work is to provide a more efficient method, using a unilaterally constrained model of the foot at the center of pressure to compute the ground reaction forces. The proposed model does not require any data related with the compliance of the foot-ground contact and is kept as simple as possible. The indeterminacy in the force estimation is handled using a least square approach with filtering. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) between the numerical estimations and experimental measurements are 4.1% for the vertical component of the ground reaction forces (GRF), 11.2% for the anterior component and 5.3% for the ground reaction moment (GRM) in the sagittal plane.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

So far, it remains unclear how the non-periodicity of blood flow would influence local hemodynamic parameters, especially wall shear stress (WSS) that associates closely with endothelial function and vascular disease. In this study, numerical simulations of blood flows in sixteen normal carotid artery bifurcations were performed under measured non-periodic and averaged periodic flow conditions, respectively, with the obtained results being compared in terms of five typical WSS metrics (i.e., mean WSS (MWSS), time-averaged WSS (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), transverse WSS (transWSS), and average temporal gradient of WSS (WSSTG)) in the atheroprone low-WSS regions. It was found that simplifying the physiologically non-periodic flow condition into a periodic one did not significantly alter the major features of WSS distribution, but resulted in underestimations of some WSS metrics. Specifically, the degree of underestimation was largest (27.2% ± 8.3%) for WSSTG, smallest (0.5% ± 0.4%) for MWSS, while moderate (5.1% ± 3.2% ~ 9.2% ± 4.1%) for other WSS metrics. Statistical analyses revealed that the cycle-to-cycle variability of flow velocity waveform (var-V) and the planarity of internal carotid artery correlated strongly with the periodic flow assumption-induced underestimations of WSS metrics. These findings suggest that taking the non-periodic characteristic of blood flow into consideration could be important for studying hemodynamics in arteries with a large var-V or specific morphological characteristics, especially when WSSTG is the main hemodynamic parameter of concern.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Gathering postural sway measures outside of controlled environments is desirable for reaching populations with limited mobility. Previous studies have confirmed the accuracy of the magnitude of postural sway using the Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB). However, it is unclear if the WBB can accurately measure persistence of postural sway, i.e., the pattern of center-of-pressure fluctuations over time. The purpose of this study was to compare measures of persistence of postural sway (through detrended fluctuation analysis) using WBB and a force platform (FP). Seventeen healthy individuals performed three standing conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, and one-leg standing. The WBB (30 Hz) was placed on top on the FP (600 Hz) to collect data simultaneously, then the FP data were downsampled to 100 Hz and 30 Hz. The agreement between WBB and FP for measures of postural sway were influenced by the sampling rate and postural sway direction. Intraclass correlation coefficient was excellent (range: 0.953-0.998) for long-term scaling regions in the anterior-posterior direction, but lower (range: 0.352-0.877) and inconsistent for medial-lateral direction and short-term scaling regions. The three comparison groups (WBB at 30 Hz, FP at 30 Hz, and FP at 100 Hz) showed dissimilar abilities in detecting differences in persistence of postural sway. In summary, the WBB is accurate for quantifying persistence of postural sway measurements in long-term scaling regions in the AP direction, but has limitations for short-term scaling regions and the ML direction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We hypothesized that testing conditions, specifically the presence of an observer, influences patient behaviors and resultant outcomes may overestimate their true walking capacity. This potential Hawthorne effect on spatiotemporal and biomechanical measures of locomotor function in individuals post-stroke has not been assessed previously. Fifteen ambulatory individuals with chronic stroke wore instrumented insoles and performed two separate normal-pace walking assessments, including unobserved conditions during which participants were unattended and unaware of data collection, and observed conditions with an investigator present. Gait analysis was conducted outside of a laboratory setting using instrumented insoles equipped with a 3D accelerometer and pressure sensors which captured the spatiotemporal kinematics, vertical ground reaction forces and foot acceleration. Data were compared using paired comparisons, with subsequent correlation and stepwise regression analyses to explore potential associations between Hawthorne-induced changes in walking strategies, gait speed and locomotor performance (daily stepping). Except for cadence, other measures of spatiotemporal parameters and swing kinematics (acceleration) were not significantly different between observed vs unobserved conditions. However, analyses of ground reaction forces revealed significantly greater paretic limb loading (Δ1st peak = 1.5 ± 1.6 N/kg Δ2nd peak = 1.4 ± 1.8 N/kg; p < 0.01) and increases in weight bearing symmetry (11-24%, p < 0.01) during observed vs unobserved conditions. This potential Hawthorne effect was greater in those with slower walking speeds and shorter stride lengths but was not related to daily stepping. The present findings suggest that biomechanical parameters of walking function may be related to the presence of an observer and highlight the need to separately measure locomotor capacity (gait speed) and performance (daily stepping).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fifty healthy adults (aged between 19 and 67 years, 28 males) participated in this study. Trunk motor control was assessed using force-controlled perturbations directly applied to the trunk. Admittance (inverse of lumped intrinsic and reflexive impedance) decreased with age and tended to be lower in females than males. The age effect on admittance was due to increasing intrinsic stiffness and damping with age, while intrinsic damping and position- and velocity feedback gains were lower in females than males. Feedback delays were not dependent on age. The decrease of trunk admittance with age is most likely due to increasing levels of antagonistic co-activation. Trunk admittance was (just) not significantly different between females and males, in spite of lower feedback gains and damping, possibly due to differences in trunk mass between sexes. These results imply that age and sex differences should be considered when assessing the relationship between back pain and trunk motor control.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, they do not account for the effect of continuously-varying task intensities on muscular recovery from a fatigued state. In this work, we propose and evaluate three continuous functions for modelling recovery to replace a dichotomous step-function in the three-compartment controller (3CC-r) model of muscle fatigue (Looft et al., 2018) and validate their predictions with previously collected data in the literature for intermittent and sustained isometric tasks of the ankle joint performed at different intensities. When compared to experimental data the accuracy of one of the three proposed models of recovery is found to be nearly the same as that yielded by the original step-function, but this seemingly-identical accuracy may be a limitation of the dataset used. A superelliptical curve relating recovery factor to task intensity is proposed to be the closest replacement for the step function as it depicts both the elevated value of recovery factor for near-rest activities as well as a nearly-constant value for low-to-high-intensity tasks.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unfortunately, differentiation amplifies the high frequency noise inherent within the signal hampering the accuracy of signal derivatives. A low-pass Butterworth filter is commonly used to reduce the sampled signal noise prior to differentiation. One hurdle lies in selecting an appropriate filter cut-off frequency which retains the signal of interest while reducing deleterious noise. Most biomechanics data processing approaches utilize the same cut-off frequency for the whole sampled signal, but the frequency components of a signal can vary with time. To accommodate such signals, the Automatic Segment Filtering Procedure (ASFP) is proposed which uses different automatically determined Butterworth filter cut-off frequencies for separate segments of a sampled signal. The Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator of the signal is computed and used to determine segments of the signal with different energy content. The Autocorrelation-Based Procedure (ABP) is used on each of these segments to determine filter cut-off frequencies. This new procedure was evaluated by estimating acceleration values from the test data set of Dowling (1985). The ASFP produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 16.4 rad s-2 (26.6%) whereas a single ABP determined filter cut-off frequency applied to the whole Dowling (1985) signal, representing the common approach, produced a RMSE of 25.5 rad s-2 (41.4%). As a point of comparison, a Generalized Cross-Validated Quintic Spline, a common non-Butterworth filter, produced a RMSE of 23.6 rad s-2 (38.4%). This new automatic approach is advantageous in biomechanics for preserving high frequency content of non-stationary signals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Since no noninvasive method can directly estimate spinal loads, easy-to-use regression equations that are constructed based on the results of complex musculoskeletal models appear as viable alternatives. Thus, we aim to develop subject-specific regression equations of L4-L5 and L5-S1 shear and compression forces during various symmetric/asymmetric tasks using a nonlinear personalized finite element musculoskeletal trunk model. Kinematics and electromyography (EMG) activities of 19 young healthy subjects were collected during 64 different symmetric/asymmetric tasks. To investigate the reliability and accuracy of the musculoskeletal model and regression equations, we compared estimated trunk muscle activities and L4-L5 intradiscal pressures (IDPs) respectively with our own electromyography data (EMGs) and reported in vivo pressure measurements. Although in general, six independent rotation components (three trunk T11 rotations and three pelvic S1 rotations) are required to determine kinematics along the spine, only two surrogate variables (trunk flexion and its asymmetric angles) satisfactorily predicted all six rotation components (R2 > 0.94). Regression equations, developed based on subject-specific inputs, predicted spinal loads in satisfactory agreement with IDP measurements (R2 = 0.85). Predicted muscle activities in the personalized musculoskeletal models were in moderate to weak agreements with our measured EMGs in 19 participants. Based on dominance analysis, trunk flexion and its asymmetry angle, hand-load weight, hand-load lever arm, and body weight were the most important variables while the effects of body height and sex on spinal loads remained small.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this study was to describe and compare the intravaginal pressure profile using a multisensor device along the vaginal length in women with and without urinary incontinence (UI), while performing pelvic floor muscle tasks. Fifty-four adult pre-menopausal women (31 continent and 23 incontinent) participated in this cross-sectional observational cohort study. The intravaginal pressure profile was assessed at rest, during maximum and sustained pelvic floor muscle contractions, using the Pliance® multisensor device. Between-group comparisons were performed considering the overall pressure and the pressure profile of 10-subregions along the vaginal length. In the overall pressure assessment, women with UI presented lower pressures at rest, similar pressures during maximum contraction and lower capacity to maintain pressure during sustained contraction compared to those in the continent group. The pressure profile assessment showed between-group differences that were consistent throughout tasks, with the incontinent group presenting lower pressures than the continent group, specifically in the mid-vaginal length, around 3-4 cm from the vaginal opening. We observed consistent deficits in pressure generation in incontinent compared to continent women, precisely in the region of the pelvic floor muscles.

However, this approach does not consider the full kinematic data waveform and its dynamic information, potentially exposing the analysis to bias. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) has been introduced and applied to 1 dimensional (D) kinematic variables allowing the assessment of data over time. The aims of this study were to assess differences in 3D kinematics patterns in people with and without LBP during functional tasks by using SPM and to investigate if SPM analysis was consistent with standard 3D range of motion (RoM) assessments. 3D joints kinematics of the spine and lower limbs were compared between 20 healthy controls and 20 participants with non-specific LBP during walking, sit-to-stand and lifting. SPM analysis showed significant differences in the 3Dkinematics of the lower thoracic segment, upper and lower lumbar segment and knee joint during walking and lifting mostly observed at the beginning and/or towards the end of the tasks. ROMs differed between groups in the lower thoracic segment (walking/sit-to-stand), upper and lower lumbar segments (walking/sit-to-stand/lifting), hip and knee (sit-to-stand/lifting). Based on these results, the two approaches can yield different data interpretations. SPM analysis allows the identification of differences in movement that occur over time.

Quantifying the effects of these changes on internal IVD strains may lead to better preventative strategies and treatments. Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) is a non-invasive technique that divides volumetric images into subsets, and measures strains by tracking the internal patterns within them under load. Applying DVC to MRIs may allow non-invasive strain measurements. However, DVC-MRI for strain measurements in IVDs has not been used previously. The purpose of this study was to quantify the strain and deformation errors associated with DVC-MRI for measurements in human IVDs. Eight human lumbar IVDs were MRI scanned (9.4 T) for a 'zero-strain study' (multiple unloaded scans to quantify noise within the system), and a loaded study (2 mm axial compression). Three DVC methodologies: Fast-Fourier transform (FFT), direct correlation (DC), and a combination of both FFT and DC approaches were compared with subset sizes ranging from 8 to 88 voxels to establish the optimal DVC methodology and settings which were then used in the loaded study. FFT + DC was the optimal method and a subset size of 56 voxels (2520 µm) was found to be a good compromise between errors and spatial resolution. Displacement and strain errors did not exceed 28 µm and 3000 microstrain, respectively.

Kinematic analyses are necessary to compare the intact condition (IC) with alterations after TDA to develop better prostheses. A well-established 6D measuring apparatus (resolution < 2.4 μm; 400 positions/cycle) was used.

Quantifying the effect of such focal in vivo fatigue-induced microdamage on the mechanical response of the tissue is critical for the understanding of joint surface injury and the development of osteoarthritis. Thus, we aimed to quantify the mechanical properties of cartilage-bone from equine third metacarpal (MC3) condyles, which is a common area of accumulated microdamage due to repetitive impact loading. We chose a non-destructive technique, i.e. high-resolution microcomputed tomography (µCT) imaging, to identify various degrees of in vivo microdamage in SCB prior to mechanical testing; because µCT imaging can only identify a proportion of accumulated microdamage, we aimed to identify racing and training history variables that provide additional information on the prior loading history of the samples. We then performed unconfined high-rate compression of approximately 2% strain at 45%/s strain rate to simulate a cycle of gallop and used real-time strain measurements using digital image correlation (DIC) techniques to find the stiffness and shock absorbing ability (relative energy loss) of the cartilage-bone unit, and those associated with cartilage and SCB. Results indicated that stiffness of cartilage-bone and those associated with the SCB decreased with increasing grade of damage. Whole specimen stiffness also increased, and relative energy loss decreased with higher TMD, whereas bone volume fraction of the SCB was only associated negatively with the stiffness of the bone. Overall, the degree of subchondral bone damage observed with µCT was the main predictor of stiffness and relative energy loss of the articular surface of the third metacarpal bone of Thoroughbred racehorses under impact loading.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While MoCap is accurate and reliable, it is impractical for assessment outside the laboratory. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) may be useful in these situations. Before IMUs are used as a surrogate for MoCap, methods that are reliable, repeatable, and that calculate metrics at similar accuracy to MoCap must be demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to compare spatiotemporal gait parameters and knee range of motion calculated via MoCap to IMU-derived variables and to compare the ability of these tools to discriminate between groups. MoCap and IMU data were collected from young, older, and adults with knee osteoarthritis during overground walking at three self-selected speeds. Walking velocity, stride length, cadence, percent of gait cycle in stance, and sagittal knee range of motion were calculated and compared between tools (MoCap and IMU), between participant groups, and across speed. There were no significant differences between MoCap and IMU outcomes, and root mean square error between tools was ≤0.05 m/s for walking velocity, ≤0.07 m for stride length, ≤0.5 strides/min for cadence, ≤5% for percent of gait cycle in stance, and ≤1.5° for knee range of motion. No interactions were present, suggesting that MoCap and IMU calculated metrics similarly across groups and speeds. These results demonstrate IMUs can accurately calculate spatiotemporal variables and knee range of motion during gait in young and older, asymptomatic and knee osteoarthritis cohorts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This layer consists of two relatively distinct sub-layers; a mucus layer (ML), and a periciliary liquid layer (PCL). In addition, the airways are lined with a dense mat of hair-like structures, called cilia, which beat back and forth in a co-ordinated manner and mainly propel the mucus layer. Such interaction between the cilia and mucus is called 'muco-ciliary clearance' (MCC) which is essential to clear the respiratory airways from the inhaled toxic particles deposited on the mucus. The complex nature of lung clearance mechanisms limit the ability to conduct experiments to investigate micro-scale physiological phenomena. As such, modelling techniques are commonly implemented to investigate the effects of biological parameters on the lung muco-ciliary clearance. In the present work, modelling techniques of cilia-ASL interactions - including continuum cilia modelling and discrete cilia modelling - are reviewed and the numerical procedures and level of complexity related to each technique are explained. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the airway surface liquid modelling approaches. In addition, findings of numerical investigations related to the effects of various parameters such as ciliary beat frequency (CBF), mucus rheology, metachronal waves of cilia, surface tension at the PCL-mucus interface, ciliary length, ciliary density, and airway surface liquid depth on the bronchial and tracheal ASL transport are reviewed. This review also explains how these biological parameters can alter the internal power required to perform ciliary beating. Lastly, the main limitations of current numerical works are discussed and significant research directions are brought forward that may be considered in future models to better understand this complex human biological system and its vital clearance mechanism.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although the high degree of inter-individual variation that exists in musculoskeletal geometry is associated with shoulder injuries, there is limited research associating the effects of muscle geometry on the potential stabilizing capacities of shoulder muscles. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the stabilizing functions of the scapulohumeral muscles using computational modeling and to quantify the sensitivity of muscle stabilizing roles to changes in muscle geometry. Muscle stability ratios in the superior/inferior and anterior/posterior directions were computed as the ratio between the muscle's shear components relative to compression throughout arm elevation in the scapular plane. Muscle attachment locations on the clavicle, scapula, and humerus were iteratively adjusted using Monte Carlo simulations. Consistent with previous experimental studies, the rotator cuff muscles were identified as the primary stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint; whereas the deltoids and coracobrachialis have a strong potential for superiorly translating the humerus at low elevation angles. Variations in the stability ratios due to altered muscle geometry were muscle- and angle-specific. In general, the highest variation was observed for the subscapularis and deltoids (at low elevation angles), while the remaining rotator cuff muscles largely maintained their capacity to provide compressive stabilizing forces at the glenohumeral joint. Changes in muscle stability ratios may affect dynamic stability of the humerus that could differentially predispose individuals to greater risk for injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While prior work suggests obesity influences postural stability during standing, little is known about how obesity affects walking stability. Therefore, this study compared walking stability in older adults with and without obesity. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to evaluate the associations between measures of body habitus and gait stability as well as the association between prospective stumbles and falls and gait stability. A total of 34 older adults (17 with obesity, 17 with normal weight) walked on a treadmill at a self-selected speed. Walking stability was quantified as the local dynamic stability of the trunk in all three planes of motion. Participants also performed a series of functional tests, and were followed for a one-year period during which they reported falls and stumbles. Although participants with obesity performed significantly worse than participants without obesity on most functional tests, there were no differences in stability between groups in any direction (p = 0.18-0.78; η2 = 0.003-0.056), nor between those with and without a prospective fall or stumble (p = 0.18-0.93; η2 = 0.003-0.054). There were significant, albeit weak, correlations between BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio and walking instability (p = 0.027-0.042; ρ = 0.36-0.39). Increased body mass, in absence of other obesity-related comorbidities, may have minimum impact on walking stability and in turn fall risk in older adults.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

To correctly simulate body hemodynamics, the viscoelastic properties of vessels walls are a key aspect to be taken into account as they play an essential role in cardiovascular behavior. The present work aims to apply the augmented fluid-structure interaction system of blood flow to real case studies to assess the validity of the model as a valuable resource to improve cardiovascular diagnostics and the treatment of pathologies. Main contributions of the paper include the evaluation of viscoelastic tube laws, estimation of viscoelastic parameters and comparison of models with literature results and in-vivo experiments. The ability of the model to correctly simulate pulse waveforms in single arterial segments is verified using literature benchmark test cases, designed taking into account a simple elastic behavior of the wall in the upper thoracic aorta and in the common carotid artery. Furthermore, in-vivo pressure waveforms, extracted from tonometric measurements performed on four human common carotid arteries and two common femoral arteries, are compared to numerical solutions. It is highlighted that the viscoelastic damping effect of arterial walls is required to avoid an overestimation of pressure peaks. Finally, an effective procedure to estimate the viscoelastic parameters of the model is herein proposed, which returns hysteresis curves of the common carotid arteries dissipating energy fractions in line with values calculated from literature hysteresis loops in the same vessel.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, experimental methods, reporting of results, and levels of the spine tested vary widely, and a comprehensive assessment of moment-rotation response across all levels of the spine is lacking. This review aims to characterize moment-rotation response in a consistent manner for all levels of the human spine. A literature search was conducted in PubMed for moment versus rotation data from mechanical testing of intact human cadaveric intervertebral joint specimens in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. A total of 45 studies were included, providing data from testing of an estimated 1,648 intervertebral joints from 518 human cadavers. We used mixed-effects regression analysis to create 75 regression models of moment-rotation response (25 intervertebral joints × 3 directions). We found that a cubic polynomial model provides a good representation of the moment-rotation behavior of most intervertebral joints, and that compressive loading increases rotational stiffness throughout the spine in all directions. The results allow for the direct evaluation of intervertebral ranges of motion across the whole of the spine for given loading conditions. The random-effects outcomes, representing standard deviations of the model coefficients across the dataset, can aid understanding of normal variations in moment-rotation responses. Overall these results fill a large gap, providing the first realistic and comprehensive representations of moment-rotation behavior at all levels of the spine, with broad implications for surgical planning, medical device design, computational modeling, and understanding of spine biomechanics.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the present study forty adult rabbits (1.6-2.2 kg) were collected and type 1 diabetic rabbit model was induced by injection of alloxan. A total of 10 control and 30 diabetic (with different time exposure to diabetic condition) rabbit descending thoracic aortas were harvested. Peeling tests were performed to quantitatively determine force/width values and dissection energy in the control and diabetic aortas. Histological and mass fraction analyses were performed to characterize the dissected morphology and to quantify dry weight percentages of elastin and collagen. The resisting force/width values were significantly higher for the diabetic thoracic aortas (in 8 weeks) than those of the control thoracic aortas (axial: 26.1 ± 4.0 vs. 20.5 ± 3.1 mN/mm, p = 0.04; circ: 19.7 ± 2.8 vs. 15.3 ± 1.9 mN/mm, p = 0.03). There was a higher resistance to the dissection in both axial and circumferential directions for the diabetic aortas. The dissection energy generated by axial and circumferential peeling of the diabetic aortas (in 6 and 8 weeks) was statistically significantly higher than that of the control aortas (axial: 5.6 ± 0.7 vs. 4.3 ± 0.5 mJ/cm2, p = 0.02; circ: 3.9 ± 0.3 vs. 3.2 ± 0.3 mJ/cm2, p = 0.02). Histology showed that dissection mainly occurred in the aortic media and the dissected surfaces were close to external elastic lamina for some specimens. The mass fractions of collagen within the diabetic aortas increased significantly as compared to the control aortas, whereas no significant change was found for that of elastin.

If confirmed, unstable sitting could be viewed as a proxy measure for these determinants. Wobbling chair motion was measured in 58 subjects with an inertial sensor, and six outcomes were computed (mean frequency and velocity, frequency dispersion, two variables from the sway density analysis and Lyapunov exponent - short interval) to represent TPC performance. Subjects also performed five other trunk neuromuscular tests to quantify the thickness of back and abdominal muscles and connective tissues, lumbar proprioception, lumbar stiffness, feedforward and feedback control mechanisms, and trunk/muscle coordination. Four to five predictors explained between 36 and 47% of TPC outcomes variance, as determined with multivariate analyses. These predictors were mainly related to (1) angular kinematic parameters of the pelvis or lumbar spine following rapid arm movement, (2) lumbar intrinsic stiffness, (3) thickness of perimuscular connective tissues surrounding specific abdominal muscles, (4) activation onsets of specific trunk muscles (IO/TrA and iliocostalis lumborum) before rapid arm movement, and (5) percent thickness change of internal oblique (IO) and transversus abdominis (TrA) muscles. Lumbar proprioception and reflex responses were not predictive, possibly due to the lack of appropriate measurements. These findings support the use of TPC in unstable sitting as a proxy measure for determinants associated with lumbar stability. This might be useful in research and clinical settings, considering time and equipment constraints associated with measuring these determinants individually.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is essential for the normal physiological function of cells and tissues, and for protection against disease progression, including atherosclerosis and cancer. In previous studies, we defined tensional homeostasis as the ability of cells to maintain a consistent level of cytoskeletal tension with low temporal fluctuations. In those studies, we measured temporal fluctuations of cell-substrate traction forces in clusters of endothelial cells and of fibroblasts. We observed those temporal fluctuations to decrease with increasing cluster size in endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts. We quantified temporal fluctuation, and thus homeostasis, through the coefficient of variation (CV) of the traction field; the lower the value of CV, the closer the cell is to the state of tensional homeostasis. This metric depends on correlation between individual traction forces. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of correlation between traction forces on traction field CV in clusters of endothelial cells and fibroblasts using experimental data that we had obtained previously. Results of our analysis showed that positive correlation between traction forces was detrimental to homeostasis, and that it was cell type-dependent.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

As a key role in these processes has been attributed to the abnormal hemodynamics establishing in the distal vein, the optimization of AVGs design aimed at minimizing flow disturbances would reduce AVG hemodynamic-related risks. In this study we used computational fluid dynamics to investigate the impact of alternative AVG designs on the reduction of IH and thrombosis risk at the distal venous anastomosis. The performance of the newly designed AVGs was compared to that of commercially available devices. In detail, a total of eight AVG models in closed-loop configuration were constructed: two models resemble the commercially available straight conventional and helical-shaped AVGs; six models are characterized by the insertion of a flow divider (FD), straight or helical shaped, differently positioned inside the graft. Unfavorable hemodynamic conditions were analyzed by assessing the exposure to disturbed shear at the distal vein. Bulk flow was investigated in terms of helical blood flow features, potential thrombosis risk, and pressure drop over the graft. Findings from this study clearly show that using a helically-shaped FD located at the venous side of the graft could induce beneficial helical flow patterns that, minimizing flow disturbances, reduce the IH-related risk of failure at the distal vein, with a clinically irrelevant increase in thrombosis risk and pressure drop over the graft.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The interaction between fibroblasts and tumor cells has previously been investigated through this model (Urdal et al., 2019) to comply with reported in vitro experimental results (Shieh et al., 2011). Using the information gained from in vitro single-cell behavior, what will the effect of fibroblast-enhanced tumor cell migration be in a tumor setting? In particular, how will tumor cells migrate in a heterogeneous tumor environment compared to controlled in vitro microfluidic-based experiments? From what we know about the behavior of a tumor, is that collective invasion into adjacent tissue is frequently observed. Here, we want to elucidate how fibroblasts may guide tumor cells towards draining lymphatics to which tumor cells may subsequently intravasate and thus spread to other parts of the body. Fibroblasts can act as leader cells, where they create tracks within the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix remodeling and contraction. In addition, a heterotypic mechanical adhesion between fibroblasts and tumor cells also assist the fibroblasts to act as leader cells. Our simulation results show how the interaction between the two cell types yields collective migration of tumor cells outwards from the tumor where fibroblasts dictate the direction of migration. The model also describes how this well-orchestrated invasive behavior is the result of a proper combination of different interaction forces between cell-ECM, fibroblast-ECM, fluid-ECM and cell-fibroblast.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We used particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure spatially-varying velocity of blood-analogue fluid within a patient-specific aneurysm model, and compared the observed flow behaviour to predictions from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. In PIV experiments we characterised the flow on multiple cross-sections for three different arterial flowrates (150, 250, 400 mL/min) after deployment of a commercially-available FD stent. Our flow-diverting (FD) stent model for CFD simulation was constructed using a permeability adapted from the literature. Aneurysmal haemodynamics without the FD stent treatment provided good similarities between CFD and PIV results, and the results with a Silk stent treatment also provided acceptable concordances, thereby validating the use of CFD as a convenient and flexible tool for investigating intra-aneurysmal flow dynamics after FD stent treatment. Furthermore, for the first time, the porous-medium FD model stent was validated to be both efficient and effective to predict the flow-diversion effects of a FD stent treatment with a patient-specific intracranial aneurysm. Through the qualitative and quantitative comparison of CFD predictions against the experimental outcomes, this study gives confidence for future studies on aneurysmal haemodynamics and FD stent treatment effects to use CFD simulation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Porcine eyes were subjected to an internal pressure simulating intraocular pressure. Ocular geometry was evaluated using a corneal topographer and digital cameras before and after dissection of the accommodative tissues. A computational model of the porcine eye was constructed and loaded by an internal pressure representing intraocular pressure. Eye shape was evaluated in models with and without the ciliary body. The porcine model was generalized to the human model, simplified model, or embryonic model with different ocular tissue shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. Experimental data showed that, even in the six-month-old pig eye, the average corneal radius of curvature increased after the removal of accommodative tissues compared to sham controls (p = 0.002). Computational results agreed with the experimental data and further suggested that the change in corneal radius is greater when the tissue stiffness is low and the intraocular pressure is high, regardless of the geometry and size of the eye components. Using a combined in vitro and in silico approach, this study explores the biomechanical influence of the accommodative tissues and related loads on the cornea and offers additional factors that might influence the shape of the cornea.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The contralateral limb is often used as a point of reference to determine the effects of knee joint injury. However, it is currently difficult to interpret within subject variability between limbs as this is not well established in the healthy population. There is a continuing need to characterize healthy knee joint mechanics and neuromuscular control to determine the degree of symmetry within healthy individuals. The current study quantified limb symmetry in healthy individuals using the finite helical axis with a unique reference position (rFHA) and electromyography (EMG) approaches, for a closed-chain single leg squat (SLS) and an open-chain seated leg swing. Muscle power and FHA translation, orientation and dispersion were similar between limbs. However, the FHA was located significantly more anterior in the dominant limb relative to the contralateral during both tasks. These between-limb differences in FHA location could be attributed to differences in joint geometry and strength between limbs. This finding provides evidence that healthy knees have asymmetries which have implications for selection of control limbs in studies comparing conditions within and between individuals. Differences identified in dynamic joint function between tasks suggest that the SLS is useful for revealing joint asymmetries due to altered muscular control strategies, while the swing task is expected to highlight asymmetries in joint motion due to altered knee structures following injury.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The secondary osteons of non-osteoporotic (by DXA) women with fragility fractures have reduced lamellar width and greater areas of birefringent brightness in transverse sections, a pathological condition. We used hierarchical finite element (FE) models of the proximal femur of two women aged 67 and 88 (younger and older) during one-legged stance. At specific locations of the anterior-inferior neck (ROI), we analyzed micro-models containing osteons comprised of alternating birefringent extinct and bright lamellae. The plane of lamellar isotropy (XY) was transverse to the osteon longitudinal axis (Z) which was parallel to the femoral neck axis. To evaluate changes in fracture risk with changes in microstructure, we investigated principal and von Mises stresses, and planar stress measures that accounted for transverse isotropy. For both younger and older femurs, 48% to 100% of stress measures were larger in models with healthy architecture than in models with pathological architecture, while controlling for type of lamella and osteon. These findings suggest that bone adaptation reduces stress at most pathological lamellar sites. However, in the bright lamellae of the younger femur, the pathological tensile, compressive and distortional stresses in the transverse plane and distortional stress in the longitudinal planes were larger than the non-negligible corresponding stresses in 6 of the 28 osteon models with healthy architecture, in 5 of the 7 locations.

Participants were supported in a forward-leaning position on top of an inverted pendulum that isolated arm reaction by preventing any fall arresting contribution that may come from the ankle, knees, or hip. At an unpredictable time, the pendulum was released requiring participants to rapidly orient their arms to protect the head and body. Vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), arm kinematics, and electromyographic (EMG) measures of the biceps and triceps were compared at four initial lean angles. The time following perturbation onset and prior to impact consisted of two phases: rapid extension of the elbows and co-activation of the biceps and triceps in preparation for impact. The rapid orientation phase was modulated with fall height while the co-activation of the biceps and triceps in preparation for landing was minimally affected. Larger lean angles resulted in increased vGRF, increased elbow extension at impact, decreased elbow angular extension velocity at impact, and increased neck velocity at impact while hand velocity at impact was not significantly affected. The neuromuscular control strategy appears to optimize elbow extension angle/angular velocity prior to co-activation of the biceps and triceps that occurs about 100 ms prior to impact. Future work should investigate how the neuromuscular control strategy handles delayed deployment of protective arm reactions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The braced arm-to-thigh technique (BATT) is a one-handed lifting method in which the dominant hand picks up objects, while the free hand braces the trunk on the ipsilateral thigh. The aim of this study was to compare the BATT to two-handed or unsupported one-handed lifting techniques with loads of 2 and 10 kg, by evaluating trunk motion and spine loading at L4/L5. Twenty healthy participants (30-70 years old) matched in age and sex to 18 participants with low back pain were recruited to the study. A three-axis load cell secured to the distal anterior thigh measured the bracing forces applied by the hand. The OpenSim Lifting Full-Body model was used to estimate trunk kinematics and spinal loading at L4/L5. Linear mixed-effects models were developed to compare trunk angles and L4/L5 moments and forces between lifting techniques. Trunk flexion angles were significantly reduced for the BATT lift compared to one-handed and two-handed stoop lifts (9-20%). However, the BATT also increased asymmetric trunk kinematics and moments at L4/L5. The BATT produced significantly lower moments (28-38%), and compressive (25-32%) and antero-posterior shear (25-45%) forces at L4/L5, compared to unsupported lifting techniques.

The current study therefore aimed at the comparative evaluation of the Epionics SPINE system, a portable device for measuring sagittal lumbar back motion during functional activities. Twenty healthy participants were therefore evaluated with the Epionics SPINE and a Vicon motion capture system in two identical separate research visits. They performed the following activities: standing, sitting, chair rising, box lifting, walking, running and a counter movement jump (CMJ). Lumbar lordosis angles were extracted as continuous values as well as average and range of motion (ROM) parameters. Agreement between the systems was evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses, whereas within- and between-session reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and minimal detectable changes (MDC). The analysis showed excellent agreement between the systems for chair rising, box lifting and CMJ with a systematic underestimation of lumbar lordosis angles during walking and running. Reliability was moderate to high for all continuous and discrete parameters (ICC ≥ 0.62), except for ROM during running (ICC = 0.29). MDC values were generally below 15°, except for CMJ (peak values up to 20° within and 25° between the sessions).

Additionally, we aim to define a method that minimizes the confounding effects of foot flexibility on estimates of talo-crural joint angles and TS extensibility. Children, aged 6-13 years, with SCP (GMFCS I-III, n = 13) and TD children (n = 14) participated in this study. Externally applied -1 Nm, 0 Nm, 1 Nm and 4 Nm dorsal flexion foot plate moments were imposed. Resulting TS origin-insertion lengths, foot sole (φFoSo) rotations, and changes in talo-crural joint angle (φTaCr) were measured. Foot flexibility was quantified as Δ(φTaCr -φFoSo) between the 0 Nm and 4 Nm dorsal flexion conditions. In both groups, φFoSo rotations of approximately 20° were observed between 0 Nm and 4 Nm dorsal flexion, of which about 6° (≈30%) was related to foot flexibility. Foot flexibility correlated to φFoSo (r = 0.69) but not to φTaCr (r = 0.11). For φFoSo no significant differences were found between groups at 4 Nm. However, for SCP children the mean estimate of φTaCr was 4.3° more towards plantar flexion compared to the TD group (p < 0.05). Normalized TS lengths show a higher coefficient of correlation with φTaCr (r2 = 0.82) than with φFoSo (r2 = 0.60), indicating that TS lengths are better estimated by talo-cural joint angles. In both SCP and TD children aged 6-13 year, estimates of TS length and extensibility based on foot sole assessments are confounded by foot flexibility. Assessments of TS extensibility at physical examination will be more accurate when based on measurements of talo-crural joint angles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Differences in kinematic temporal characteristics between single-leg and double-leg landings are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine discrete and temporal kinematics associated with functional valgus collapse during single-leg and double-leg landings (LANDSL and LANDDL). Three-dimensional kinematics were obtained during the landing phases of LANDSL and LANDDL in ninety participants (45 females: 20.1 ± 1.7 yr, 165.2 ± 7.6 cm, 68.6 ± 13.1 kg; 45 males: 20.7 ± 2.0 yr, 177.7 ± 8.5 cm, 82.8 ± 16.3 kg). Peak joint angles and time series curves for frontal and transverse plane hip and knee kinematics were analyzed with an RMANOVA (discrete variables) and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) paired t-tests (time series). LANDSL elicited greater knee abduction than LANDDL from 0 to 35% (0-73 ms) but greater knee adduction from 54 to 100% (112-207 ms). Peak knee abduction was 2.0° greater during LANDDL than during LANDSL (p < .001). LANDSL elicited greater hip adduction than LANDDL from 2 to 33% (4-69 ms) and greater hip abduction from 49 to 100% (102-207 ms). Peak hip adduction was 4.6° greater during LANDSL than during LANDDL (p < .001). LANDSL elicited less knee internal rotation from 0 to 3% and greater hip internal rotation from 52 to 75% of the landing phase. Peak transverse plane joint angles did not differ between tasks. During the time frame in which ACL injuries are thought to occur, LANDSL elicited frontal plane knee and hip movement consistent with risky biomechanics.

Influences of age, sex, and plane of motion.","Old age is associated with variability in gait motor output, particularly in females, and is linked to fall risk. However, little is known about how older age and sex affect variability in the outputs of individual joints, and how these variabilities contribute to the collective gait output. Healthy adults aged 18-99 years (N = 102, 57 females) completed six trials of straight walking at self-selected speed. Stride time variability (coefficient of variation) and variabilities of lower limb tridimensional joint angles (standard deviations: SD) were calculated. Age * Sex (A * S) mixed models were conducted on all measures and year-by-year rates of change were subsequently estimated. Correlations and stepwise linear regression analyses were computed between joint angular variabilities and stride time variability. Each year of age was associated with 0.022% higher stride time variability (A: p = .002), 0.07° lower variability in peak ankle dorsiflexion (A: p = .004), 0.002-0.098° higher variability in mean ankle inversion/eversion, mean pelvic obliquity, and pelvic rotation range of motion (A: p < .05), and 0.024° higher variability in knee flexion/extension range of motion in males (A * S: p = .003). Higher variability in mean ankle and hip flexion/extension and in mean ankle inversion/eversion correlated with (ρ = 0.211-0.336; ps < 0.05) and independently predicted higher stride time variability (ps < 0.05), together explaining 21.9% of variance.

We examined whether hip and knee coordination is altered during single-limb step-downs following a hip extensor fatigue protocol. Forty participants in this randomized controlled trial performed 20 single-limb step-downs before and after completing either a fatigue protocol or a sham fatigue protocol. Means and SDs of sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee kinematics were measured. Nonlinear measures of coupled hip and knee coordination were examined with cross recurrence quantification analyses. Pre- to post-fatigue change scores were analyzed inferentially (α = 0.05). The fatigue protocol induced 22.2% strength reduction in the fatigue group, versus 4% reduction in the sham group. Neither the magnitude nor variability in sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee kinematics changed following the fatigue protocol (P > .05, small effect sizes). Participants in the fatigue group, however, performed post-fatigue step-downs with greater cross determinism (P = .046, effect size = 0.71) and mean line (P = .038, effect size = 0.74) in sagittal plane hip and frontal plane knee coupling, whereas participants in the sham-control group performed step-downs with reductions in those measures. In the fatigued state, participants performed repeated step-downs with subtle increases in cross determinism and cross mean line, which implies they performed the task with greater predictability of hip and knee coupling and less adaptability.

This, in turn, necessitates approximating the segment angular velocity. Methods can be distinguished by the way in which a segment is defined and the assumptions used for estimating the segment angular velocity. However, isolating foot-ankle performance from overall prosthetic system performance is limited by uncertainties in the definition of angular velocity of a deformable segment. A deformable link segment (DLS) analysis is proposed that provides a means for estimating deformation velocity of a deformable segment without first approximating the angular velocity: the deformation velocity and angular velocity are solved simultaneously at each instant during the stance phase of gait. DLS analysis was compared to two approaches in the literature: the distal foot (DF) model and the unified deformable (UD) segment model during over-ground walking for three trans-tibial prosthesis users. DLS and UD segment estimates of deformation velocity were comparable when applied to the UD segment. Furthermore, DLS analysis enables modelling of deformable prosthetic foot-ankle components separately from other prosthetic componentry. The method is proposed as a rigorous approach to estimating angular velocity and deformation velocity of passive prosthetic foot-ankle components for subsequent calculation of deformation power and energy performance of these devices.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present study investigated the concurrent validity of the GDI as an outcome measure of gait defects at a chronic stage of recovery post-stroke, through comparisons with conventional measures of gait. Those enrolled included 65 individuals after stroke and 65 healthy individuals without gait disorders, matched for age and gender. The kinematic gait parameters were measured using a movement analysis system. Walking speed, walking distance, number of steps, self-reliant mobility, cadence, step length, and single support time were evaluated. Strong correlation was found between cadence and mGDI as well as GDI for the affected leg (0.7 ≤ |R| < 0.9; p < 0.001). Moderate correlations were found between walking speed, number of steps, step length affected leg and mGDI as well as GDI for the affected leg (0.5 ≤ |R| < 0.7; p < 0.001). Low correlations were found between walking distance, self-reliant mobility, single support time affected leg and mGDI as well as GDI for the affected leg (0.3 ≤ |R| < 0.5; p < 0.001; p < 0.005). The findings confirm the concurrent validity of the GDI, but only for the affected leg and mGDI in post-stroke patients.

A public dataset of raw running biomechanics was used for the purposes of the analysis, containing recordings of twenty-eight competitive or elite athletes running on an instrumented treadmill at three different speeds. A grid-search on half of the trials was employed to seek the values of the parameters that optimise the approximation of biomechanical loads. Two-way ANOVAs were then conducted to examine the significance of the parameterised factors in the modelled waveforms. The reserved recordings were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the model. The cut-off filtering frequencies of the pelvis and thigh markers were correlated to running speed and heel-strike patterns, respectively. Optimal segment masses were in agreement with standardised literature reported values. Root mean square errors for slow running (2.5 m/s) were on average equal to 0.1 (body weight normalized). Errors increased with running speeds to 0.13 and 0.18 for 3.5 m/s and 4.5 m/s, respectively. This study accurately estimated vertical ground reaction forces for slow-paced running by only considering the kinematics of the pelvis and thighs.

Despite current perturbation and fall prevention paradigms, occupational fall prevalence remains stable. Typically, these paradigms do not account for arm swing which has been demonstrated to affect the center of mass' movement during walking. This study examined the effect of different arm swing on postural control during symmetric and asymmetric walking. Fifteen healthy young adults (age = 23.4 ± 2.8) walked symmetrically and asymmetrically with three arm motions (normal, held, and active) on a split-belt treadmill CAREN Extended-System (Motek Medical, Amsterdam, NL). Mean, standard deviation and maximal values of trunk linear and angular velocity, and whole-body angular momentum were calculated in all three axes; additionally, step length, time and width mean and Coefficient of Variation, Margin of Stability and Harmonic Ratios were calculated. Compared to normal and held conditions, active arm increased trunk linear and angular velocity standard deviation, max velocity values, mean step length and time, as well as the Coefficient of Variation for step length, time, and width. Furthermore, whole-body angular momentum increased as a function of arm swing amplitude. Active arm swing further reduced Harmonic Ratios in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. Asymmetric walking increased average step time, and width as well as increased the Coefficient of Variation for step length and time but reduced left average step length and step width Coefficient of Variation. Further, asymmetric walking increased mediolateral Margin of Stability and reduced anteroposterior and mediolateral Harmonic Ratios. Finally, results demonstrated that actively increasing arm swing increases trunk linear and angular velocity variability in healthy young adults during symmetric and asymmetric treadmill walking. Findings may be due to active arm swing and asymmetric walking causing a disproportional contribution to trunk and center of mass movement causing participants to modify their base of support to maintain stability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Video analysis was performed for 16 head-to-ground impacts that caused concussions. Average resultant closing velocity was 8.3 m/s at an angle nearly 45° to the surface. Preimpact rotational velocity of the helmet ranged from negligible to as high as 54.1 rad/s. Helmet impacts were concentrated on the posterior and lateral aspects. To study the interaction in greater detail, a helmeted anthropomorphic test device (ATD) was launched over a football field and fell to the ground in various impact conditions. Substantial decoupling between the helmet and the head was observed, such that the head rebounded within the helmet and underwent changes in linear and rotational motion greater than those of the helmet. Vertical helmet rebound was also observed; the helmet underwent a change in vertical velocity on average 24% greater than the vertical component of its closing velocity. Frictional interaction between the helmet and the ground surface caused the helmet to undergo an average horizontal change in velocity of 57% of the horizontal component of its closing velocity. Finally, the duration of a helmet-to-ground impact was generally in the range of 15 - 30 ms, suggesting that the impact surface provides little ride-down. Lengthening this duration could be beneficial both by reducing the peak linear and rotational acceleration and by shifting the impact toward a time regime where brain strain is related to rotational acceleration rather than rotational velocity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using crutches encourages more physical activity than many other assistive devices, which has long-term health benefits. Recent advances have led to improvements in performance, but using crutches remains slower than normal walking, are energetically inefficient, cause additional strain on upper extremities, and often result in abrasions on the skin. Further improvements to address these deficiencies are needed but require an understanding of the crutch users' disabilities, different crutch gait patterns, associated biomechanics, and how the crutch design interacts with the user. It is important that research studies and designs take into account parameters from multiple ways of measuring performance in order for impaired users to achieve effective crutch walking. Many existing studies of crutches only analyze a subset of quantitative variables, so the overall impact of a design or modification is not fully assessed or comparable to other designs. Another important aspect is the user; each crutch type has specific characteristics that need to match the user's ability, physical fitness, and gait pattern. Pain and injuries on upper extremities should also be considered as an important factor in long-term users. A search was done to find research papers and related patents focusing on crutch design and usage. Papers that studied one or more of the following topics were included: effects of crutches on the gait parameter, types of crutch walking patterns, improving walking efficiency through crutch design, and identifying the important components when studying a gait. This review paper summarizes the effects of existing crutch types and gives guidelines for how future studies should comprehensively evaluate design changes.

Exposure to foot-transmitted vibration (FTV) is associated with an increased risk of developing vibration-induced white foot (VIWFt). VIWFt is a vascular and neurological condition of the lower limb, leading to blanching in the toes and numbness and tingling in the feet, which can be disabling for the worker. This paper presents a two-dimensional dynamic model describing the response of the foot-ankle system to vibration using four segments and eight Kelvin-Voigt models. The parameters of the model have been obtained by minimizing the quadratic reconstruction error between the experimental and numerical curves of the transmissibility and the apparent mass of participants standing in a neutral position. The average transmissibility at five locations on the foot has been optimized by minimizing the difference between experimental data and the model prediction between 10 and 100 Hz. The same procedure has been repeated to fit the apparent mass measured at the driving point in a frequency range between 2 and 20 Hz. Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess how the variability of the mass, stiffness and damping matrices affect the overall data dispersion. Results showed that the 7°-of-freedom model correctly described the transmissibility: the average transmissibility modulus error was 0.1. The error increased when fitting the transmissibility and apparent mass curves: the average modulus error was 0.3. However, the obtained values were reasonable with respect to the average inter-participant variability experimentally estimated at 0.52 for the modulus. Study results can contribute to the development of materials and equipment to attenuate FTV and, consequently, lower the risk of developing VIWFt.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

No standard measure exists for diagnosing alar ligament injury and imaging findings vary widely. Multiple physical examination maneuvers are used to diagnose alar ligament injury including the C2 Spinous Kick, Flexion-Rotation, and Bending-Rotation tests. The objective of the current study was to determine the mechanical contribution of the alar ligaments to upper cervical stability and quantify the biomechanical changes seen during simulated clinical examinations after alar ligament injury. Eight cadaveric C0-C3 specimens were evaluated using a robotic testing system. Range of motion and moment at the end of intact specimen replay were the primary outcomes. Clinical examinations were simulated by rotation through two axes as performed during physical examination. Intact, unilateral and bilateral alar ligament injury states were tested. Unilateral alar ligament injury led to significant increases in lateral bending (12.0 ± 7.2%, p < 0.05), axial rotation (4.1 ± 2.4%, p < 0.05), and flexion-extension (5.3 ± 4.3%, p < 0.05) compared with intact specimens. The alar ligaments also contributed to resistance to intact motion in extension (13.4 ± 6.6%, p < 0.05), flexion (4.4 ± 2.2%, p < 0.05), axial rotation (19.3 ± 2.7%, p < 0.05), and lateral bending (16.0 ± 2.8%, p < 0.05). The C2 Spinous Kick Test showed the largest percentage change (-23.0 ± 14.8%), and the Bending-Rotation Test towards the side of injury significantly increased axial rotation by the largest absolute magnitude (5.5° ± 5.1°).

However, for patient-specific computational analysis, complex procedures are usually required to set-up the models, and long computing time is needed to perform the simulation, preventing fast feedback to clinicians in time-sensitive clinical applications. In this study, by using machine learning techniques, we developed deep neural networks (DNNs) to directly estimate the steady-state distributions of pressure and flow velocity inside the thoracic aorta. After training on hemodynamic data from CFD simulations, the DNNs take as input a shape of the aorta and directly output the hemodynamic distributions in one second. The trained DNNs are capable of predicting the velocity magnitude field with an average error of 1.9608% and the pressure field with an average error of 1.4269%.

The objective was to validate the low-cost Neuron IMC system with OMC. Whole-body kinematics were recorded on five healthy subjects during manual handling of boxes for about 32 min while wearing 17 magnetic and inertial measurement units with Optotrak clusters serving as a reference. The kinematical model was calibrated anatomically for OMC and with poses for IMC. Local coordinate systems were aligned with angular velocities to dissociate differences due to technology or kinematical model. Descriptive statistics including the root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) and limits of agreement (LoA) were applied to the joint angle curves. The average technological error yielded 5.8° and 4.9° for RMSE, 0.87 and 0.96 for CMC and 0.4 ± 8.6° and -0.3 ± 6.0° for LoA about the frontal and transverse axes respectively, whereas the longitudinal axis yielded 10.5° for RMSE, 0.78 for CMC and 3.3 ± 13.1° for LoA. Differences due to technology and to the model contributed similarly to the total difference between IMC and OMC. For many joints and axes, RMSE stayed under 5°, CMC over 0.9 and LoA under 10°, especially for the transverse axis and lower limb.

In this study, PVA hydrogel was produced by freeze-thaw crosslinking method, and its mechanical properties such as viscoelastic and hyperplastic behavior, which cannot be obtained analytically, was investigated with a coupled finite element (FE)-optimization algorithm and stress relaxation experimental data. To obtain isotropic hyper-viscoelastic constitutive parameters of PVA scaffolds, the Mooney-Rivlin and Neo-Hooke strain energy functions, in which shear and bulk moduli varies with time, were applied. Results showed that predicted mechanical responses of scaffolds by the Mooney-Rivlin model better fitted stress-relaxation experiments than those obtained by Neo-Hooke one.

However, the accuracy of these techniques is limited by soft-tissue artefacts. Furthermore, structures like the thorax are frequently assumed to be rigid but display considerable mobility within itself. This study aimed to quantify the accuracy at different thoracic landmarks for measuring mobility in healthy individuals during different activities to provide a recommendation for the best suited measurement location. The locations of 29 landmarks were continuously captured on 19 individuals (age: 25-59 years) during sitting, standing, walking, jumping, intra-thoracic motions, and different breathing depths using reflective markers. Marker triplets were used at every landmark to calculate their orientations by first backtracking the rigid-body motion (RBM) of the thorax in general, and subsequently calculating the RBM of each rigid marker triplet. Of the latter, the maximum axis angle for each exercise was statistically evaluated. Landmarks at the middle of the clavicles displayed the largest overall errors (approximately 90° during worst case scenario). However, the variability of errors among the investigated exercises was large. Landmarks at the cranial sternal region (particularly at the ""Louis angle"") and at the T3 spinous process showed the smallest errors for all subjects and tasks (e.g., <5° and <11°, respectively, during normal breathing). When only one sensor is to be used, it is recommended to use the cranial sternal region to assess the thoracic orientation.

The four indices used most often to assess symmetry are not well designed for different variable types, perform poorly when presented with cases of high asymmetry or when variables are of low magnitude, and are easily influenced by small variation in the signal. The purpose of the present study was to test the performance of these indices on previously unpublished data on ACL-R patients and to propose a new index to resolve some of these limitations. The performance of four currently used indices and a new index-the Normalized Symmetry Index (NSI), which is scaled to the range of variables being tested across multiple trials-were compared using force and angular data on participants who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and healthy controls. The NSI performed well compared to all other indices with all variables and had the additional benefit of returning values that range from 0% (full symmetry) to ±100% (full asymmetry). Therefore, the NSI can serve as a universal index for assessing asymmetry in humans, nonhuman animal models, and in a clinical context for assessing risk for injury and clinical outcomes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Three fast rectal bag distensions to the pain threshold were done in seven healthy females. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for sensory assessment. At each distension, we determined (1) time, bag cross-sectional area (CSA), radius (r), r/r0, pressure and tension to reach VAS = 1, 3 and 5 (pain threshold); (2) the same parameters at induced contraction start; (3) CSA where the pressure started to increase (CSAP>baseline) and (4) the number of contractions. The time, CSA, r/r0 and tension to reach VAS = 1 and VAS = 3 increased from distension 1 to 3 (4.9 < F < 11.5, 0.05 > P > 0.007), primarily due to difference between the first and second distension. For VAS = 5, r/r0 was smaller in distension 3 than distension 1 (P < 0.05), whereas time, CSA and tension did not differ between distensions (P > 0.5). Compared with distension 1, CSA, r/r0 and tension at contraction start, and CSAP>baseline were bigger in distensions 2 and 3 (5.5 < F < 10.9, 0.05 > P > 0.009). The pressure to reach the VAS levels, the contraction numbers and pressure at contraction start did not differ among distensions (P > 0.6). During mechanical preconditioning, CSA, tension and deformation increased at sub-pain levels, reflecting sensory adaptation.

The objective of study was to analyse the influence of different breast support and footwear on vertebral posture during walking and running. Seventeen women (x¯ = 23.51; SD = 3.70 years) performed a treadmill walking (5 km/h) and running (7 and 10 km/h) with different footwear (barefoot, minimalist and traditional) and breast support (bare breast, everyday bra and sports bra) conditions. Spine movements were analyzed using three cameras in grayscale video mode, positioned behind the participant to register reflective markers fixed in the vertebrae. From the 3D coordinates of the trunk markers we computed, for the whole gait cycle (C) and for the average gait posture (neutral curve-NC) the maximal (M) thoracic (T) kyphosis and lateral flexion, and the maximal lumbar (L) lordosis and lateral flexion. Frontal plane: bare breast presented higher lumbar NC than the everyday bra and sports bra, higher MLC than the sports bra and lower MTC than the everyday bra and sports bra. Barefoot presented higher MTC than minimalist. Sagittal plane: bare breast presented lower MTC than the sports bra. Barefoot presented higher lumbar NC than the minimalist and traditional footwear and higher MLC than the minimalist and traditional ones. The sports bra increased curvatures in the thoracic spine that were rectified during bare breast conditions. In addition, both footwears were able to maintain the natural curvatures of the spine in the lumbar.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study included a total of 40 healthy sedentary young females between the ages of 19 and 35 years. Single-leg stance balance assessments were carried out using Biodex Balance Systems (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). Performance in the single-leg stance balance tests was assessed using the overall stability index (OSI), mediolateral stability index (MLSI) and the anteroposterior stability index (APSI). Lower scores indicated better postural stability. Stiffness, thickness and cross-sectional area measurements of the abductor hallucis (AbH), flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and flexor hallucis brevis (FHB) muscles were performed using an ultrasonography device. Larger AbH and FHB muscles were correlated with higher OSI, APSI, and MLSI (r = 0.31-0.46, p < 0.05), whereas larger FDB muscle was correlated with higher OSI and MLSI (r = 0.28-0.38, p < 0.05). Higher stiffness of the AbH and FHB muscles were correlated with lower OSI, APSI, and MLSI (r = -0.32 to 0.58, p < 0.05), but stiffness of the FDB muscle was not significantly correlated with OSI, APSI, and MLSI (r = 0.03-0.22, p ˃ 0.05). These results suggest that larger AbH, FDB and FHB muscles are related to reduced performance in single-leg stance balance tests, whereas higher AbH and FHB stiffness are related to better performance in single-leg stance balance tests in healthy sedentary young females.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twenty male and twenty female participants completed full range humeral elevations in three planes of elevation (0/40/90°) and three hand loads (unloaded/20%/40% of maximal elevation strength). EMG activation was combined with motion capture to determine activation at instantaneous activation angles, and linear regressions of anterior and posterior indwelling electrodes relative to the surface electrode determined relationships between these signals. Regressions between surface and indwelling signals were affected by plane of elevation, elevation angle, load intensity and participant sex, but no interactions existed. Surface signals underestimated activation at low elevation angles for both regions, and up to 45% in the anterior supraspinatus (p < 0.01), then overestimated activation at higher elevation angles. Surface EMG underestimated indwelling signals by up to 15% in unloaded conditions, while overestimating the posterior region by up to 17% in the 40% load condition (p < 0.01).

In-body tissue architecture (iBTA), a cell-free, in vivo tissue-engineering technology that can form autologous implantable tissues of the desired shape by subcutaneous embedding specially designed molds, was used to prepare sheet-like collagenous tissues called ""Biosheets"". Cylindrical molds with several line slits arranged in an alternating (n = 30) or parallel (n = 36) pattern were subcutaneously embedded in goats (n = 12) for 2 or 3 months. The tubular tissues formed in the molds were dried and then cut in the longitudinal direction, thus obtaining Biosheets (5 × 7 cm). The success rate was 97.6% when using the alternating-pattern molds and 97.2% for the parallel molds. Thickness mapping of the Biosheets showed that their entire surface, except for the line-projection portions, was smooth without any defects. The average wall thickness could be controlled over a range of ca. 0.2-0.5 mm by changing the size of the gap (0.75-1.5 mm) in the molds. The alternating slit-patterned Biosheets were found to be almost isotropic in their mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength, fracture strain, and Young's modulus). Although the composition of the Biosheet wall was heterogeneous in terms of its density (which varied with the thickness), the breaking strength of all the alternating-patterned Biosheets increased almost linearly with the thickness within the range of the thickness of clinically used glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium as a control, and was larger than that of human aortic valve leaflets.

How the active transformation of the airway geometry affects airflow dynamics during respiration is not well understood despite the importance of this knowledge towards improving current understanding of particle transport and deposition. In this study, particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the fluid dynamics are presented in a physiologically realistic human upper airway replica for (i) the undeformed case and (ii) the case where realistic soft tissue motion during breathing is emulated. Results from this study show that extrathoracic wall motion alters the flow field significantly such that the fluid dynamics is distinctly different from the undeformed airway. Distinctive flow field patterns in the physiologically realistic airway include (i) fluid recirculation at the back of the tongue and cranial to the tip of the epiglottis during mid-inspiration, (ii) horizontal and posteriorly directed flow at the back of tongue at the peak of inspiration and (iii) a more homogeneous flow across the airway downstream from the epiglottis. These findings suggest that the active deformation of the human upper airway may potentially influence particle transport and deposition at the back of the tongue and therefore, highlights the importance of considering extrathoracic wall motion in future airway flow studies.

Changes in neuromuscular control, that already start at middle-age, may underlie the age-related changes in gait adaptation. Thus, we examined the effects of age on adaptations in gait and muscle activation patterns during split-belt walking in healthy young and middle-aged adults. Young (23.3 ± 3.13 years) and middle-aged adults (55.3 ± 2.91 years) walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill. Both age groups adapted similarly by reducing asymmetry in step length and double support time. Surface EMG was recorded from eight leg muscles bilaterally. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the EMG data of all subjects, for the fast and slow leg separately, to identify muscle activation patterns. The principal components consisted of i.e. temporal projections that were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). The functional muscle groups, identified by PCA, increased activation during early adaptation and post-adaptation, and decreased activation over time similarly in both age groups. Extra activation peaks of the plantar- and dorsiflexors suggest a role in gait modulation during split-belt walking. Both young and middle-aged adults re-established gait symmetry and showed adaptation effects in the muscle activation patterns. Since the adaptation of muscle activation patterns parallels adaptation of gait symmetry, changes in muscle activation likely underlie the changes in step parameters during split-belt adaptation. In conclusion, split-belt adaptation, in terms of gait and muscle activation patterns, is still preserved at middle-age, suggesting that age-related differences occur later in the lifespan.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, frictional requirements of climbing, which presumably influence slip risk, are unknown. The purpose of this study was to quantify frictional requirements during climbing at different ladder angles. The required coefficient of friction (RCOF) was calculated during ladder climbing and assessed for three ladder angles (75.5°, 82.8°, and 90°). Data was collected from 10 participants at each angle. Kinetic data and kinematic data of the climber's shoe was collected and used to map friction and normal forces to the shoe. These forces were then used to calculate the RCOF. The RCOF and friction force at 90° was higher than at lower angles (75.5° and 82.8°). RCOF was correlated with shoe angle and body angle supporting both the relevance of shoe orientation and body position to slip risk. This study suggests that frictional requirements of ladder climbing are dependent on ladder angle, shoe orientation, and body angle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The present STEM pipeline preferentially engages youth who are, not only aware of and interested in STEM, but also, can see themselves on a path to a STEM career. The present pipeline fails to capture youth for whom STEM remains remote and outside their current experience. Interest in sports casts a wider net and includes populations currently underrepresented in the STEM pipeline and in STEM careers. To engage these young people in STEM, it is necessary to incorporate STEM into activities they enjoy and already participate in, such as sports. Sports engage millions of youth who are intrinsically motivated to grow and improve as athletes. Biomechanical experiments and activities can build a bridge between young people's interest in sport activities to awareness and interest in STEM. This connection between science and sports is reinforced by the growing use of sports-science as a tool for elite athletic performance at the highest levels. The potential of sports-science to provide diverse youth with access to the STEM Pipeline is extraordinarily promising. Biomechanics researchers are uniquely positioned to deliver on the promise of sport-science based STEM outreach due to the applicability of biomechanical analysis to sports-science analysis. Historically, and not without resistance and great effort, participation in sports has broken barriers of cultural and racial discrimination within broader society.

Gait indexes have been developed to synthesize the data provided by the three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis such as the Gait Deviation Index (GDI) and the Gait Profile Score (GPS) where the gait variable score (GVS) can be calculated. The objective this study was to evaluate the potential use of the GDI and GPS and MAP using data from 3D gait analysis of DMD patients. The dimension 1 score of the Motor Function Measurement defined the groups that composed the cluster analysis. Twenty patients with DMD composed 2 groups according to the cluster analysis (Cluster 1, n = 10; Cluster 2, n = 10). Three-dimensional gait analysis was conducted where GDI, GPS and GVS (pelvic tilt/obliquity; hip flexion-extension/adduction-abduction/rotation; knee flexion-extension; ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion, foot progression angle) were calculated. Cluster 1 group presented lower hip flexion-extension and lower pelvic obliquity when compared with Cluster 2 group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between groups for GDI, GPS total and maximum isometric muscle strength of the lower limbs (p > 0.05).

Adequate compensation for such perturbations is crucial in maintaining effective postural control. Studies utilising instrumented treadmills have previously validated perturbed walking protocols, however responses to perturbed running protocols remain less investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a new instrumented treadmill-perturbed running protocol. Fifteen participants (age = 28 ± 3 years; height = 172 ± 9 cm; weight = 69 ± 10 kg; 60% female) completed an 8-minute running protocol at baseline velocity of 2.5 m/s (9 km/h), whilst 15 one-sided belt perturbations were applied (pre-set perturbation characteristics: 150 ms delay (post-heel contact); 2.0 m/s amplitude; 100 ms duration). Perturbation characteristics and EMG responses were recorded. Bland-Altman analysis (BLA) was employed (bias ± limits of agreement (LOA; bias ± 1.96*SD)) and intra-individual variability of repeated perturbations was assessed via Coefficients of Variation (CV) (mean ± SD). On average, 9.4 ± 2.2 of 15 intended perturbations were successful. Perturbation delay was 143 ± 10 ms, amplitude was 1.7 ± 0.2 m/s and duration was 69 ± 10 ms. BLA showed -7 ± 13 ms for delay, -0.3 ± 0.1 m/s for amplitude and -30 ± 10 ms for duration. CV showed variability of 19 ± 4.5% for delay, 58 ± 12% for amplitude and 30 ± 7% for duration. EMG RMS amplitudes of the legs and trunk ranged from 113 ± 25% to 332 ± 305% when compared to unperturbed gait.

However, there is currently a lack of personalized and objective methods to guide surgical operations, which results in the excessive or inadequate resection of HIT. In this study, we proposed an optimizing method based on homotopy deformation to determine the resected amount and shape of the tissue by matching the flow resistance in the two nasal passageways. The simulation results obtained using computational fluid dynamics showed that after such an optimization procedure, the most obstructed nasal side could have a similar air flux as the less obstructed side. A 35% and a 56% less tissue resection in the optimizing operation compared to that in the total turbinectomy could well balance the air flow between the two nasal cavities in the simulations for patients 1 and 2 with unilateral nasal obstruction respectively. Compared with the optimization operation, the total turbinectomy made a more aggressive resection of HIT, which could worsen the air conditioning capacity of the nose. A sensitivity test indicated that in the optimization operation, the most constricted region in the nasal cavity should be adequately enlarged. However, more tissue resection than is required for the optimization operation did not improve the flow in the obstructed side strikingly. Simulations of the optimization operation in both nasal cavities for a patient with bilateral nasal obstruction were also performed. The flow rate could reach the normal level and be well balanced in the two sides after such an optimization procedure.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Gait modifications, including lateral trunk lean (TL), medial knee thrust (MKT), and reduced foot progression (FP) have decreased KAM. However, their effects on the hip joint are poorly understood. Reduced hip abduction moment has been found to be predictive of KOA progression and has been hypothesized to represent a decreased demand on the hip musculature. Lack of studies investigating changes in hip mechanics as a result of gait modification limits our understanding of their cumulative benefit, therefore, we investigated the effects of TL, MKT, and FP on internal hip abduction moment as well as rate change in net joint reaction force. Using real-time visual biofeedback, five trials were completed for each modification. Each modification target range was individualized to 3-5 SD greater (TL and FP) or lesser (MKT) than the participants mean baseline value. Kinematics and kinetics at the hip and knee were calculated at first peak KAM. Trunk lean and MKT decreased hip abduction moment compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Trunk lean increased rate change in net joint reaction force at both the hip (p < 0.001) and knee (p < 0.001) compared to baseline. Additional research is needed to fully understand the effect of gait modifications in a clinical population, particularly the relationship between hip abduction moments and KOA progression.

Scores obtained in the test evaluating fine motor skills decreased by an average of 29% when wearing gloves, while scores obtained on those evaluating gross motor skills and capability to perform activities of daily living were reduced by an average of 8% and 3%, respectively.

While genetic factors are considered the most relevant in the onset of degeneration, the mechanics play an important role in its progression. Degenerative changes in one of these two structures are believed to induce degeneration in the other. However, despite decades of research, there is no consensus on the mechanical interplay between the two structures. On the basis of a parametric finite element model of a human L4-L5 spinal motion segment, one thousand individual segments were probabilistically generated covering all grades of degeneration in both structures. The segments were subjected to combined compression and flexion/extension loads. Correlation matrices were created to identify the effect of individual degeneration parameters of each structure on the mechanical stresses in the corresponding counterpart. In the non-degenerated group, a strong positive and a moderate negative correlation was found between the strain of the capsular ligament and the disc height and the nucleus compressibility, respectively. With increasing degeneration, the correlation between IVD morphologies and the FJ loads gradually decreased, whereas the correlation between FJ morphologies and disc load gradually increased. The results suggest that early mechanical changes associated with IVD degeneration have the greatest effect on the FJ loading. With progression of degeneration, this effect is diminished, whereas the appearance of FJ degeneration increasingly influences the disc loading, which might indicate an increasing support of the disc degeneration.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We aimed to assess the biomechanical properties of spines with degenerative scoliosis, and to relate these to intervertebral disc degeneration (DD) and Cobb angle. Secondly, we compared these results to previous measurements of non-scoliotic spines. Ten cadaveric spines (Th12-L5, mean age 82 ± 11 years) with Cobb angle ≥10° and apex at L3 were acquired. Three loading cycles (-4 to 4 Nm) were applied in flexion/extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR). The range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ) stiffness, NZ ROM, elastic zone (EZ) stiffness and hysteresis were calculated for each motion segment in the loading direction. ROM was calculated in coupled directions, expressed as a percentage of rotation in the loaded direction. For Th12-L5, there was a ROM (degrees ± SD) of 14.9 ± 6.5 in FE, 14.9 ± 7.8 in LB, and 10.2 ± 5.5 in AR. The median (Nm/degree (Q1;Q3)) NZs was 0.24 (0.19;0.35) in FE, 0.25 (0.22;0.42) in LB, and 0.49 (0.33;0.99) in AR. Greater coupled motions related to higher Cobb angle, especially during AR on segments around the apex (FE: ρ = 0.539, p = 0.021 and LB: ρ = 0.821, p = 0.000). DD correlated to lower ROM and increased NZs on L2-L3 in FE (ρ = -0.721, p = 0.028 and ρ = 0.694, p = 0.038, respectively). Compared to non-scoliotic spines, smaller ROM in FE (p = 0.030) was found.

Compared to standing, this posture leads to a substantial increase in spinal loading. The lumbar spine and pelvis, however, contribute differently to the total amount of flexion, which could possibly indicate a different timing of maximum loads in both structures during flexion. This study aimed to evaluate the in vivo implant forces in the hip and lumbar spine during activities in forward bent postures. This work utilized data collected in earlier in vivo measurements on patients either with telemeterized hip endoprostheses (HE) or vertebral body replacements (VBR). The following activities were investigated: standing, upper body flexion with and without weights in the hands using different lifting techniques (straight and bent knees). The maximum resultant forces in VBR were considerably lower than in HE. Increases in flexion inclinations caused direct increases of the resultant forces within VBR, followed by a plateau or even a decrease of the force until maximum inclination. The resultant force in HE displayed an almost continuous increase until the maximum inclination. This general curve behavior resulted in different HE-VBR load ratios, which were affected by lifting additional weights or different lifting techniques. The results emphasize that maximum loads in the spine, in contrast to the hip, do not necessarily occur at maximum upper body flexion as normally expected, rather already at intermediate flexion angles in VBR patients. The results form the basis for more detailed insilico analyzes.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Intervertebral flexion/extension and AP translation (slip) at the superior adjacent segment were calculated over the entire dynamic flexion activity. Skin-mounted surface markers were tracked using conventional motion analysis and used to determine torso flexion. Change in adjacent segment kinematics after fusion was determined at corresponding angles of dynamic torso flexion. Changes in adjacent segment motion varied across patients, however, all patients maintained or increased the amount of adjacent segment slip or intervertebral flexion/extension. No patients demonstrated both decreased adjacent segment slip and decreased rotation. This study suggests that short-term changes in kinematics at the superior adjacent segment after lumbar fusion appear to be patient-specific.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the influence of maturation on postural control amongst young soccer players has neither been tested using quantitative methods, nor over a wide age range. In this study, we examined stabilometric parameters of 238 young male soccer players from 9 to 17 years old relative to maturity offset. Two 30-s tests (eyes open and eyes closed) were recorded on a baropodometric platform at 50 Hz. Participants were split into six groups according to their maturity offset, expressed as years from individual's peak height velocity. Dependent variables were: Sway Area, Center-of-Pressure velocity, standard deviation of the antero-posterior and medio-lateral Center-of-Pressure trajectory, Romberg Quotient. Sway Area was significantly higher in players with maturity offset <-1.5 than in groups with maturity offset > 0.5 years (p < 0.001, large effect). Center-of-Pressure velocity markedly dropped in players with maturity offset >-0.5 years (p < 0.001, very large effect). Antero-posterior standard deviation was higher before than after peak height velocity (p < 0.05, large effect) and significantly higher with closed eyes at some points. Medio-lateral standard deviation was higher in the youngest group of players (maturity offset <-2.5 years, large effect) than in those with maturity offset >-0.5 years. In sum, stabilometric parameters improved with age until zero maturity offset was achieved. Thereafter, variables describing postural control in developing soccer players were almost stable. No evidence of a changing role of vision in postural sway control during maturation was observed.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Literature indicates an exposure-response relation between work-related lifting and LBP. Therefore, this study investigated effects of three kinds of real-time feedback on low-back load, quantified as lumbar moments, during lifting. We recruited 97 healthy male and female participants without a recent history of LBP and without prior biomechanical knowledge on lifting. Participants were assigned to groups based on the time of enrollment, filling the four groups in the following order: moment feedback, trunk inclination angle feedback, lumbar flexion feedback, and a control group not receiving feedback. Feedback was given by a sound when a threshold level of the input variable was exceeded. Participants were unaware of the input variable for the feedback, but were instructed to try to avoid the audio feedback by changing their lifting strategy. The groups with feedback were able to reduce the audio feedback and thus changed the input variable towards a more desired level. Lumbar moments significantly decreased over trials in the inclination and moment feedback groups, remained similar in the lumbar flexion group and increased in the control group. Between group comparisons revealed that low-back load was significantly lower in the moment and inclination groups compared to the control group. Additionally, moments were lower in the inclination group than in the lumbar flexion group. Real-time feedback on moments or trunk inclination is a promising tool to reduce low-back load during lifting and lowering.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Alteration in the L/P ratio is an important indicator for low back pain (LBP). Previous studies demonstrated sex-dependent differences in LBP prevalence during lifting activities. However, the sex-dependent differences in the L/P ratio during different lifting tasks has to data not been investigated. An optoelectronic system was used to measure the sagittal lumbo-pelvic motion in 10 males and 10 females. Task A was lifting one weight from the ground in front of the body to three target heights with straight knees (A1-3: abdomen, chest and head levels, respectively). Task B was lifting two identical weights from the ground at the sides of the body to three target angles with bended knees (B1-3: arms close and 45° and 90° abducted to the trunk, respectively). Lifts of 10 kg (males and females) and 20 kg (males only) were performed and three phases were investigated: Phase 1 - pure flexion without load, Phase 2 - lifting up weights, Phase 3 - lowering down weights. Females generally displayed a smaller L/P ratio than males. In Phases 2 and 3, the L/P ratio was greater than in Phase 1 for Tasks A and B. The L/P ratio increased with a greater lifting height for Task B, but displayed no difference neither between lifting 10 kg and 20 kg, nor between weight lifting and lowering for both tasks. These results can provide indications for sex-specific recommendations for safer lifting activities.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While the harmonic components, generated by the oscillatory motion of the vocal folds, are well described by reduced-order speech models, the accurate computation of the inharmonic components requires high-order flow simulations, which predict the vortex shedding and turbulent structures present in the shear layers of the glottal jet. This study characterizes the dominant frequencies in the unsteady flow of the intra- and supraglottal region. A realistic vocal tract geometry obtained through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is applied for the numerical domain, which is locally modified to account for different convergent and divergent glottal angles. Both time-averaged and fluctuating values of the flow variables are computed and their distribution at various glottal shapes is compared. The impact of the registered modes in the unsteady flow on the acoustic far field is computed through direct compressible flow simulations.

The IDM can replace stickers (decals) that normally attach to the exterior of a football helmet. The IDM decals reduce friction and catch points between the covered area with the IDM on the outer shell of the helmet and the impacting surface, thereby decreasing rotational acceleration acting on the player's head. A Riddell Speed helmet's exterior was prepared with the IDM and outfitted to a headform equipped with linear accelerometers and gyroscopes. The helmets were tested at an impact velocity of 5.5 m/s at 15°, 30°, and 45° to the vertical: on the front, side, and back of the helmet. Results of 135 impact tests in the lab show that the IDM decal, when compared to helmets without it, reduced the rotational acceleration, rotational velocity, SI, HIC, and RIC ranging from 22% to 77%, 20% to 74%, 13% to 68%, 7% to 68%, 31% to 94%, respectively. Protection against rotational acceleration from oblique impacts is not prioritized in modern football helmets, as evident by current standard helmet testing protocols. This study demonstrates that the inclusion of the IDM decals in football helmets can help reduce the effects of rotational acceleration of the head during oblique impacts.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

By employing experimental and computational approaches, many studies have investigated the relative role of each component as well as effects of various factors such as boundary-initial conditions, load magnitude-combination-direction, load temporal regime, preload, posture, degeneration, failures and surgical interventions on load-sharing. This paper reviews and critically discusses the relevant findings of in vitro and finite element model studies on load-sharing in healthy, aged, degenerate and damaged human lumbar motion segments. Two systematic searches were performed in PubMed (October 2018 - March 2019) using three sets of concepts (""lumbar spine"", ""load-sharing"" and ""motion segment components"") followed by a complementary generic search. The segment overall response as well as the relative role of its constituents are markedly influenced by alterations in resection sequence, boundary conditions, geometry, loading characteristics (rate, magnitude, combinations and preloads), disc hydration, bone quality, posture and time (creep and cyclic). Structural transection order affects both findings and conclusions not only in force-control protocols but also in displacement-control loading regimes. Disc degeneration, endplate fracture and surgical resections significantly alter load transmission in the lumbar spine. In summary, in vitro and finite element model studies have together substantially improved our understanding of functional biomechanics (load-sharing) of human lumbar spine in normal and perturbed conditions acting as invaluable complementary tools in clinical applications.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We assumed that the tube wall (i.e. alveolar or pulmonary capillary wall) is thicker than its normal size due to fibrosis and chemical species may go through linear first-order kinetic reactions, one is reversible phase exchange with the wall material and other is irreversible absorption into the tube wall. By considering diffusivity as a function of thickness, the dispersion can be calculated by the distribution of concentration of gas along a tube. Mathematical modeling is done by using diffusion equation; and effects of various dimensionless parameters e.g., the Damkohler number (DA), phase partitioning number (α), dimensionless absorption number (Γ), thickness and permeability of wall are observed. Numerical simulation shows that the diffusion rate through the respiratory wall is decreased significantly as the thickness of wall increases, while it increased with the increment in the porosity of wall, the concentration of species increased when the tube wall thickness increases; which cause reduction in the spread of the species; additionally, the dispersion coefficient achieves the steady-state values in a very short time when 0 < DA ⩽1 and absorption rate < 1, while for 1 < DA ⩽20 and absorption rate = 1 long time dispersion is achieved.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While joint coupling differences have been reported during gait in patients with CAI, there is no known research assessing joint coupling during a drop-vertical jumping (DVJ). Joint coupling variability measure may provide information on the sensorimotor health of these patients. The purpose of this study was to compare lower extremity joint coupling variability during a DVJ between patients with CAI and controls. Twenty-eight young, active individuals (CAI:n = 14, Control:n = 14) participated in the study. A 3D motion capture system was used to collect kinematics during 15 drop-vertical jump trials. A vector coding analysis was used to assess the variability in the following joint couples: knee sagittal-ankle frontal, knee sagittal-ankle sagittal, hip frontal-ankle frontal, and hip frontal-ankle sagittal. The CAI group had higher joint coupling variability in hip frontal-ankle sagittal, knee sagittal-ankle frontal and knee sagittal-ankle sagittal planes both prior to and following ground contact during the drop vertical jumps. These changes indicate potential adaptations to the constraint of CAI and the task of the DVJ. Higher variability may reflect an attempt by the subjects to explore alternate movement strategies or reflect poor sensorimotor control strategies.

Accurate determination of these events is thus an essential component of 3D motion recordings processing. Several methods have been developed for the automatic detection of these events (based on the heuristics of 3D marker position, velocity and acceleration), however the results may be inaccurate due to the high variability that is intrinsic to pathological gait. For this reason, gait events are still commonly determined manually, which is a tedious process. Here we propose a new application (DeepEvent) of a long short term memory recurrent neural network for the automatic detection of gait events. The 3D position and velocity of the markers on the heel, toe and lateral malleolus were used by the network to determine FS and FO. The method was developed from 10526 FS and 9375 FO from 226 children. DeepEvent predicted FS within 5.5 ms and FO within 10.7 ms of the gold standard (automatic determination using force platform data) and was more accurate than common heuristic marker trajectory-based methods proposed in the literature and another deep learning method. A sensitivity analysis showed that DeepEvent mainly used the toe and heel markers (z-axis (longitudinal) position and velocity) at the beginning and end of gait cycle to predict FS, and the toe marker (x-axis (anterior/posterior) velocity and z-axis position and velocity) at around 60% of the gait cycle to predict FO.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

It is a necessary first step to understand the capabilities and limitations in any testing machine prior to publishing experimental data. In this study, a reproducible protocol that uses a synthetic spine was developed and used to quantify the inherent rotation error and the ability to apply loads in a single physiologic plane (pure-moment) of a custom spine biomechanics simulator. Rotation error was evaluated by comparing data collected by the test machine and the data collected by an optical motion capture system. Pure-moment loading was assessed by comparing the out-of-plane loads to the primary plane load. Using synthetic functional spine units previously shown to have mechanics similar to the cadaveric human spine, the simulator was evaluated using a dynamic test protocol reflective of its future use in the study of cadaveric spine specimens. Rotation errors inherent in the test machine were <0.25° compared to motion capture. Out of plane loads were <4.0% of the primary plane load, which confirmed pure-moment loading. The authors suggest that a standard validation protocol for biomechanical spine testing machines is needed for transparency and accurate field-wide data interpretation and comparison.

This study investigated the relationship between the shear modulus and passive tension in the posterior shoulder capsule using SWE. Ten posterior middle and ten posterior inferior shoulder capsules were dissected from ten fresh-frozen cadavers; humeral head-capsule-glenoid specimens were created from each capsule. The humeral head and glenoid were immobilized with clamps in a custom-built device. Loads (0-400 g, in 25-g increments) were applied to each capsule via a pulley system; elasticity was simultaneously measured using SWE. The elasticity-load relationship of each tested capsule was analyzed by fitting a least-squares regression line to the data. Elasticity change due to creep or hysteresis effects was evaluated by comparing the elastic modulus for a 100-g load during and after the stepwise application of the loads. The observed relationship between the shear modulus and passive capsule tension was highly linear for all twenty tested capsules (p < 0.01). The mean coefficient of determination was 0.882 ± 0.075 and 0.901 ± 0.050 for the posterior middle and posterior inferior capsules, respectively. There was no difference in the shear modulus between the two 100-g load assessments for both the posterior middle (p = 0.205) and posterior inferior capsules (p = 0.161).

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the inertial parameters of the lower limb during landing and stamping tasks using high frequency three-dimensional motion analysis. Seven males performed active and passive drop landings from 30 and 45 cm and a stamp onto a force plate. A sixteen-camera 750 Hz Vicon system recorded markers for standard rigid body analysis using inverse kinematics in Visual 3D and 7 × 8 and 7 × 9 marker arrays on the shank and thigh. Frame by frame segment volumes from marker arrays were calculated as a collection of tetrahedra using the Delaunay triangulation method in 3D and further inertial parameters were calculated using the method of Tonon (2004). Distance between the centres of mass (COM) of the rigid and soft tissues changed during impact in a structured manner indicative of a damped oscillation. Group mean amplitudes for COM motion of the soft tissues relative to the rigid body of up to 1.4 cm, and changes of up to 17% in moment of inertia of the soft tissue about the rigid body COM were found.

Sarcomerogenesis following EC is thought to be a protective muscle adaptation, preventing muscle injury in future eccentric exercise bouts (repeated bout effect). However, the mechanisms underlying sarcomerogenesis in EC remain unknown, and the sarcomerogenic responses observed in response to EC and CC are contradictory. We measured sarcomere length, sarcomere length uniformity, serial sarcomere number, and fascicle length in gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in sedentary (SED) mice, and in mice following protocols of moderate uphill (TRU) and downhill (TRD) training and uphill (OTU) and downhill (OTD) overtraining. We found pain sensitivity after the first bout of EC exercise on TRD and OTD followed by a normalized sensory response after four weeks of training, indicating a repeated bout effect. However, these findings were not associated with sarcomerogenesis, as serial sarcomere numbers did not increase in TRD and OTD skeletal muscle samples compared to controls (SED). However, we found a decrease in serial sarcomere number in VL and TA in OTU group mice, which was associated with a decrease in fascicle length and no change of sarcomere length at the tested joint configuration. We conclude that excessive concentric muscle contraction (OTU group mice), leads to a decrease in serial sarcomere number, while moderate or excessive eccentric training, did not result in sarcomerogenesis, as reported in the literature.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Participants were randomized to either exercise (E), intensive diet-induced weight loss (D), or intensive diet-induced weight loss plus exercise (D + E) interventions. We previously reported that the clinical benefits of D + E were significantly greater than with either intervention alone (e.g., greater pain reduction, and better function, mobility, and health-related quality of life). We now test the hypothesis that D + E has greater overall benefit on gait mechanics compared to either intervention alone. Knee joint loading was analyzed using inverse dynamics and musculoskeletal modeling. Analysis of covariance determined the interventions' effects on gait. The D + E group walked significantly faster at 18-month follow-up (1.35 m s-1) than E (1.29 m s-1, p = 0.0004) and D (1.31 m s-1, p = 0.0007). Tibiofemoral compressive impulse was significantly lower (p = 0.0007) in D (1069 N s) and D + E (1054 N s) compared to E (1130 N s). D had significantly lower peak hip external rotation moment (p = 0.01), hip abduction moment (p = 0.0003), and peak hip power production (p = 0.016) compared with E. Peak ankle plantar flexion moment was significantly less (p < 0.0001) in the two diet groups compared with E. There also was a significant dose-response to weight loss; participants that lost >10% of baseline body weight had significantly (p = 0.0001) lower resultant knee forces and lower muscle (quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius) forces than participants that had less weight loss. Compared to E, D produces significant load reductions at the hip, knee, and ankle; combining D with E attenuates these reductions, but most remain significantly better than with E alone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Experiments have demonstrated that permanent deformation and damage take place in the tissue under mechanical loads. Development of an accurate model to capture the complex behaviour of AF tissue is hence crucial in disc model studies. We, therefore, aimed to develop a non-homogenous model to capture elastic, inelastic and failure responses of the AF tissue and the entire disc model under axial load. Our model estimations satisfactorily agreed with results of existing uniaxial (along fiber, circumferential and axial directions) and biaxial tissue-level tests. The model accurately predicted the failure of the tissue in various directions in uniaxial extension. Collagen fiber content, type and orientation substantially altered AF tissue responses in uni- and bi-axial tests. Although collagen fiber content and type mostly affected failure stress, fiber orientation significantly influenced the tissue failure strain. The entire L2-L3 disc model accurately replicated load-displacement as well as loading-unloading responses of the disc under compression-tension forces. Preconditioning of the disc-body unit substantially stiffened response. Poisson's ratio of both AF and nucleus considerably affected compression-displacement responses of the disc (173% increase in compression at 1.49 mm displacement when it was changed from 0.499 to 0.49999). Any AF constitutive model should be calibrated under various tissue-level loads and directions as well as the entire disc model responses since using a single tissue-level loading (e.g. uniaxial) for calibration can lead to unrealistic responses in other tests (e.g., biaxial). Special attentions should be given to the choice of Poisson's ratio and the realistic consideration of preconditioning load.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Existing microstructural models do not capture the full three-dimensional response while models suitable for application in finite element environments mostly have a limited microstructural basis and cannot capture the observed Poisson's ratios. The aim of this paper is to derive an inverse model based on the microstructure of a skeletal muscle that can predict its passive mechanical response. The model parameters and predictions were derived and assessed by comparison with published experimental stress-strain response and Poisson's ratio data. Results show a close match for both predicted stress-strain response for fibre and cross-fibre direction deformations and similar Poisson's ratio values.

Reliability studies on landing mechanics of such maneuvers are however lacking. This study investigated feasibility and within-session reliability of landing mechanics of a novel one-leg double-hop test, mimicking a land-and-cut maneuver, in individuals with ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Our test comprised a forward hop followed by a diagonal hop in either of two directions (medial/lateral) under anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Twenty individuals with a unilateral ACLR (aged 24.2 ± 4.2 years, 0.7-10.8 years post-surgery) performed three successful hops/direction per leg. We determined reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and agreement (standard error of measurement [SEM]) of 3-dimensional hip and knee angles and moments during the deceleration phase of the land-and-cut maneuver (vulnerable for non-contact ACL injuries). Mean success rate for unanticipated hops was 71-77% and for anticipated hops 91-95%. Both limbs demonstrated moderate-excellent reliability (ICC 95% confidence intervals: 0.50-0.99) for almost all hip and knee peak angles and moments in all planes and conditions, with a few exceptions: poor-good reliability for hip and knee frontal and/or transverse plane variables, especially for lateral diagonal hops. The SEMs were ≤5° and ≤0.23 N·m/kg·m for most peak angles and moments, respectively. Our test seems feasible and showed satisfactory reliability for most hip and knee angles and moments; however, low knee abduction and internal rotation angles and moments, and moderate reliability of these moments deserve consideration. The test appears to challenge dynamic knee control and may prove valuable in evaluation during knee rehabilitation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Exoskeletons have been introduced in the workplace to reduce low back loading. During static forward bending, exoskeletons have been shown to reduce back muscle activity by 10% to 40%. However, effects during dynamic lifting are not well documented. Relative support of the exoskeleton might be smaller in lifting compared to static bending due to higher peak loads. In addition, exoskeletons might also result in changes in lifting behavior, which in turn could affect low back loading. The present study investigated the effect of a passive exoskeleton on peak compression forces, moments, muscle activity and kinematics during symmetric lifting. Two types (LOW and HIGH) of the device, which generate peak support moments at large and moderate flexion angles, respectively, were tested during lifts from knee and ankle height from a near and far horizontal position, with a load of 10 kg. Both types of the trunk exoskeleton tested here reduced the peak L5S1 compression force by around 5-10% for lifts from the FAR position from both KNEE and ANKLE height. Subjects did adjust their lifting style when wearing the device with a 17% reduced peak trunk angular velocity and 5 degrees increased lumbar flexion, especially during ANKLE height lifts. In conclusion, the exoskeleton had a minor and varying effect on the peak L5S1 compression force with only significant differences in the FAR lifts.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In the event that fresh tissues are not readily available, alternative measures, such as storing fresh specimens at -80 °C, could be considered. Previous studies have shown that changes in the mechanical properties of the tissues due to freezing could be tissue-dependent. Prior to our study, however, such information was not available for the tricuspid valve leaflets. As such, for the first time, we examined whether fresh porcine specimens tested in a biaxial tensile machine would offer comparable results after being frozen at -80 °C. The stress-strain response of the tricuspid valve leaflets displayed no major deviation of the post-frozen leaflets as compared to fresh leaflets. We further compared the radial and circumferential strains as an indicator of deformation at similar stress states in fresh and thawed tissues, and we did not find any significant differences. Ice formation within the extra cellular matrix may modify the collagen fiber configuration, resulting in a slight change in the mechanical response. Nevertheless, our results indicated such a small deviation was negligible, thus enabling the possibility of using frozen porcine tricuspid valve specimens for future research.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The range of motion (ROM) deficit in knee extension is often measured and reported at a single torque value applied in the flexion-extension axis. This static measurement of ROM omits key details about the biomechanical properties of the knee, such as its mechanical stiffness. Our objectives were (1) to quantify knee extension stiffness after various periods of immobilization and remobilization, and (2) to evaluate how stiffness correlated with the length of the posterior knee capsule. Two hundred fifty-six male Sprague Dawley rats had one knee immobilized at a 45° angle in flexion using a Delrin® plate for 6 different durations ranging from 1 to 32 weeks. Remobilization was initiated by removing the plate and lasted for 0-48 weeks. The contralateral knee and unoperated age-matched rats were used as controls. An automated arthrometer extended the knee at four pre-determined torques and these data were used to calculate mechanical stiffness. The stiffness of knees immobilized for 8 or more weeks was significantly greater than controls and persisted despite remobilization (p < 0.05). Remobilization after 16 and 32 weeks of immobilization resulted in a progressive increase in mechanical stiffness (p < 0.05). The length of the posterior capsule significantly correlated with knee stiffness in extension (p < 0.05). Deficit in knee extension was characterized by increased stiffness, which was irreversible upon unassisted remobilization.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Kinematic methods exist; however, accuracy of these methods in stroke survivors during treadmill and overground walking is unknown. Thus, this study compared the accuracy of three kinematic methods during overground and treadmill walking in stroke survivors. Heel strike and toe off were calculated bilaterally using three kinematic methods (horizontal sacral-heel distance, horizontal ankle-heel distance, and horizontal velocity) and a kinetic method for ten stroke survivors. We calculated true and absolute error for each kinematic method relative to the kinetic method to evaluate accuracy. Repeated-measures ANOVAs compared the absolute error between the different methods for each condition. There was a significant effect of method for all conditions except heel strike during treadmill walking. Post hoc tests showed ankle-heel distance detected heel strike with significantly less error than the other methods during overground walking (p < 0.05). Ankle-heel distance identified 93.0% and 77.8% of gait events within 50 ms of the kinetic event for overground and treadmill walking, respectively. Sacral-heel distance detected toe-off with significantly less error than the other methods during overground and treadmill walking (p < 0.05) and identified 87.2% and 90.3% of gait events within 50 ms of the kinetic event for overground and treadmill walking, respectively.

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a surgical reorientation of the acetabulum to normalize coverage, yet its effect on joint loading is unknown. Our objective was to establish how PAO, simulated with a musculoskeletal model and probabilistic analysis, alters hip joint reaction forces (JRF) in two representative patients of two different acetabular dysplasia subgroups: anterolateral and posterolateral coverage deficiencies. PAO reorientation was simulated within the musculoskeletal model by adding three surgical degrees of freedom to the acetabulum relative to the pelvis (acetabular adduction, acetabular extension, medial translation of the hip joint center). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to generate 2000 unique PAO reorientations for each patient; from which 99% confidence bounds and sensitivity factors were calculated to assess the influence of input variability (PAO reorientation) on output (hip JRF) during gait. Our results indicate that reorientation of the acetabulum alters the lines of action of the hip musculature. Specifically, as the hip joint center was medialized, the moment arm of the hip abductor muscles was increased, which in turn increased the mechanical force-generating capacity of these muscles and decreased joint loading. Independent of subgroup, hip JRF was most sensitive to hip joint center medialization. Results from this study improve understanding of how PAO reorientation affects muscle function differently dependent upon acetabular dysplasia subgrouping and can be used to inform more targeted surgical interventions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Using our validated finite element-musculoskeletal (FE-MS) model of lower extremity, we investigate the sensitivity of knee anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), muscle, and contact forces plus stability to the reported scatter in asymptomatic gait data. Three highly loaded stance instants (25, 50 and 75%) with five levels (mean, ±0.5SD and ±SD) for each of six knee joint angles-moments are used employing Taguchi approach (25 experiments) and regression equations. ACL force drops significantly at larger flexion angles (all periods) and smaller internal moment (at 75% only) but increases with the flexion moment. Tibiofemoral (TF) medial-lateral contact force partitioning is found, contrary to the common claim, most sensitive to changes in the adduction angle and not in the adduction moment. Total TF contact force increases significantly at greater moments (but not angles), especially in the sagittal plane. Forces in lateral hamstrings are significantly influenced by changes in adduction angles-moments. Larger flexion moments (at 25 and 50%) significantly increase forces in quadriceps and on patellofemoral (PF) contact. Sagittal moment, adduction moment (at 75%) and flexion angle (at 25%) contribute most to the joint stability.

Ten side impact tests previously performed using seven PMHS under 3 m/s and 8 m/s impact velocities were selected for model evaluation. With weight, stature, sex, and age of PMHS, seven FE HBMs were developed by morphing the midsize male THUMS model into the target geometries predicted by the statistical skeleton and external body shape models. The model-predicted force histories, accelerations along the spine, and deflections in the chest and abdomen were compared to the test data. For comparison, simulations in all testing conditions were also conducted with the original midsize male THUMS, and the results from the THUMS simulations were scaled to the weight and stature from each PMHS.

All subjects underwent MRI and Noninvasive Optimal Vessel Analysis (NOVA) to obtain patient-specific vascular morphology and flow measurements of all major cerebral arteries for validation. The mathematical model used was based on the Hagen-Poiseuille equations. Proximal boundary conditions were patient-specific blood pressure cuff measurements. For distal boundary conditions, a structured tree and a simple autoregulatory model were applied. Autoregulatory parameters were optimized based on the data of 10 additional healthy subjects. A median percentual flow difference of -3% (interquartile range -36% to 17%) was found. Regression analysis to an identity line resulted in R2 values of 0.71 for absolute flow values. Bland-Altman plots showed a bias (levels of agreement) of 5% (-70 to 80%) for absolute flow. Based on these results the model proved to be accurate within a range that might be feasible for use in clinic.

The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) increases substantially with age, in part due to clinically identified deterioration of PFM function with age. However, the etiology of this decline remains largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that PFMs undergo age-related fibrotic changes. This study sought to determine whether aging also impacts PFMs' passive mechanical properties that are largely determined by the intramuscular extracellular matrix. Biopsies from younger (≤52y) and older (>52y) female cadaveric donors were procured from PFMs, specifically coccygeus (C) and two portions of the levator ani - iliococcygeus (IC) and pubovisceralis (PV), and the appendicular muscles - obturator internus (OI) and vastus lateralis (VL).

The fenestration structure consists of a main endograft and a left subclavian artery (LSA) stent-graft. The purpose of this study is to assess the biomechanical implications of the protruding segment (PS) of the LSA stent-graft after TEVAR with in situ fenestration (ISF-TEVAR). The PS is characterized by the protruding length and centerline angle between the LSA and PS. An idealized three-dimensional geometric model of the human aorta was constructed as the reference benchmark. We designed nine postoperative aortic geometries with different protruding lengths (5, 10, 15 mm) and centerline angles (-20°, 0°, +20°). The blood was assumed to be non-Newtonian and the three-element Windkessel model was applied to reproduce physiological pressure waveforms. The interaction between the blood and vessel wall was captured by a two-way fluid-structure method. We also considered the impact of the fenestration structure on the vessel wall. Long protruding length (15 mm) and the retrograde angle (+20°) result in a markedly reduced LSA flow ratio (1.3%). There is a pressure difference between the inner and outer walls of the PS. The region around the PS is more prone to thrombosis. The flow stability and turbulence intensity of downstream blood of the PS gradually deteriorate. The largest deformed region moves from the aortic arch to the ascending aorta after ISF-TEVAR. The postoperative hemodynamics largely depends on the protruding length and angle of the LSA stent-graft. The configurations should be carefully controlled during ISF-TEVAR.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This joint coupling-perspective allows more insight into two age-related phenomena during gait. First, whether increased hip kinetic output compensates for decreased ankle kinetic output during positive joint work. Second, whether preserved joint kinetic patterns during negative joint work in older age have any functional implication. Therefore, we examined how age and surface inclination affect joint moment strategies to accelerate and/or decelerate individual leg joints during walking. Healthy young (age: 22.5 ± 4.1 years, n = 18) and older (age: 76.0 ± 5.7 years, n = 22) adults walked at 1.4 m/s on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at three grades (0%, 10%, -10%). Lower-extremity moment-induced angular accelerations were calculated for the hip (0% and 10%) and knee (0% and -10%) joints. During level and uphill walking, both age groups showed comparable ankle moment-induced ipsilateral (p = 0.774) and contralateral (p = 0.047) hip accelerations, although older adults generated lower ankle moments in late stance. However, ankle moment-induced contralateral hip accelerations were smaller (p = 0.001) in an older adult subgroup (n = 13) who showed larger hip extension moments in early stance than young adults. During level and downhill walking, leg joint moment-induced knee accelerations were unaffected by age (all p > 0.05). These findings suggest that during level and uphill walking increased hip flexor mechanical output in older adults does not arise from reduced ankle moments, contrary to increased hip extensor mechanical output. Additionally, results during level and downhill walking imply that preserved eccentric knee extensor function is important in maintaining knee stabilization in older age.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These tasks are physically arduous and are believed to be the primary cause of musculoskeletal injury. Physical training can help mitigate injury risk when specifically designed to address injury mechanisms and meet task demands. This study aimed to assess lower-limb biomechanics and neuromuscular adaptations during load carriage walking in response to a 10-week evidence-based physical training program. Thirteen male civilian participants donned 23 kg and completed 5 km of load carriage treadmill walking, at 5.5 km h-1 before and after a 10-week physical training program. Three-dimensional motion capture and force plate data were acquired in over-ground walking trials before and after treadmill walking. These data were inputs to a musculoskeletal model which estimated lower-limb joint kinematics and kinetics (i.e., moments and powers) using inverse kinematics and dynamics, respectively. A two-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effect of training for kinematic and kinetics parameters at the knee and ankle joints (p < 0.05). Post-Hoc comparisons demonstrated a significant decrease (4.2%) in total negative knee power between pre- and post-March 5 km measures after training (p < 0.05). Positive power contribution shifted distally after training, increasing at the post-march measure from 39.9% to 43.6% at the ankle joint (p < 0.05).

Stresses within intervertebral discs, ligaments, and passive muscles are thought to support this moment thereby allowing the extensor muscles to 'turn off'. While the mechanical behaviour of the intervertebral disc and ligaments have been studied extensively, less is known regarding the moment supported by passive muscle tissue during spine flexion. Here we estimated the L4/L5 moment supported by the passive musculature during spine flexion based on experimentally derived architectural and material properties. We then tested the validity of the passive muscle prediction by determining whether the cumulative passive tissue moment (including passive muscle, intervertebral discs, and ligaments) would support the extensor moment demand-calculated with inverse dynamics-near maximum spine flexion. The model predicted that the passive tissues were able to support the entire extensor moment demand, indicating that muscle activity was not required to support the weight of the upper body, consistent with the mechanism of flexion relaxation. The model further demonstrated that despite being inactive, spine muscles still greatly contribute to flexion relaxation by passively supporting ~47% of the extensor moment demand on the spine. Finally, there was strong agreement between the predicted active muscle moments and the recorded spine muscle activity (EMG); this strong agreement persisted when the external moment was manipulated using a pulley-system. These findings provide additional confidence that the estimated passive muscle moments are reasonably accurate throughout spine flexion.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The consequences of an age-related reduction in muscle mass have not been fully investigated and, therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the muscle and joint contact forces using musculoskeletal modelling, during a sit-to-stand activity, to better explain difficulties in performing everyday activities for older people. A sit-to-stand activity with and without the use of arm rests was observed in ninety-five male participants, placed into groups of young (aged 18-35 years), middle-aged (aged 40-60 years) or older adults (aged 65 years and over). Older participants demonstrated significantly lower knee extensor and joint forces than the young when not using arm rests, compensating through elevated hip extensor and ankle plantarflexor muscle activity. The older group were also found to have higher shoulder joint contact forces whilst using arm rests. This tendency to reorganise muscle recruitment to include neighbouring groups or other parts of the body could make everyday activities more susceptible to age-related functional decline. Reductions in leg strength, via age- or atrophy- related means, creates increased reliance on the upper body and may result in further lower limb atrophy through disuse. The eventual decline of upper body function reduces strength reserves, leading to increased vulnerability, dependence on others and risk of institutionalisation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This method relies on spring-mass model and measurements of average horizontal velocity, and contact and flight times during running. Ten male, recreational subjects ran on a dynamometer treadmill at different velocities ranging from 2.22 to 4.44 m·s-1 during 4 min 30 s for each velocity. Twenty consecutive steps were analyzed after 3 min 30 s. The potential (Wpot), forward kinetic (Wkinf) and the total center of mass (Wext) work data obtained with this new method were compared with the reference data calculated from ground reaction force measurements. Wext, Wpot and Wkinf values calculated with the proposed method were respectively +3.39 ± 0.77% higher, -4.14 ± 0.72% lower and +7.34 ± 1.08% higher than values obtained by the reference method. Furthermore, significant linear regressions close to the identity line were obtained between the reference and the proposed method values of works (r = 0.99, p < 0.05 for Wext; r = 0.98, p < 0.05 for Wpot; r = 0.98, p < 0.05 for Wkinf).

This study presents a more accessible method for researchers to optimise sclera material parameters for use in finite element studies where macroscale sclera displacements are required. Five human donor sclerae aged between 36 and 72 years were subjected to cycles of internal pressure up to 61 mmHg using a custom-built inflation rig. Displacements were measured using a laser beam and two cameras through a digital image correlation algorithm. Specimen-specific finite element models incorporating regional thickness variation and sclera surface topography were divided into six circumferential regions. An inverse finite element procedure was used to optimise Ogden material parameters for each region. The maximum root mean squared (RMS) error between the numerical and experimental displacements within individual specimens was 17.5 µm. The optimised material parameters indicate a gradual reduction in material stiffness (as measured by the tangent modulus) from the equator to the posterior region at low-stress levels up to 0.005 MPa. The variation in stiffness between adjacent regions became gradually less apparent and statistically insignificant at higher stresses. The study demonstrated how inflation testing combined with inverse modelling could be used to effectively characterise regional material properties capable of reproducing global sclera displacements. The material properties were found to vary between specimens, and it is expected that age could be a contributing factor behind this variation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Based on published in vitro data of individual intervertebral joint flexibility, multi-level six degree-of-freedom nonlinear stiffness of functional spinal units was modelled and incorporated in a rigid-body model of the thoracolumbar spine. To estimate physiological in vivo conditions of the entire spine, stiffening effects caused by directly applied compressive loads, and contributions to mono-segmental stiffness from the rib cage as well as multi-segmental interactions in the thoracic spine were analysed and implemented. Forward dynamic simulations were performed to simulate in vitro tests that measured the load-displacement response of the spine under various loading conditions. The predicted kinematic responses of the model were in agreement with in vitro measurements, with correlations between simulated and measured segmental displacements varying between 0.66 and 0.97 (p < 0.05) and average deviations below 1.6°. Coupling relationships were found between lateral bending and axial rotation. Under compressive loads, the model behaved stiffer and showed a decreased range of motion: The flexion/extension response of the full thoracolumbar spine under compressive loads up to 800 N was found to strongly correlate with the literature (r = 0.99, p < 0.0001).

However, quantifying trailing limb propulsion requires sophisticated measurement equipment at significant expense that fundamentally limits clinical translation for diagnostics or gait rehabilitation. As a component of joint power, our purpose was to determine if shank acceleration estimated via accelerometers during push-off can serve as a clinically feasible surrogate for ankle power output and peak anterior ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking. As hypothesized, we found that young adults modulated walking speed via changes in peak anterior GRF and peak ankle power output that correlated with proportional changes in shank acceleration during push-off, both at the individual subject (R2 ≥ 0.80, p < 0.01) and group average (R2 ≥ 0.74, p < 0.01) levels. In addition, we found that unilateral deficits in trailing limb propulsion induced via a leg bracing elicited unilateral and relatively proportional reductions in peak anterior GRF, peak ankle power, and peak shank acceleration. These unilateral leg bracing effects on peak shank acceleration correlated with those in peak ankle power (braced leg: R2 = 0.43, p = 0.028) but those effects in both peak shank acceleration and peak ankle power were disassociated from those in peak anterior GRF.

To obtain these measurements, models of the femur, tibia, and associated ACL attachment sites were created from magnetic resonance (MR) images in 10 healthy subjects. ACL attachment sites were subdivided into anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles. High-speed biplanar radiographs were obtained as subjects ambulated at 1 m/s. The bone models were registered to the radiographs, thereby reproducing the in vivo positions of the bones and ACL attachment sites throughout gait. The lengths of the ACL and both bundles were estimated as straight line distances between attachment sites for each knee position. Increased attachment to attachment ACL length and strain were observed during midstance (length = 28.5 ± 2.6 mm, strain = 5 ± 4%, mean ± standard deviation), and heel strike (length = 30.5 ± 3.0 mm, strain = 12 ± 5%) when the knee was positioned at low flexion angles.

Mode I fracture tests revealed that physiological variations in the bath osmolarity do not influence the tear resistance of amnion, while larger changes, i.e. from physiological saline solution to distilled water, lead to a significant reduction of the fracture toughness. Uniaxial tensile tests on collagen hydrogels confirmed the reduction in toughness, suggesting that lower bath osmolarity triggers changes in the failure properties of single collagen fibers.

Common variables to assess foot posture/movement are the Foot Posture Index (FPI-6), Achilles tendon angle (β), rear foot angle (γ) and longitudinal arch angle (LAA). These variables were frequently used in clinical and biomechanical settings. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the biomechanical variables (β, γ & LAA) in static and dynamic conditions and the clinically used FPI-6 and their redundancy. Forty participants performed bipedal standing, over ground walking and running trials. Manual assessment data (FPI-6), kinematic data and ground reaction forces were collected. Discrete biomechanical variables (β, γ & LAA) were calculated at various time points (e.g. heel strike). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to quantify the contribution of each variable to the overall variance in the data set. Spearman correlations were used to assess the relationship between the sub-measures of the FPI-6 and the biomechanical variables. Two major components were found that explained 85.2% of the overall variance, consisting of LAA and β variables, respectively. Only LAA variables showed significant, but moderate correlations (r < -0.6) with the fifth sub-measurement of the FPI-6. The LAA and β describe independent movements, which dominate foot posture/movement in static and dynamic conditions.

Nineteen healthy adults performed six walking trials and ten cycles of foot PROSUP movements recorded by an optoelectronic system. Rearfoot's and forefoot's coordinate system were equal for all setups, only the forefoot's tracking markers locations varied among them, which were: (1st) a typical cluster, focusing on the proximal forefoot, (2nd) a second typical cluster, focusing on the distal forefoot and outer metatarsals, and (3rd) a new cluster proposition, focusing on the distal forefoot and central metatarsals. Cluster rigidity was the normalized intra-markers residual, and forefoot - rearfoot angles were the forefoot motion relative to the rearfoot at the peak of each plane of motion. Repeated-measures ANOVA with pairwise comparisons (α=0.05) revealed that the 3rd cluster had the smallest residual (p < 0.001) in comparison with the other clusters for both walking and PROSUP. Differences between forefoot - rearfoot angles were found in the sagittal plane for walking (p < 0.001), but not for PROSUP (p > 0.686). In the frontal and transverse planes, all clusters showed different forefoot - rearfoot angles (p < 0.001) for both walking and PROSUP. The 1st cluster showed smaller ROM in the three planes during walking, and the 3rd cluster was the only that showed forefoot - rearfoot inversion during maximum pronation.

Retrieval and in-vitro studies have identified micromotion between the taper components to accelerate the corrosion process. The aim of this study was to identify the most critical factors contributing to increased micromotion, which is most likely influenced by design-, patient- and surgeon-related aspects. Micromotion between head and stem taper surfaces was measured for different taper surface topographies and load orientations. Consecutive visual images were recorded through windows in the head component. By image matching analysis the local micromotions at the taper junction between head and stem tapers were determined. To extend the findings to taper regions not visible through the windows, finite element models were generated. The models were further utilized to investigate the influence of head length, taper angle difference and assembly force on micromotion. Significantly higher micromotion (+20%) was found under varus loading (7.1 µm) in comparison to valgus loading (5.9 µm). Smooth and microgrooved stem tapers exhibited equal amounts of micromotion. The numerical model revealed head tilting and recurring taper contact changes in terms of cyclic engagement/disengagement during the loading sequences.

It is well known that compartment pressure is an important factor for diagnosing fasciotomy. However, the current technology to measure the pressure using a needle-catheter is invasive and painful. Recently ultrasound elastography has been used to measure soft tissue elasticity based on shear wave propagation speed. Because the muscle's elasticity is affected by the pressure within the compartment, ultrasound elastography might be a possible tool for the compartment pressure evaluation. Ultrasound shear wave elastography and pressure were simultaneously measured using a clinical ultrasound system and clinically used catheter in a turkey anterior-lateral and anterior-deep compartment under elevated pressures of baseline, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mmHg using vascular infusion technique. Shear wave propagation speed increased linearly in proportion to the increase in intra-compartmental pressure. Strong correlation was observed between measured pressure and mean shear wave speed in each compartment (anterior-lateral compartment, mean R2 = 0.929, P < 0.001; anterior-deep compartment, mean R2 = 0.97, P < 0.001).

This has been interpreted by some to indicate the existence of active control in which the nervous system uses the CoM state at or near mid-stance to regulate subsequent foot placement. However, the passive dynamics of the moving body and/or moving limbs also contribute (perhaps strongly) to foot placement, and thus to its variation. The extent to which correlations of CoM state to foot placement reflect the effects of within-step active control, those of passive dynamics, or some combination of both, remains an important and still open question. Here, we used an open-loop-stable 2D walking model to show that this predictive ability cannot by itself be taken as evidence of within-step active control. In our simulations, we too find high correlations between the CoM state and subsequent foot placement, but these correlations are entirely due to passive dynamics as our system has no active control, either within a step or between steps. This demonstrates that any inferences made from such correlations about within-step active control require additional supporting evidence beyond the correlations themselves. Thus, these within-step predictive correlations leave unresolved the relative importance of within-step active control as compared to passive dynamics, meaning that such methods should be used to characterize control in human walking only with caution.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Antagonist muscles, which contribute negatively to a net joint moment, are known to be important for maintaining glenohumeral joint stability. This study aimed to compare muscle and joint force predictions from a subject-specific neuromusculoskeletal model of the shoulder driven entirely by measured muscle electromyography (EMG) data with those from a musculoskeletal model employing static optimization. Four healthy adults performed six sub-maximal upper-limb contractions including shoulder abduction, adduction, flexion, extension, internal rotation and external rotation. EMG data were simultaneously measured from 16 shoulder muscles using surface and intramuscular electrodes, and joint motion evaluated using video motion analysis. Muscle and joint forces were calculated using both a calibrated EMG-driven neuromusculoskeletal modeling framework, and musculoskeletal model simulations that employed static optimization. The EMG-driven model predicted antagonistic muscle function for pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major during abduction and flexion; supraspinatus during adduction; middle deltoid during extension; and subscapularis, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi during external rotation. In contrast, static optimization neural solutions showed little or no recruitment of these muscles, and preferentially activated agonistic prime movers with large moment arms. As a consequence, glenohumeral joint force calculations varied substantially between models. The findings suggest that static optimization may under-estimate the activity of muscle antagonists, and therefore, their contribution to glenohumeral joint stability.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Quantification of centre of pressure (COP) movement is the most common focus of instrumented assessment. Frequency-domain COP analyses have focused primarily on summary measures or pre-defined frequency bands but continuous analysis may provide novel and complementary insight into pathological control mechanisms. Our aims were (i) to compare post-SRC COP trajectory changes identified using clinician scores (Modified Balance Error Scoring System (M-BESS)), time-domain COP variables and continuous frequency spectral comparison; and (ii) to characterise frequency spectra changes. Male rugby players aged 15-19 years (n = 135) completed a pre-season baseline assessment comprising vision-obscured double-leg, single-leg and tandem stances on a force platform. Participants diagnosed with SRC during the season (n = 15) underwent repeat testing (median 4 days post-SRC; IQR 2.5-6.5). Baseline and post-SRC COP trajectories were compared using common time-domain COP variables, M-BESS scores and continuous frequency spectra. Post-SRC changes were identified using all three approaches. Spectral analysis revealed the largest effect size (Cliff's delta 0.39) and was the only method to identify differences in all three stances and in double-leg stance. All post-SRC increases in spectral content were in the anteroposterior direction; all decreases were in the mediolateral direction. Changes were localised to higher frequencies (1.7-8 Hz) except for double-leg stance anteroposterior direction, for which increases were observed throughout the analysed range. Our findings suggest that this method of spectral comparison may provide a more responsive and meaningful measure of postural stability changes after SRC than other commonly-used variables.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

We aimed to examine the effects of task dynamics on the coordination of hand muscles, and on the motor adaptation to external assistance. Twenty-four healthy subjects performed one of the two types of a finger extension task, isometric dorsal fingertip force production (static) or isokinetic finger extension (dynamic). Subjects performed the tasks voluntarily without assistance, or with a biomimetic exotendon providing targeted assistance to their extrinsic muscles. In unassisted conditions, significant between-task differences were found in the coordination of the extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles, while the extrinsic muscle activities were similar between the tasks. Under assistance, while the muscle coordination remained relatively unaffected during the dynamic task, significant changes in the coordination between the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles were observed during the static task. Intermuscular coherence values generally decreased during the static task under assistance, but increased during the dynamic task (all p-values < 0.01). Additionally, a significant change in the task dynamics was induced by assistance only during static task. Our study showed that task type significantly affect coordination between the extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscles. During the static task, a lack of sensory information from musculotendons and joint receptors (more sensitive to changes in length/force) is postulated to have resulted in a neural decoupling between muscles and a consequent isolated modulation of the intrinsic muscle activity.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study evaluated the Mbientlab MetaMotionR IMUs, relative to Vicon motion capture equipment in measuring local dynamic stability of the spine (quantified using maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponent; λmax), lumbopelvic coordination (quantified using mean absolute relative phase; MARP), and intersegmental motor variability (quantified using deviation phase; DP) of lumbopelvic segments in 10 participants during 35 cycles of repetitive spine flexion-extension (FE). Intraclass correlations were strong between systems when using both the FE angle time-series and the sum of squares (SS) time-series to measure local dynamic stability (0.807 ≤ICC2,1λmax,FE ≤ 0.919; 0.738 ≤ ICC2,1λmax,SS ≤ 0.868), sagittal-plane lumbopelvic coordination (0.961 ≤ICC2,1MARP ≤ 0.963), and sagittal-plane lumbopelvic variability (0.961 ≤ICC2,1DP ≤ 0.963).

Here, we expand on prior work by comparing biomechanical and functional outcomes in two prosthetic feet with the largest differences in mechanical response to added load (i.e., consistently ""Compliant"" and ""Stiff"" forefoot properties). In each foot, fourteen male Servicemembers with unilateral transtibial limb loss (from trauma) completed instrumented gait analyses in all combinations of two loading conditions (with and without 22 kg weighted vest) and two walking speeds (1.34 and 1.52 m/s), as well as the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire. With the Stiff foot, sound limb peak loading was 2% smaller (p = 0.043) in the loaded versus unloaded condition, but similar between loading conditions in the Compliant foot (note, the Stiff foot was associated with larger loads, overall). Independent of load or walking speed, the Compliant (versus Stiff) foot provided 67.9% larger (p < 0.001) prosthetic push-off, 17.7% larger (p = 0.01) roll-over shape radii, and was subjectively favored by 10 participants. A more Compliant versus Stiff prosthetic foot therefore appears to better accommodate walking with and without added load, and reinforce the notion that mechanical properties of prosthetic feet should be considered for near-term performance and longer-term (joint) health.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Ten cryopreserved cadaveric arms were dissected and the insertional tendons and capsuloligamentous tissues were preserved. The specimens were placed in a custom-made device. Elbow position was established at 90° flexion with the forearm in a neutral position and the wrist extended at 0°. Tekscan sensors sere used for measuring intraarticular pressures. Without loading the elbow, the humeroradial joint received the lowest pressure, and, among the humeroulnar joints, the highest pressure was found in the anterolateral compartment. After loading the epitrochlear muscles to the maximum (5.0 kg), the pressure increased in the anteromedial joint (0.6 kg to 3.3 kg) and decreased in the posteromedial and anterolateral joints (4.2 kg to 0.3 kg and 4.2 kg to 0.9 kg, respectively). After the same loading in the epicondylar muscles, the pressure increased in the anterolateral and humeroradial joints (4.2 kg to 8.2 kg and 0.2 kg to 1.0 kg respectively), but decreased in the posterolateral joint (3.4 kg to 1.0 kg).

Sagittal sonographs of MG, LG, SOL were taken at ankle was positioned at 15° (dorsiflexion), 0° (neutral position), +15°, and +30° (plantarflexion), with the knee at 90° at rest and after a long-duration spaceflight. At each position, longitudinal ultrasonic images of the MG and LG and SOL were obtained while the cosmonauts was relaxed from which fascicle lengths and angles with respect to the aponeuroses were determined. After space flight plantarflexor force declined significantly (26%; p < 0.001). The internal architecture of the GM, and LG, and SOL muscle was significantly altered. In the passive condition, Lf changed from 45, 53, and 39 mm (knee, 0°, ankle, -15°) to 26, 33, and 28 mm (knee, 90° ankle, 30°) for MG, LG, and SOL, respectively. Different lengths and angles of fascicles, and their changes by contraction, might be related to differences in force-producing capabilities of the muscles and elastic characteristics of tendons and aponeuroses. The three heads of the triceps surae muscle substantially differ in architecture, which probably reflects their functional roles.

That makes them important components of the human body and wearable assistive devices alike. This study investigates how springs placed anteriorly across the hip joint affect leg joint angles and powers, and leg muscle activities during level walking at 0.5 to 2.1 m/s. We hypothesized that the anterior hip springs (I) load hip extension, (II) support hip flexion and (III) affect ankle muscle activity and dynamics during walking. Effects at the ankle were expected because hip and ankle redistribute segmental power in concert to achieve forward progression. We observed that the participants' contribution to hip power did not increase during hip extension as the spring stored energy. Simultaneously, the activities of plantarflexor muscles that modulate energy storage in the Achilles tendon were reduced by 28% (gastrocnemius medialis) and 9% (soleus). As the spring returned energy with the onset of hip flexion, the participants' contribution to hip power was reduced by as much as 23%. Soleus activity before push-off increased by up to 9%. Instead of loading hip extension, anterior hip springs seem to store and return parts of the energy normally exchanged with the Achilles tendon. Thereby, the springs support hip flexion but may reduce elastic energy storage in and hence recoil from the Achilles tendon. This interaction should be considered during the design and simulation of wearable assistive devices as it might - depending on user characteristics - enhance or diminish their overall functionality.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

While the subaxial cervical spine has been extensively studied, the motion characteristics of the occipito-atlantal (C0-1) and atlanto-axial (C1-2) cervical segments were less reported due to technical difficulties in accurate imaging of these two segments. In this study, we investigated the intervertebral ROMs of the entire cervical spine (C0-T1) during in vivo functional neck motions of asymptomatic human subjects, including maximal flexion-extension, left-right lateral bending, and left-right axial torsion, using previously validated dual fluoroscopic imaging and model registration techniques. During all neck motions, C0-1, similar to C7-T1, was substantially less mobile than other segments and always contributed less than 10% of the cervical rotations. During the axial rotation of the neck, C1-2 contributed 73.2 ± 17.3% of the cervical rotation, but each of other segments contributed less than 10% of the cervical rotation. During both lateral bending and axial torsion neck motions, regardless of primary or coupled motions, the axial torsion ROM of C1-2 was significantly greater than its lateral bending ROM (p < 0.001), whereas the opposite differences were consistently observed at subaxial segments. This study reveals that there are distinct motion patterns at upper and lower cervical segments during in vivo neck motions.

However, does this efficient obstacle avoidance strategy exist when stepping over multiple obstacles? The study attempted to answer this question. Nineteen healthy young adults (25.84 ± 3.35 years) were recruited and performed multiple obstacle crossings when intervals between two obstacles were one-step, two-step, and three-step away, respectively. The dependent variables were foot integrated pressure (FIP) and other kinematic parameters - horizontal distance (HD, a heel-contact-to-obstacle distance of the leading leg/toe-off-to-obstacle distance of the trailing leg) and vertical distance (VD, toe clearance of both legs). A significant interaction among the effect of different legs, different intervals, and different obstacles on FIP, and kinematic parameters of HD and VD was found (p < 0.0001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001). Also, when the obstacle intervals were two-step and three-step away, the FIPs of the leading leg were significantly greater when stepping over the second obstacle than when stepping over the first one (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). These significantly greater FIPs might be attributed to the shorter HD (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) of the trailing leg, and the longer HD (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) of the leading leg.

However, this knowledge is incomplete. The goal of this study was to expand this knowledge by investigating the stabilizing function of the ligaments using multiple morphologically subject-specific computational models. Nine models were created from the lower extremities of nine donors. Each model consisted of the articulating bones, articular cartilage, and ligaments. Simulations were conducted in ADAMS™ - a dynamic simulation program. During simulation, tibia and fibula were fixed while cyclic moments in all three anatomical planes were applied to the calcaneus one-at-a-time. The resulting displacements between the bones and the forces in each ligament were computed. Simulations were conducted with all ligaments intact and after simulated ligament serial sectioning. Each model was validated by comparing the simulation results to experimental data obtained from the specimen used to construct the model. From the results the stabilizing role of each ligament was established and the effect of ligament sectioning on Range of Motion and Overall Laxity was identified. On the lateral side, ATFL provided stabilization in supination, CFL restrained inversion, external rotation and dorsiflexion and PTFL limited dorsiflexion and external rotation. On the medial side, PTTL restrained dorsiflexion and internal rotation, ATTL limited plantarflexion and external rotation, and TCL limited dorsiflexion, eversion and external rotation. At the subtalar joint, ITCL limited plantarflexion and its posterior-lateral bundle restrained subtalar inversion. CL restrained plantarflexion/dorsiflexion, and internal and external rotation.

HS-feeding increased myofiber stress and strain along both the transmural and longitudinal directions at the end-diastolic state but resulted in a lower absolute value of strain and relatively unchanged stress at the end-systolic state. Moreover, the end-diastolic stress and strain decreased with increasing radial position from the endocardial towards the epicardial walls despite negligible changes along the longitudinal direction. The changes in LV wall mechanics characterized the elevated diastolic LV stiffness and slow LV relaxation in HS-fed rats of HFpEF.

To get beyond a qualitative analysis, this paper provides a foot placement classification and analysis method that can be used in sports, rehabilitation or ergonomics. The method is based on machine learning using a weighted k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The learning phase is performed by an observer who classifies a set of trials. The algorithm then automatically reproduces this classification on subsequent sets. The method also provides detailed analysis of foot placement strategy, such as estimating the average foot placements for each class or visualizing the variability of strategies. An example of applying the method to a manual material handling task demonstrates its usefulness. During the lifting phase, the foot placements were classified into four groups: front, contralateral foot behind, ipsilateral foot behind, and parallel.

We investigated the effects of ankle position during hamstring stretching on the decrease in passive stiffness. Fourteen healthy men performed static stretching for the hamstrings with the ankle dorsiflexed and plantar-flexed in a randomized order on different days. The hip was passively flexed to the maximum angle which could be tolerated without stretch pain with the knee fully extended; this was maintained for 5 min, with 1-min stretching performed in 5 sessions. Final angles and passive stiffness were measured before and after stretching. The final angle was defined as that formed by the tibia and horizontal plane when the knee was passively extended from hip and knee angles at 90° flexion to the maximum extension angle which could be tolerated without stretch pain. Passive stiffness was determined by the slope of torque-angle curve during the measurement of the final angle. The final angle significantly increased after stretching with the ankle dorsiflexed and plantar-flexed, whereas passive stiffness significantly decreased only after stretching with the ankle planter-flexed. The results suggest that passive stiffness decreases after stretching with the ankle planter-flexed but not after stretching with the ankle dorsiflexed, although the range of joint motion increases regardless of the ankle position during 5-min stretching for the hamstrings. These results indicate that static stretching should be performed with the ankle plantar-flexed when aiming to decrease passive stiffness of the hamstrings.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Characteristics of torsional motion has also been proposed to be markers for cardiac dysfunction. However, its effects on fluid and energy dynamics in the left ventricle have not been comprehensively investigated. To investigate this, we performed image-based flow simulations on five healthy adult porcine and two healthy human foetal left ventricles (representing two different length scales) at different degrees of torsional motions. In the adult porcine ventricles, cardiac features such as papillary muscles and mitral valves, and cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarctions, were also included to investigate the effect of twist. The results showed that, for all conditions investigated, ventricular torsional motion caused minimal changes to flow patterns, and consistently accounted for less than 2% of the energy losses, wall shear stresses, and ejection momentum energy. In contrast, physiological characteristics such as chamber size, stroke volume and heart rate had a much greater influence on flow patterns and energy dynamics. The results thus suggested that it might not be necessary to model the torsional motion to study the flow and energy dynamics in left ventricles.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the mechanical properties of pediatric brain tissue derived from humans and piglets are very scarce, and this seriously detracts from the biofidelity of the developed finite element (FE) models of the pediatric head/brain. The present study addresses this issue by subjecting the cerebrum (white matter and gray matter), cerebellum, and brainstem specimens derived from 8-week-old piglets to tension and shear testing at strain rates of 0.01, 1, and 50/s. The experimental data are combined with the corresponding data derived from a previous study under compression to obtain comprehensive stress-strain curves of the pediatric porcine cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem tissue specimens. In general, the average stress level of the white matter is somewhat higher than that of the gray matter under the tension, shear and compression conditions, however, this difference does not reach a significant level. The stiffness of the cerebellum and the cerebrum does not differ significantly under tension and shear conditions, but the stiffness of the cerebellum is greater than that of the cerebrum under compression. The brainstem has significantly higher stiffness than the cerebrum and the cerebellum under all loading modes. In addition, the mechanical properties of brain tissue exhibit significant strain-rate dependences. With increasing strain rate from 0.01/s to 50/s, the average stress at a strain of 0.5 for all of the brain tissue increased by about 2.2 times under tension, about 2.4 times under shearing and about 2.2 times under compression.

We investigated the influence of IMU position and orientation placement errors on GRF estimation accuracy.


METHODS
Kinematic data from twelve healthy subjects based on marker trajectories were used to simulate 1848 combinations of sensor position placement errors (range ± 100 mm) and orientation placement errors (range ± 25°) across eight body segments (trunk, pelvis, left/right thighs, left/right shanks, and left/right feet) during normal walking trials for baseline cases when a single sensor was misplaced and for the extreme cases when all sensors were simultaneously misplaced. Three machine learning algorithms were used to estimate GRF for each placement error condition and compared with the no placement error condition to evaluate performance.


RESULTS
Position placement errors for a single misplaced IMU reduced vertical GRF (VGRF), medio-lateral GRF (MLGRF), and anterior-posterior GRF (APGRF) estimation accuracy by up to 1.1%, 2.0%, and 0.9%, respectively and for all eight simultaneously misplaced IMUs by up to 4.9%, 6.0%, and 4.3%, respectively. Orientation placement errors for a single misplaced IMU reduced VGRF, MLGRF, and APGRF estimation accuracy by up to 4.8%, 7.3%, and 1.5%, respectively and for all eight simultaneously misplaced IMUs by up to 20.8%, 23.4%, and 12.3%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
IMU sensor misplacement, particularly orientation placement errors, can significantly reduce GRF estimation accuracy and thus measures should be taken to account for placement errors in implementations of GRF estimation via wearable IMUs.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We propose that the increased loading that developing postnatal tendons experience with the onset of locomotor behavior impacts tendon formation. The objective of this study was to assess the onset of spontaneous weight-bearing locomotion in postnatal day (P) 1, 5, and 10 rats, and characterize the relationship between locomotion and the mechanical development of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing tendons. Movement was video recorded and scored to determine non-weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing, and full weight-bearing locomotor behavior at P1, P5, and P10. Achilles tendons, as weight-bearing tendons, and tail tendons, as non-weight-bearing tendons, were mechanically evaluated. We observed a significant increase in locomotor behavior in P10 rats, compared to P1 and P5. We also found corresponding significant differences in the maximum force, stiffness, displacement at maximum force, and cross-sectional area in Achilles tendons, as a function of postnatal age. However, the maximum stress, strain at maximum stress, and elastic modulus remained constant. Tail tendons of P10 rats had significantly higher maximum force, maximum stress, elastic modulus, and stiffness compared to P5. Our results suggest that the onset of locomotor behavior may be providing the mechanical cues regulating postnatal tendon growth, and their mechanical development may proceed differently in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing tendons. Further analysis of how this loading affects developing tendons in vivo may inform future engineering approaches aiming to apply such mechanical cues to regulate engineered tendon formation in vitro.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We have previously investigated the role of wall shear stress (WSS) and WSS gradients (WSSG) in search for a mechanistic link to formation of sidewall aneurysms using an automated and objective tool for aneurysm removal and arterial reconstruction in combination with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, we warned against the use of the tool for bifurcation type aneurysms because of a potential unrealistic reconstruction of the apex. We hypothesized that inclusion of additional morphological features from the surrounding vasculature could overcome these constraints. We extended the previously published method for removal and reconstruction of the bifurcation vasculature based on diverging and converging points of the parent and daughter artery centerlines, to also include two new centerlines between the daughter vessels, one of them passed through the bifurcation center. Validation was performed by comparing the efficacy of the two algorithms, using ten healthy models of the internal carotid artery terminus as ground truth. Qualitative results showed that the bifurcation apexes became smoother relative to the original algorithm; more consistent with the reference models. This was reflected quantitatively by a reduced maximum distance between the reference and reconstructed surfaces, although not statistically significant. Furthermore, the modified algorithm also quantitatively improved CFD derived WSS and WSSG, especially the latter. In conclusion, the modified algorithm does not perfectly reconstruct the bifurcation apex, but provides an incremental improvement, especially important for the derived hemodynamic metrics of interest in vascular pathobiology.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the pericellular matrix (PCM) progressively degrade in osteoarthritis, changing the overall mechanical properties of the cartilage. We investigated the mechanical properties particularly elasticity of the ECM and PCM and their interconnection as a function of chondrocyte spatial organisation. Human articular cartilage samples from 30 patients were categorised according to their cellular pattern. Elasticity of the ECM and PCM was assessed by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Significant decreases were observed in the elasticity of both the ECM and the PCM with each change of cellular pattern, except from single to double strings in the ECM (p = 0.072). Spatial reorganisation strongly correlated with the elasticity of the ECM (r = -0.768, p < 0.001) and of the PCM (r = -0.729, p < 0.001). The ECM/PCM ratio remained unchanged (r = -0.099, p = 0.281).

Finite Element (FE) models of new lattice liners with prismatic and tetrahedral topologies were developed. A typical frontal head impact in motorcycle accidents was simulated, and linear and rotational accelerations of the head were recorded. A high-fidelity FE model of TBI was loaded with the accelerations to predict the brain response during the accident. The results show that prismatic lattices have better performance in preventing TBI than tetrahedral lattices and EPS that is typically used in helmets. Moreover, varying the cell size through the thickness of the liner improves its performance, but this effect was marginal. The relative density also has a significant effect, with lattices with lower relative densities providing better protection. Across different lattices studied here, the prismatic lattice with a relative density of 6% had the best performance and reduced the peak linear and rotational accelerations, Head Injury Criterion (HIC), brain strain and strain rate by 48%, 37%, 49%, 32% and 65% respectively, compared to the EPS liner. These results can be used to guide the design of lattice helmet liners for better mitigation of TBI.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Three groups were compared (symptomatic with mild radiographic hip OA, n = 12; asymptomatic with mild radiographic hip OA, n = 13; OA-free controls, n = 20). Measures of the external moment (peak and impulse) in the sagittal, frontal and transverse plane during walking were determined. Variables were compared according to group allocation using mixed linear regression models that included individual gait trials, with group allocation as fixed effect and walking speed as a random effect. Participants with evidence of radiographic disease irrespective of symptoms walked 14-16% slower compared to disease-free controls (p = 0.002). Radiographic disease without symptoms was not associated with any altered measures of hip joint moment compared to asymptomatic OA-free controls once speed was taken into account (p ≥ 0.099). People with both mild radiographic disease and symptoms had lower external peak hip adduction moment (p = 0.005) and lower external peak internal rotation moment (p < 0.001) accounting for walking speed. Among angular impulses, only the presence of symptoms was associated with a reduced hip internal rotation impulse (p = 0.002) in the symptomatic group. Collectively, our observations suggest that symptoms have additional mechanical associations from radiographic disease alone, and provide insight into potential early markers of hip OA. Future research is required to understand the implications of modifying walking speed and/or the external hip adduction and internal rotation moment in people with mild hip OA.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Previous work has predicted body segment parameters (BSPs) in the general population using age and obesity levels as statistical predictors (Merrill et al., 2017). Estimated errors in the prediction of BSPs can be as large as 40%, depending on age, and the prediction method employed (Durkin and Dowling, 2003). Thus, more accurate and representative segment parameter inputs are required for attempting to predict modeling outputs such as joint contact forces, muscle forces, and injury risk in individuals. This study aims to provide statistical models for predicting torso, thigh, shank, upper arm, and forearm segment parameters in working adults using whole body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan data along with a set of anthropometric measurements. The statistical models were developed on a training data set, and independently validated on a separate test data set. The predicted BSPs in validation data were, on average, within 5% of the actual in vivo DXA-based BSPs, while previously developed predictions (de Leva, 1996) had average errors of up to 60%, indicating that the new models greatly increase the accuracy in predicting segment parameters.

Twenty-two young adults attended 2 visits. In each visit participants walked forwards at preferred walking speed (PWS) for 3-minutes (pre) followed by 5-minutes walking each at 80%, 100% and 120% of PWS of either forward or backward walking then a further 3-minutes walking forward at PWS (post). The order of walking speed in each visit was randomised and walking direction of each visit was randomised. An inertial measurement unit was placed over L5 vertebra to record tri-axial accelerations. From the trunk accelerations multiscale entropy, harmonic ratio and stride time variability were calculated to measure complexity, symmetry and variability for each walk. Complexity increased with increasing walking speed for all axes in forward and backward walking, and backward walking was less complex than forward walking. Stride time variability was also greater in backward than forward walking. Anterio-posterior and medio-lateral complexity increased following forward and backward walking but there was no difference between forward and backward walking post effects. No effects were found for harmonic ratio. These results suggest during backward walking trunk motion is rigidly controlled but central pattern generators responsible for temporal gait patterns are less refined for backward walking. However, in both directions complexity increased as speed increased suggesting additional constraint of trunk motion, normally characterised by reduced complexity, is not applied as speed increases.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and RFD were assessed <1 month post-stroke during isometric knee extension (sitting position; 90° knee flexion) using a hand-held dynamometer. RFD was measured as the average slope of the torque-time curve over time intervals of 0-50 ms and 0-200 ms from contraction onset. In the patient group, MVC and RFD for 0-50 ms were significantly lower on the affected side than on the unaffected side (p < 0.01).

No significant differences in MVC between patient and control groups were observed for either side. RFD of the knee extensors significantly decreased without MVC reduction in patients with acute stroke history compared with that in age-matched healthy adults in both the affected and unaffected sides.

However, the difference in the peak EKFT between individuals with knee OA and age-matched subjects was unclear. Therefore, to understand the kinematics, kinetics, and electromyogram characteristics in individuals with knee OA, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of sagittal plane-dominant sit-to-stand (STS) motion.

Meta-analysis showed that individuals with knee OA present significantly lower peak EKFT (pooled SMD: -1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.36 to -0.88), significantly large trunk flexion angle (pooled SMD: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.39), and no significantly lower peak external knee adduction torque despite the significantly larger lateral-lean angle to the less affected side (pooled SMD: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.39). The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low. The descriptive synthesis indicates that STS motion in individuals with knee OA might be an unsuitable motion strategy for knee muscle activity, force utilization from multiple joints to the knee joint, and their influence on knee joint cartilage, despite their lower peak EKFT.

These cells typically respond to physiological compression with pathways consistent with matrix synthesis, and chondrocyte mechanotransduction is essential for homeostasis. In osteoarthritis (OA), chondrocyte mechanotransduction appears to be dysregulated, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The objective of this study is to document the phosphoproteomic responses of primary osteoarthritic chondrocytes to physiological sinusoidal compression. We show that OA chondrocytes respond to physiological compression by first activating proteins consistent with cytoskeletal remodeling and decreased transcription, and then later activating proteins for transcription. These results show that several microtubule-related proteins respond to compression. Our results demonstrate that compression is a relevant physiological stimulus for osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Future analyses may build on these results to find differences in compression-induced phosphoproteins between normal and OA cells that lead to druggable targets to restore homeostasis to diseased joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Since mechanical loading is an important determinant of the disease process, a possible conservative treatment is the unloading of joints. In principle, a neuromuscular rehabilitation program aimed to promote alternative muscle recruitments could reduce the loads on the lower-limb joints during walking. The extent of joint load reduction one could expect from this approach remains unknown. Furthermore, assuming significant reductions of the load on the affected joint can be achieved, it is unclear whether, and to what extent, the other joints will be overloaded. Using subject-specific musculoskeletal models of four different participants, we computed the muscle recruitment strategies that minimised the hip, knee and ankle contact force, and predicted the contact forces such strategies induced at the other joints. Significant reductions of the peak force and impulse at the knee and hip were obtained, while only a minimal effect was found at the ankle joint. Adversely, the peak force and the impulse in non-targeted joints increased when aiming to minimize the load in an adjacent joint. These results confirm the potential of alternative muscle recruitment strategies to reduce the loading at the knee and the hip, but not at the ankle. Therefore, neuromuscular rehabilitation can be targeted to reduce the loading at affected joints but must be considered carefully in patients with multiple joints affected due to the potential adverse effects in non-targeted joints.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this paper, we focus solely on understanding acoustoelasticity in soft hydrated tissues using SWE data and propose a straightforward approach to modeling the constitutive behavior of soft tissue that has a direct microstructural/macromolecular interpretation. Our approach incorporates two constitutive features relevant to biological tissues into AE-SWE: static dilation of the medium associated with nonstructural components (e.g. tissue hydration and perfusion) and finite extensibility derived from an ideal network of biological filaments. We evaluated the proposed method using data from an in-house tissue-mimicking phantom experiment, and ex vivo and in vivo AE-SWE data available in the SWE literature.

Therefore, the present study has been performed to investigate how the differentiation of post-harvest, native bone marrow-derived cells is regulated by cyclic stretch in vitro. Bone marrow-derived cells were obtained from mouse femur of both hind limbs and categorized into the following five categories: amebocytes, round cells, spindle cells, stellate cells and others. The cells were seeded on a silicone-made stretch chamber, and subjected to cyclic stretch with an amplitude of 10% at a frequency of 1 Hz for 7 days for cell shape analysis and for 3 days for the analysis of the expression of marker proteins of osteogenic (osteocalcin), vascular smooth muscle (α-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain) and neurogenic (neurofilament) differentiation. When disregarding the differences in the cell shapes, there was an overall trend that the application of 10% cyclic stretch inhibited osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation, but enhanced smooth muscle differentiation. Close examinations revealed that round cells were influenced the most by cyclic stretch (significant up- or down-regulation in all the four marker protein expressions) while amebocytes and spindle cells were only influenced by cyclic stretch for vascular smooth muscle and/or neurogenic differentiation.

Thus, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model to predict fall-risk following an unexpected over-ground slip perturbation based on normal gait pattern in healthy older adults. 112 healthy older adults who experienced a novel slip in a safe laboratory environment were included. Their slip trial and natural walking trial immediately prior to it were analyzed. To identify the best fall-risk predictive model, gait related variables including step length, segment angles, center of mass state, and ground reaction force (GRF) were determined and inputted into a stepwise logistic regression. The optimal slip-induced fall prediction model was based on the right thigh angle at slipping foot touchdown (TD), the maximum GRF of the slipping limb after TD, and the momentum change from TD to recovery foot liftoff (LO), with an overall prediction accuracy of 75.9%, predicting 74.5% of falls (sensitivity) and 77.2% of recoveries (specificity). Conversely, a model based on clinical and demographic measures predicted 78.2% of falls and 47.4% of recoveries, resulting in a much lower overall accuracy of 62.5%. The fall-risk model based on normal gait pattern which was developed for slip-induced perturbations in healthy older adults was able to provide a high predictive accuracy.

The established association between LBP and spine motor control has led to the development of many control assessment techniques. To understand spine control and LBP, it is essential to know the relationship between assessment techniques. Systems identification (SI) and local dynamic stability (LDS) are two methods of quantifying spine control. SI provides a detailed description of control but uses linearity assumptions, whereas LDS provides a ""black box"" non-linear assessment during dynamic movements. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to compare control outcomes of SI and LDS. 15 participants completed two tasks (SI and LDS) in a random order. For the SI task, participants were seated and ventrally perturbed at the 10th thoracic vertebrae. They were instructed to resist the perturbations (resist condition) or to relax the trunk (relax condition). Admittance was computed, and a neuromuscular control model quantified lumbar stiffness, damping and muscle spindle feedback gains. For the LDS task, participants completed three repetitive movement blocks consisting of flexion/extension, axial rotation, and complex movements. In each block, the maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponent (λmax) was estimated. A stepwise linear regression determined that λmax during the rotation task was best predicted by SI outcomes in the relax condition (adjusted R2 = 0.83). Many conditions demonstrated no relationship between λmax and SI outcomes. These findings outline the importance of a consistent framework for the assessment of spine control.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of arm motion on standing lateral jump performance and to examine the biomechanical mechanisms that may explain differences in jump distance. Six participants executed a series of jumps for maximum lateral distance from two in-ground force platforms for two jump cases (free and restricted arms) while an eight-camera, passive-reflector, motion capture system collected 3D position data throughout the movements. Inverse kinematics and dynamics analyses were performed for all jumps using three-dimensional (3D) link models to calculate segment angular velocities, joint moments, joint powers, and joint work. Free arm motion improved standing lateral jump performance by 29% on average. This improvement was due to increased takeoff velocity and improved lateral and vertical positions of the center of gravity (CG) at takeoff and touchdown. Improved velocity and position of the CG at takeoff resulted from a 33% increase in the work done by the body. This increase in work in free arm jumps compared to restricted arm jumps was found in both upper and lower body joints with the largest improvements (>30 J) occurring at the lower back, right hip, and right shoulder.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Current 3D-optoelectronic motion-capture systems capable of measuring these movements are inappropriate for use in clinical practice because they are stationary, expensive and time-consuming. We therefore developed a less complex 3D-tracking technology based on Steam®VR to measure six degrees of freedom in a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of this system. The developed prototype consists of two infrared-emitting lighthouses and sensors, mounted on the participant's helmet and trunk belt, to detect the orientation of the head and trunk. The system was evaluated by means of an infrared light-reflecting marker tracking system. Twenty healthy participants, equipped with these sensors and markers, performed thirteen neck movement tasks. Linear and angular movements were measured. These tasks were repeated after six to eight days to assess test-retest reliability. Concurrent validity was assessed by the root mean square error, and reliability with generalizability theory. With an average root mean square error between 1.2 and 2.0° in angular and 0.4-0.5 cm in linear movements, the prototype was shown to precisely track these movements. Reliability of the prototype and the reference system was comparable for all tasks. A high contribution of participant's variability to the observed variance was generally detected, with the exception of joint repositioning error and upper cervical flexion. The reliability was task-specific and did not differ between the systems. The prototype system was shown to be valid, although the reliability of the repositioning and upper cervical flexion tests needs to be reconsidered.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Up to recently, the complexity of measuring the human biodynamic response to vibration exposure implied to focus most of the research on the axial acceleration at the tibia. Using wireless three-dimensional accelerometers, this paper investigates the propagation of shock-induced vibrations through the whole lower-limb during running in the temporal and the spectral domains. Results indicated that the vibrations were not consistent across the lower-limb, showing various spatial and spectral distributions of energy. The amount of energy was not constantly decreasing from the distal to the proximal extremity of the runner's lower-limb, especially regarding the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Vibrations in the transversal plane of the segments were substantial compared to the longitudinal axis regarding the distal extremity of the tibia, and the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Further, the spectral content was wider at the distal than at the proximal end of the lower-limb. Finally, to get a thorough understanding of the risks incurred by the runners, the need to account for shock-induced vibrations up to 50 Hz has been stressed when investigating three-dimensional vibrations. The overall study raises attention on the substantial importance of the transverse components of the acceleration, and their potential relation to shear fatigue and injury during running.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

In many sport activities, such as a catcher in a baseball or a softball game, athletes have to make repetitive deep squatting motions, which have been associated with the development of osteochondritis dissecans. Excessive deep knee flexion postures may cause excessive loading in the knee joint. In deep knee flexion postures, the posterior aspect of the shank will contact the posterior thigh, resulting in a compressive force within the soft tissues. The current study was aimed at analyzing the effects of the posterior thigh/shank contact on the joint loading during deep knee flexion in a natural knee. An existing, whole body model with detailed anatomical components of the knee (AnyBody) has been adopted and modified for this study. The effects of the posterior thigh/shank contact were evaluated by comparing the results of the inverse dynamic analysis for two scenarios: with and without the posterior thigh/shank contact force. Our results showed that, in a deep squatting posture (knee flexion 120+ degrees), the posterior thigh/shank contact helps reduce the patellofemoral (PF) and tibiofemoral (TF) normal contact forces by 42% and 57%, respectively.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Biomechanical studies commonly model the foot as a single-segment, which can provide different ankle kinematics compared to a multi-segmented model. Also, it can neglect intersegmental kinematics of the foot-ankle joints, such as the hindfoot-tibia, forefoot-hindfoot, and hallux-forefoot joints, that are used during jump-landing activities. The purpose of this short communication was to compare ankle kinematics between a three- and single-segmented foot models, during forward and lateral single-leg jump-landings. Marker trajectories and synchronized ground reaction forces of 30 participants were collected using motion capture and a force plate, during multidirectional single-leg jump-landings. Ankle kinematics were computed using a three- (hindfoot-tibia) and a single-segmented (ankle) foot models, at initial contact (IC), peak vertical ground reaction force (PvGRF) and peak knee flexion (PKF). Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted (p < 0.05). The findings of this study showed that during lateral and forward jump-landing directions, the three-segmented foot model exhibited lower hindfoot-tibia dorsiflexion angles (PvGRF and PKF, p < 0.001) and excursions (sagittal: p < 0.001; frontal: p < 0.05) during the weightbearing acceptance phase than the single-segmented model. Overall, the two foot models provided distinctive sagittal ankle kinematics, with lower magnitudes in the hindfoot-tibia of the three-segmented foot. Furthermore, the three-segmented foot model may provide additional and representative kinematic data of the ankle and foot joints, to better comprehend its function, particularly in populations whose foot-ankle complex plays an important role (e.g., dancers).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Free-throw basketball shooting is very important. However, fatigue deteriorates postural balance which might decrease free-throw shooting performance. This study investigated the effects of foot orthoses on dynamic balance and accuracy performance during free-throw shooting before and after physical fatigue was induced. Thirteen male recreational basketball players were tested with two foot orthoses (medial-arch support versus flat control) and fatigue conditions (before and after fatigue), when they performed standard free-throw shooting on a force platform. Results revealed that fatigue significantly increased coefficient of variance of medial-lateral center of pressure (CoP) excursion when participants worn flat control orthoses (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, foot orthoses improved dynamic balance during shooting as they significantly reduced total resultant and anterior-posterior sway excursions as well as resultant and anterior-posterior CoP velocities, and base of support area. Although this study found that fatigue and orthoses did not significantly affect the scores gained by free-throw shooting, the significant improvements in dynamic balance during shooting with the use of foot orthoses could have considerable impact on motor control during basketball shooting.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

The structure and mechanical properties of nacre have been intensively investigated with a special focus on its toughening strategies; nevertheless, the fracture mechanisms, more specifically the critical stress/strain conditions for the failure of nacre, and the effects of structural orientation and hydration state remain largely unexplored. Here uniaxial compression tests were performed on nacre of both dry and hydrated states with different off-axis angles, i.e., the inclination of loading axis with respect to the lamellar structure, ranging from 0° to 90°. The mechanical properties and fracture characteristics of nacre and their dependences on the structural orientation and hydration state were elucidated in terms of mechanics behind failure. Quantitative relationships were established between the mechanical properties and off-axis angle based on different failure criteria. The competition between the fracture modes of fragmentation and shearing was quantified by comparing their respective driving force and resistance on the interfacial plane.

The procedure to measure body posture via motion-analysis techniques as well as the subsequent calculations of lumbosacral moments and spine loads by, respectively, inverse-dynamic and musculoskeletal models are complex and time-consuming. We aim to develop easy-to-use yet accurate artificial neural networks (ANNs) that predict 3D whole-body posture (ANNposture), segmental orientations (ANNangle), and lumbosacral moments (ANNmoment) based on our measurements during load-handling activities. Fifteen individuals each performed 135 load-handling activities by reaching (0 kg) or handling (5 and 10 kg) weights located at nine different horizontal and five vertical (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 cm from the floor) locations. Whole-body posture was measured via a motion capture system and lumbosacral moments were calculated via a 3D top-down eight link-segment inverse-dynamic model. ANNposture, ANNangle, and ANNmoment were trained (RMSEs = 6.7 cm, 29.8°, and 16.2 Nm, respectively) and their generalization capability was tested (RMSE = 7.0 cm and R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 29.9° and R2 = 0.85, and RMSE = 16.5 Nm and R2 = 0.97, respectively).

Toward this end, porcine aortas were sectioned into eighteen rings, with one ring from each anatomical position radially cut to obtain the zero-stress state for the intact wall and the other ring dissected into intimal-medial and adventitial layers; these rings were then radially cut to reach the zero-stress state for the intima-media and adventitia. Peripheral variations in internal/external circumferences, thickness, and opening angle of the intact wall and its layers were measured through image analysis at the no-load and zero-stress states. Intact wall and layer circumferences at both states significantly declined along the aorta, as did intact wall and intimal-medial but not adventitial thickness. Adventitia exhibited the greatest opening angles, approaching 180 deg all over the aorta. The opening angles of the intima-media and intact wall were quite similar, with the highest values in the ascending aorta, the lowest at the diaphragm, and increasing subsequently. Bending-related residual stretches were released by radial cutting that were compressive internally and tensile externally, displaying distinct axial variation for the intima-media and intact wall, and non-significant variation for the adventitia.

Reciprocal changes after spinal surgery might be critical for the outcomes, but assessing their extent remains a challenge. This paper proposes a method for predicting full-body sagittal alignment including reciprocal changes in response to spinal fusion, based on musculoskeletal modeling and inverse-inverse dynamics approach. An established body model (AnyBody) was used, with fused segments modeled as rigid. Posture was optimized based on muscle expenditure minimization, following the concept of the cone of economy. The data of adult spinal fusion patients were obtained retrospectively from an ongoing clinical study. Patient spino-pelvic alignment, body weight and height, age- and pathology-related muscle deterioration, and underwent treatment details were represented in the model. Predicted postural changes were compared to follow-up radiographs to evaluate method validity. Twenty-one cases were analyzed in this preliminary study (age range = 48-74; number of fused segments 1-14). The model predictions correlated well with the radiographic measures at follow-up: TPA, r = 0.83; ΔPILL, r = 0.90; LL, r = 0.90; TK, r = 0.77. The model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting sagittal imbalance (positive predictive value = 1.00, negative predictive value = 0.75).

To this aim, we exploited computed tomography (CT), which can be used to create simulated radiographic projections with different orientations, for the creation of large training and validation datasets. In a set of 21 CT stacks, the location of 5 landmark points was manually determined for L2, L3 and L4, for a total of 63 vertebrae. For each vertebra, 200 simulated projections approximately aligned with sagittal plane but including random perturbations of the projection direction were built, resulting in 12,600 simulated radiographs with the corresponding local directions of the anatomical axes. These data were integrated by 1765 lateral images of vertebrae acquired with a biplanar radiographic imaging system, for which the orientation was calculated by means of three-dimensional reconstruction. The whole dataset was used to train a deep neural network, ResNet-101, customized for the estimation of the three-dimensional components of the axes. The accuracy of the network was qualitatively and quantitatively tested on a large group of simulated radiographic images as well as real lateral images acquired with a biplanar radiographic system for which the direction of the axes was known. Errors were lower than 3 degrees in 76% of the evaluations conducted on the simulated images, and in 86% for the real radiographs.

At the microscale, bone quality is related to porosity, microstructural organization, accumulated microdamage and intrinsic material properties. However, the link between these characteristics and fracture behavior is still missing. Bone tissue has a complex structure and as age-related compositional and structural changes occur at all hierarchical length scales it is difficult to experimentally identify and discriminate the effect of each mechanism. The aim of this study was therefore to use computational models to analyze how microscale characteristics in terms of porosity, intrinsic toughness properties and microstructural organization affect the mechanical behavior of cortical bone. Tensile tests were simulated using realistic microstructural geometries based on microscopy images of human cortical bone. Crack propagation was modelled using the extended finite element method where cement lines surrounding osteons were modelled with an interface damage law to capture crack deflections along osteon boundaries. Both increased porosity and impaired material integrity resulted in straighter crack paths with cracks penetrating osteons, similar to what is seen experimentally for old cortical bone. However, only the latter predicted a more brittle failure behavior. Furthermore, the local porosity influenced the crack path more than the macroscopic porosity. In conclusion, age-related changes in cortical bone affect the crack path and the mechanical response. However, increased porosity alone was not driving damage in old bone, but instead impaired tissue integrity was required to capture brittle failure in aging bone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This method requires a skeletal model, kinematics and measured ground reaction forces and moments (GRFM). Measuring GRFM is however only possible in a controlled environment. This paper introduces a probabilistic method based on probabilistic principal component analysis to estimate the joint torques for healthy gait without measured GRFM. A gait dataset of 23 subjects was obtained containing kinematics, measured GRFM and joint torques from inverse dynamics in order to obtain a probabilistic model. This model was then used to estimate the joint torques of other subjects without measured GRFM. Only kinematics, a skeletal model and timing of gait events are needed. Estimation only takes 0.28 ms per time instant. Using cross-validation, the resulting root mean square estimation errors for the lower-limb joint torques are found to be approximately 0.1 Nm/kg, which is 6-18% of the range of the ground truth joint torques. Estimated joint torque and GRFM errors are up to two times smaller than model-based state-of-the-art methods. Model-free artificial neural networks can achieve lower errors than our method, but are less repeatable, do not contain uncertainty information on the estimates and are difficult to use in situations which are not in the learning set. In contrast, our method performs well in a new situation where the walking speed is higher than in the learning dataset.

They have been extensively validated using instrumented implants. Conversely, a reduction approach considers only one flexor or extensor muscle group at the time to equilibrate the inter-segmental joint moment. It is not clear if such models can still predict reliable joint contact and musculo-tendon forces during gait. Tibiofemoral contact force and gastrocnemii, quadriceps, and hamstrings musculo-tendon forces were estimated using a reduction approach for five subjects walking with an instrumented prosthesis. The errors in the proximal-distal tibiofemoral contact force fell in the range (0.3-0.9 body weight) reported in the literature for musculoskeletal models using numerical optimisation. The musculo-tendon forces were in agreement with the EMG envelops and appeared comparable to the ones reported in the literature with generic musculoskeletal models. Although evident simplifications and limitations, it seems that the reduction approach can provided quite reliable results. It can be a useful pedagogical tool in biomechanics, e.g. to illustrate the theoretical differences between inter-segmental and contact forces, and can provide a first estimate of the joint loadings in subjects with limited musculoskeletal deformities and neurological disorders.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

To better understand the effects of reduced transverse plane stiffness in the shank of a prosthesis, a second-generation variable stiffness torsion adapter (VSTA II) was tested with individuals with a transtibial amputation (n = 10). Peak transverse plane moments, VSTA II deflection, range of whole body angular momentum (WBAM), ground reaction impulse, joint work, and personal stiffness preference were evaluated at three fixed stiffness levels (compliant: 0.25 Nm/°, intermediate: 0.75 Nm/°, stiff: 1.25 Nm/°) at three walking speeds (self-selected, fast and slow: +/- 20% of self-selected, respectively) while straight-line walking and performing left and right turns. Residual limb loading decreased and VSTA II displacement increased for reductions in stiffness and both metrics increased with increasing walking speed, while ground reaction impulse and joint work were unaffected. The range of WBAM increased with decreased stiffness, which suggests an increased risk of falling when using the VSTA II at lower stiffness settings. Preference testing showed no significant result, but trends for lower stiffness settings when turning and walking at self-selected speeds were noted, as were stiffer settings when walking straight and at faster speeds. These results show that a device with rotational compliance like the VSTA II could reduce loading on the residual limb during straight walking and turning activities and that factors such as walking speed, activity type and user preference can affect the conditions for optimal use.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

A different formulation of the balance of momentum, introduced here, permits the computation of hemodynamic forces from geometric and velocity data at the boundary of the blood volume, without the need of measuring the blood velocity inside.

However, the model upon which this concept was derived does not consider how the inertial characteristics of forced support-surface perturbations would influence balance control. Within the current article, the inverted pendulum model was restructured to account for fixed, piecewise accelerations of the BoS. From this logic, two variations of the adjusted margin of stability, each maintaining a similar definition of extrapolated CoM, are proposed; one ignoring horizontal ground contact and inertial forces applied to the BoS, the other incorporating these forces. Unique within the proposed models is the time-variant BoS boundaries that depend on the perturbation applied. Verification of the solution for each model is provided, along with a comparison of obtained values to previous methods of defining CoM position-velocity stability metrics using a computational model and optimal control. For the simpler model variation (ignoring forces), we also assessed how CoM position and perturbation parameter selection over/underestimate the predicted maximal permissible velocity. The results of these analyses suggest that factors which increase the acceleration impulse decrease the difference between the two models; the opposite was observed for factors increasing displacements between the CoM and BoS boundary. Lastly, use of the proposed adjusted margin of stability within an experimental data set highlights the ability of our model to predict instability (stepping strategies; negative margin of stability) relative to the use of the extrapolated CoM alone.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However, the challenge is to obtain a comprehensive analysis from low-quality data and sparse measurements. In this paper, we present a method to estimate gait kinematics and kinetics directly from raw inertial sensor data performing a single dynamic optimization. We formulated an optimal control problem to track accelerometer and gyroscope data with a planar musculoskeletal model. In addition, we minimized muscular effort to ensure a unique solution and to prevent the model from tracking noisy measurements too closely. For evaluation, we recorded data of ten subjects walking and running at six different speeds using seven inertial measurement units (IMUs). Results were compared to a conventional analysis using optical motion capture and a force plate. High correlations were achieved for gait kinematics (ρ⩾0.93) and kinetics (ρ⩾0.90). In contrast to existing IMU processing methods, a dynamically consistent simulation was obtained and we were able to estimate running kinetics. Besides kinematics and kinetics, further metrics such as muscle activations and metabolic cost can be directly obtained from simulated model movements. In summary, the method is insensitive to sensor noise and drift and provides a detailed analysis solely based on inertial sensor data.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Nevertheless, gradual osteolytic and/or osteosclerotic skeletal changes frequently indicate repetitive resections. Based on the fundamental adaptivity of bone to mechanical loads, the question arose whether resection-related anatomical alterations trigger relevant pathological skeletal adaptations. For a clinical case after mandibular box resection due to progressive osteoradionecrosis (ORN), routine biomechanical loading was simulated by finite element method, respecting pathology-related anatomy, tissue properties, and biting capacity. By 3D-visualization of the mandible's pathological development from follow-up-CT's over four years, remarkable correspondences of skeletal resorptions and increased unphysiological strain were revealed. Higher unphysiological load was correlated with more serious and earlier skeletal alterations. Three months post-operatively, serious buccal destruction at the distal resection corner occurred in correspondence with dominant tensile strain. At the resection, elevated strain caused by reduced alveolar height corresponded to skeletal compromise, observed 8-9 months post-operatively. ORN-related lesions, diagnosed before resection, entailed unphysiological strain coinciding with local skeletal alterations. Simulations with ""healthy"" instead of pathological tissue coefficients induced quantitative improvements of 25-33%, but without fundamental change. These results suggest a decisive contribution of resection-related biomechanical skeletal adaptations to this patient's mandibular decline with hemimandibulectomy about 2.5 years after the first resection. However, mechanical stress concentrations in sharp angles as the distal resection corner and reduced stability due to decreased alveolar height generally bear the danger of pathological biomechanics and severe skeletal adaptations for patients after mandibular box resection.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

There were non-significant differences in Vmax between each pair of technologies (linear encoder 2.11 ± 0.24 m·s-1, accelerometer 2.11 ± 0.26 m·s-1, force platform 2.12 ± 0.24 m·s-1) reporting a very low bias.

Building on evidence that such altered motions result in larger spinal loads during level-ground walking, here we characterize trunk-pelvic motions, trunk muscle forces, and resultant spinal loads among sixteen males with unilateral, transfemoral amputation (TFA) walking at a self-selected speed both up (""upslope""; 1.06 ± 0.14 m/s) and down (""downslope""; 0.98 ± 0.20 m/s) a 10-degree ramp. Tri-planar trunk and pelvic motions were obtained (and ranges-of-motion [ROM] computed) as inputs for a non-linear finite element model of the spine to estimate global and local muscle (i.e., trunk movers and stabilizers, respectively) forces, and resultant spinal loads. Sagittal- (p = 0.001), frontal- (p = 0.004), and transverse-plane (p < 0.001) trunk ROM, and peak mediolateral shear (p = 0.011) and local muscle forces (p = 0.010) were larger (respectively 45, 35, 98, 70, and 11%) in upslope vs. downslope walking. Peak anteroposterior shear (p = 0.33), compression (p = 0.28), and global muscle (p = 0.35) forces were similar between inclinations. Compared to previous reports of persons with TFA walking on level ground, 5-60% larger anteroposterior and mediolateral shear observed here (despite ∼0.25 m/s slower walking speeds) suggest greater mechanical demands on the low back in sloped walking, particularly upslope. Continued characterization of trunk motions and spinal loads during ADLs support the notion that repeated exposures to these larger-than-normal (i.e., vs. level-ground walking in TFA and uninjured cohorts) spinal loads contribute to an increased risk for low back injury following lower limb amputation.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Herein, hip angles calculated during dynamic activities were compared using coordinate systems described in the literature. In-vivo kinematic data of 24 participants (13 males) were analyzed during gait and the anterior impingement test using dual fluoroscopy and model-based tracking. Two coordinate systems for the pelvis (anterior pelvic plane, International Society of Biomechanics [ISB]) and three coordinate systems for the femur (table top plane with two definitions of the superior-inferior axis, ISB) were evaluated. Bony landmarks visible on computed tomography (CT) images were identified to establish each coordinate system and used as the basis to calculate differences in hip angles between coordinate system pairs. In the analysis during gait, the maximum differences derived from various coordinate system definitions were 6.7° ± 5.5° for flexion, 7.7° ± 2.1° for rotation, and 5.5° ± 0.7° for adduction. For the anterior impingement test, the differences were 8.1° ± 5.9°, 7.1° ± 1.2°, and 5.3° ± 0.7°, respectively. Landmark-based analysis using CT images could estimate these dynamic differences with errors less than 1.0°. Our results indicate that hip angles can be accurately transformed to angles calculated in different coordinate systems by accounting for the inherent bony anatomy.

In addition, these models lack lower extremities, which are required for comprehensive evaluations of functional activities or therapeutic exercises. We therefore created OpenSim-based musculoskeletal full-body models including a detailed thoracolumbar spine for children and adolescents aged 6-18 years and validated by comparing model predictions to in vivo data. After combining our recently developed adult thoracolumbar spine model with a lower extremity model, children and adolescent models were created for each year of age by adjusting segmental length and mass distribution, center of mass positions and moments of inertia of the major body segments as well as sagittal pelvis and spine alignment based on literature data. Similarly, muscle strength properties were adjusted based on CT-derived cross-sectional area measurements. Simulations were conducted from in vivo studies reported in the literature involving children and adolescents evaluating maximum trunk muscle strength (MTMS), lumbar disc compressibility (LDC), intradiscal pressure (IDP) and trunk muscle activity (MA). Model predictions correlated highly with in vivo data (MTMS: r ≥ 0.82, p ≤ 0.03; LDC: r = 0.77, p < 0.001; IDP: r ≥ 0.78, p < 0.001; MA: r ≥ 0.90, p < 0.001), indicating suitability for the reasonably accurate prediction of maximal trunk muscle strength, segmental loading and trunk muscle activity in children and adolescents.

Nine young healthy participants walked on a narrow beam. Three-dimensional motion capture was used to calculate the COM and XCOM relative to the base of support. Steps were classified as having either the COM or XCOM inside or outside the base of support, and were classified as successful (stable - foot placed on the beam) or failed (unstable - foot stepped off the beam). If the COM or XCOM are valid measures of stability, they should be within the base of support for successful steps and outside the base of support for failed steps. Classifying the COM and XCOM inside or outside the base of support correctly predicted successful or failed steps in 69% and 58% of cases, respectively. When the COM or XCOM were outside the base of support, walking faster seemed to help participants to maintain stability. The further the COM or XCOM were outside the base of support during a successful step, the more likely participants were to fail on a subsequent step. The results of this study suggest that both COM and XCOM are valid measures of stability during a beam walking task, but that classifying COM and XCOM as inside or outside the base of support may be over-simplistic.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Many techniques for measuring muscle activity detection exist in the literature. However, due to the complex nature of the EMG signal as well as the interference from other muscles that is observed during the measurement of the EMG signal, the accuracy of these techniques is compromised. In this paper, we introduce the neural muscle activation detection (NMAD) framework that detects the muscle activation based on deep learning. The main motivation behind using deep learning is to allow the neural network to detect based on the appropriate signal features instead of depending on certain assumptions. Not only the presented approach significantly improves the accuracy of timing detection, but because of the training nature, it can adapt to operate under different levels of interference and signal-to-noise ratio.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Thirty healthy young adults participated in this study. Each performed walking five times at a preferred speed and at a fast speed. The MoS was calculated over a gait cycle by defining the base of support (BoS) changes during a gait cycle. The MoS was divided into medial/lateral and anterior/posterior components (ML MoS and AP MoS). The central values and the values at 12 gait events of the MoS were compared. Positive/negative integration of ML MoS (ML MoSPOS and ML MoSNEG, respectively) and the average ML/AP MoS over a cycle (ML/AP MoSmean) were significantly lower at a fast gait than at a preferred gait. ML/AP MoS were lower at a fast speed than at the preferred speed, except for the ML MoS immediately before left heel strike (pre left HS) and right and left heel strike (HS). ML/AP MoS were significantly lower immediately before heel strike (pre-HS) than in other gait events, regardless of walking speed. It was suggested that pre-HS is the most unstable moment in both ML/AP directions and a crucial moment in control of gait stability. The results presented above might be applicable as basic data regarding dynamic stability of healthy young adults through a gait cycle for comparisons with elderly people and patients with orthopedic disorders or neurological disorders.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

However it is not know whether different tendon types respond in the same, or different ways, to changes in loading. This study performed in vitro un-loading (stress deprivation) in culture on ovine medial extensor tendons (MET, a positional tendon), and superficial and deep digital flexor tendons (SDFTs and DDFTs, with energy-storing and intermediate functions respectively), for 21 days (n = 14 each). Tensile strength and elastic modulus were then measured, followed by biochemical assays for sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and hydroxyproline content. Histological inspection for cell morphology, cell density and collagen alignment was also performed. The positional tendon (MET) had a significant reduction (∼50%) in modulus and strength (P < 0.001) after in vitro stress-deprivation, however there were no significant effects on the energy-storing tendons (SDFT and DDFT). In contrast, sGAG was not affected in the MET, but was reduced in the SDFT and DDFT (P < 0.001). All tendons lost compactness and collagen organisation, and had reduced cell density, but these were more rapid in the MET than the SDFT and DDFT. These results suggest that different tendon types respond to identical stimuli in different ways, thus; (i) the results from an experiment in one tendon type may not be as applicable to other tendon types as previously thought, (ii) positional tendons may be particularly vulnerable to clinical stress-deprivation, and (iii) graft tendon source may affect the biological response to loading in ligament and tendon reconstruction.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The loadsol® is a wireless load sensing insole that can be used in non-laboratory settings. The purpose of this study was to determine if the loadsol® could be used to predict knee extension moment and power symmetry during a bilateral stop jump task in healthy recreational athletes. Forty-two uninjured recreational athletes completed seven bilateral stop jumps. During each landing, the loadsol® (100 Hz) measured plantar load while 3D ground reaction forces (1920 Hz) and lower extremity kinematics (240 Hz) were collected simultaneously. Peak impact force, loading rate, and impulse were quantified using the loadsol® and peak knee extension moment, average knee extension moment, and total knee work was quantified using the laboratory instrumentation. Limb symmetry indices were quantified for each outcome measure. Multivariate backwards regressions were used to determine if loadsol® symmetry could predict knee kinetic symmetry. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots were used to determine the agreement and error between predicted and actual knee kinetic symmetry. Loadsol® impulse and peak impact force symmetry significantly predicted kinetic knee symmetry and explained 42-61% of its variance. There was good agreement (ICCs = 0.742-0.862) between predicted and actual knee kinetic symmetry, and the error in the predicted outcomes range from ±18 to ±43.

This study aimed to determine the thresholds of center of mass (COM) velocity and position relative to the base of support (BOS) that predict forward and backward loss of balance during walking with a range of BOS perturbations. Perturbations were modeled as sinusoidal BOS motions in the vertical or anterior-posterior direction or as sagittal rotation. The human body was modeled using a seven-link model. Forward dynamics alongside with dynamic optimization were used to find the thresholds of initial COM velocity for each initial COM position that would predict forward or backward loss of balance. The effects of perturbation frequency and amplitude on these thresholds were modeled based on the simulation data. Experimental data were collected from 15 able-bodied individuals and three individuals with disability during perturbed walking. The simulation results showed similarity with the stability region reported for slip and non-slip conditions. The feasible stability region shrank when the perturbation frequency and amplitude increased, especially for larger initial COM velocities. 89.5% (70.9%) and 82.4% (68.2%) of the measured COM position and velocity combinations during low (high) perturbations were located inside the simulated limits of the stability region, for able-bodied and disabled individuals, respectively.

The physiological range of strain rates at the two portions of locust SLP is quite broad in the periods of energy storage and release (approximately three orders). However, it still remains elusive how the mechanical properties of the two SLP portions change with the strain rate. We identified the elastic moduli and material compositions of SLP portions II and III by using nanoindentation and confocal laser scanning microscope. Apparent and creep-corrected reduced elastic moduli were calculated to represent the total energy absorption and storage, respectively. The results revealed that both portions II and III exhibit strain rate-sensitive elastic moduli, regardless of water content. The efficiency of elastic energy storage is only 51-70% in the case of low strain rate. This work can deepen our understanding in the energy storage and release mechanisms in locust locomotion and further provide guidelines for biomimetic design of power amplification apparatus in jumping robots.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Unmatched filtering procedures are reported to affect joint moment amplitudes in high impact movements, like landing or cutting, but are also common in the analysis of distance running. We analyzed the effects of cut-off frequencies in 94 rearfoot runners at a speed of 3.5 m/s. Additionally, we investigated whether the evaluation of footwear interventions is affected by the choice of cut-off frequencies. We performed 3D inverse dynamics for the hip, knee and ankle joints using different low-pass filter cut-off frequency combinations for a recursive fourth-order Butterworth filter. We observed fluctuations of joint moment curves in the first half of stance, which were most pronounced for the most unmatched cut-off frequency combination (kinematics: 10 Hz; ground reaction forces (GRFs): 100 Hz) and for more proximal joints. Peak sagittal plane hip joint moments were altered by 94% on average. We observed a change in the ranking of subjects based on joint moment amplitude. We found significant (p < 0.001) footwear by cut-off frequency combination interaction effects for most peak joint moments. These findings highlight the importance of cut-off frequency choice in the analysis of joint moments and the assessment of footwear interventions in distance running. Based on our results, we propose to use matched cut-off frequencies around 20 Hz in order to avoid large artificial fluctuations in joint moment curves while at the same time avoiding a severe removal of physiological high-frequency signal content from the GRF signals.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This umbrella review examined (1) what relationship, if any, is evident between specific spinal postures or physical activities and LBP; (2) the quality of existing systematic reviews in this area; and (3) the extent to which previous systematic reviews demonstrate causality. Five electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from January 1990 to June 2018.

The AMSTAR and the Bradford Hill Criteria were utilised to critically appraise the quality of included systematic reviews and to determine the extent to which these reviews demonstrated causality. Two independent reviewers screened 4285 publications with 41 reviews included in the final review. Both positive and null associations between spine posture, prolonged standing, sitting, bending and twisting, awkward postures, whole body vibration, and components of heavy physical work were reported. Results from meta-analyses were more consistently in favour of an association, whereas systematic reviews that included only prospective studies were less able to provide consistent conclusions.

Although gluteus medius activity has been associated with mediolateral foot placement, how other muscles contribute to foot placement is not clear. Furthermore, although dynamic walking models have suggested that anteroposterior foot placement can be passively controlled, the extent to which muscles actively contribute to anteroposterior foot placement has not been determined. The objective of this study was to identify individual muscle contributions to mediolateral and anteroposterior foot placement during walking in healthy adults. Dynamic simulations of walking were developed for six older adults and a segmental power analysis was performed to determine the individual muscle contributions to the mediolateral and anteroposterior power delivered to the foot segment. The simulations revealed the ipsilateral swing limb gluteus medius, iliopsoas, rectus femoris and hamstrings and the contralateral stance limb gluteus medius and ankle plantarflexors were primary contributors to both mediolateral and anteroposterior foot placement. Muscle contributions to foot placement were found to be highly influenced by their contributions to pelvis power, which was dominated by those muscles crossing the hip joint. Thus, impaired balance control may be improved by focusing rehabilitation interventions on optimizing the coordination of those muscles crossing the hip joint and the ankle plantarflexors.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For most individuals, articular cartilage facilitates a lifetime of pain-free ambulation, supporting millions of loading cycles from activities of daily living. Although early studies into osteoarthritis focused on the role of mechanical fatigue in articular cartilage degeneration, much is still unknown regarding its strength and endurance characteristics. The compressive strength of juvenile, bovine articular cartilage explants was determined to be loading rate-dependent, reaching a maximum strength of 29.5 ± 4.8 MPa at a strain rate of 0.10 %/sec. The fatigue and endurance properties of articular cartilage were characterized utilizing a material testing system, as well as a custom, validated instrument termed the two degrees-of-freedom endurance meter (endurometer). These instruments characterized fatigue in articular cartilage explants at loading levels ranging from 10 to 80 % strength (%S), up to 100,000 cycles. Cartilage explants displayed characteristics of fatigue - fatigue life increased as the loading magnitude decreased. All explants failed within 14,000 cycles at loading levels between 50 and 80 %S. At 10 and 20 %S, all explants endured 100,000 loading cycles. There was no significant difference in equilibrium compressive modulus between run-out explants and unloaded controls, although the pooled modulus increased in response to testing. Histological staining and biochemical assays revealed no material changes in collagen, sulfated glycosaminoglycan, or hydration content between unloaded controls and explants cyclically loaded to run-out.

Fifteen healthy young adults (23.4 ± 2.8 years old) participated in this study. The CAREN-Extended system was used to simulate unexpected slip perturbations in a safe environment while walking symmetrically and asymmetrically with various arm swings (normal, bound, released). Whole-body angular momentum (range), peak trunk angular velocities, step width and stance time were extracted before and after perturbations (when recovering from slip). All participants were able to recover their balance after two strides and no falls occurred. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in most gait parameters between pre- and post-perturbations. Arm conditions had significant effects on all gait parameters during both pre- and post-perturbation except for stance time. Compared to symmetric walking, walking asymmetrically before a perturbation led to larger step width and stance time among the different arm conditions both before and after the perturbations. Despite the presence of significant effects of different arm and walking conditions on most gait parameters during pre- and post-perturbation, participants were able to implement stabilization strategies to prevent fall even when they were prevented from using their normal arm swing, in both symmetric and asymmetric walking.

These models are often attempted to be validated using cadaver tissue displacements despite studies showing neural tissue degrades quickly after death. Addressing this limitation, this study aimed to develop a technique for quantifying living brain motion in vivo using a closed head impact animal model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) called CHIMERA. We implanted radiopaque markers within the brain of three adult ferrets and resealed the skull while the animals were anesthetized. We affixed additional markers to the skull to track skull kinematics. The CHIMERA device delivered controlled, repeatable head impacts to the head of the animals while the impacts were fluoroscopically stereo-visualized. We observed that 1.5 mm stainless steel fiducials (∼8 times the density of the brain) migrated from their implanted positions while neutral density targets remained in their implanted position post-impact. Brain motion relative to the skull was quantified in neutral density target tests and showed increasing relative motion at higher head impact severities. We observed the motion of the brain lagged behind that of the skull, similar to previous studies. This technique can be used to obtain a comprehensive dataset of in vivo brain motion to validate computational models reflecting the mechanical properties of the living brain.

However, the effects of curcumin extracts on the deformability of erythrocytes have not yet been evaluated. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the effects of pre-treatment with curcumin extract on erythrocyte deformation and erythrocyte band 3 (SLC4A1; EB3) expression. We also evaluated the associations between EB3 expression and erythrocyte deformability induced by hydrogen peroxide. Blood samples were divided into the control group, pre-treatment group (treated with curcumin extract or vitamin C), and negative control group, and oxidant stress parameters, antioxidant status, erythrocyte deformability and elasticity, and EB3 modifications were evaluated using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Hydrogen peroxide significantly increased oxidative stress parameters, modulus elasticity values and clustered EB3 levels and induced conjugation of membrane proteins to form high-molecular-weight complexes (p < 0.05). Erythrocyte deformability and elasticity were significantly decreased in the treated groups compared with those in the control group. Overall, our findings suggested that pre-treatment with curcumin extracts increased antioxidant status, reduced EB3 cross-linking, and improved erythrocyte deformability, to an even better extent than vitamin C. These results provide important insights into the effects of treatment with curcumin extracts on erythrocyte damage and suggest that curcumin may have applications in antioxidant therapy.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Too much BFb, however, can foster dependency leading to skill retention deficits once removed. A reducing BFb schedule could negate dependency effects, however limited methodologies exist to assess the effectiveness of an intervention during application. This research proposes a new bi-variate method (CI2Area) to quantify coordination variability (CoordVar) as a measure of skill exploration during a motor learning intervention. Thirty-two participants were introduced to a novel explosive-lunge task. A BFb group (n = 16) were provided with visual BFb on rear hip, knee and ankle joint extension magnitudes and timing during a 26-week reducing schedule BFb intervention. CoordVar of hip-knee and knee-ankle angular velocities were quantified by calculating the area encompassed by the 95% confidence intervals of joint coupling angular-velocity bi-variate plots (CI2Area). Linear regressions were fitted to group and individual CoordVar longitudinal data. The BFb was effective in successfully altering whole limb technique within just two sessions, and these changes were retained. The BFb group demonstrated a continual increase of CoordVar throughout the intervention, showing continual skill exploration strategies, while the Control group remained unchanged.

This study reports the variability, agreement and reliability of osseous landmarks to better understand their downstream effects. Fifteen landmarks were defined on the distal femur and twelve on the proximal tibia. Surface meshes were created from twenty right knee MRI scans with a mean subject age of 30.9 years. A single observer identified landmarks on all twenty knees, while three observers repeated the observations three times on a subset of eight knees. All observations were aligned to the Procrustes mean shapes. Principal component analysis was used to study inter-subject variability and two-way ANOVA for inter- and intra-observer agreement and reliability. Inter-subject landmark variation ranged from 0.6 to 5.26 mm, while inter- and intra-observer agreement were at most 5.1 and 5.69 mm respectively. Between-observer reliability ranged from 0.07 to 0.98 while within-observer values were between 0.51 and 0.98.

Conventional prostheses have fixed ankle set-point angles and cannot fully replicate able-bodied ankle dynamics. Microprocessor-controlled ankles have been developed to help overcome these limitations. The objective of this study was to characterize how the slope adaptation feature of a microprocessor-controlled ankle affected individual prosthesis user gait biomechanics during sloped walking. Previous studies on similar microprocessor-controlled ankles have focused on group-level results (inter-subject mean), but did not report individual subject results. Our study builds upon prior work and provides new insight by presenting subject-specific results and investigating to what extent individual responses agree with the group-level results. We performed gait analysis on seven individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation while they walked on a 7.5° incline with a recently redesigned microprocessor-controlled ankle that adjusts ankle set-point angle to the slope. We computed gait kinematics and kinetics, and compared how users walked with vs. without this set-point adjustment. The microprocessor-controlled ankle increased minimum toe clearance for all subjects. Despite the microprocessor-controlled ankle behaving similarly for each user, we observed marked differences in individual responses. For instance, two users switched from a forefoot landing pattern with the microprocessor-controlled ankle locked at neutral angle to rearfoot landing when the microprocessor-controlled ankle adapted to the slope, while two maintained a forefoot and three maintained a rearfoot landing pattern across conditions. Changes in knee angle and moment were also subject-specific. Individual user responses were often not well represented by inter-subject mean. Although the prevailing experimental paradigm in prosthetic gait analysis studies is to focus on group-level analysis, our findings call attention to the high inter-subject variability which may necessitate alternative experimental approaches to assess prosthetic interventions.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This could be the result of an increase in axial pelvis range of motion (ROM) which has been observed in these patients as well. To establish this relationship, we investigated if altered axial pelvis ROM during gait affects thorax-pelvis relative phase in 12 healthy subjects. These subjects walked on a treadmill and received real-time feedback on axial pelvis rotations. Subjects were asked to (1) walk normal, and walk with (2) decreased and (3) increased pelvis ROM. Gait speed and stride frequency were matched between trials. Subjects were able to increase pelvis ROM to a large extent, but the reduction in pelvis ROM was relatively small. Walking with large pelvis ROM resulted in a change in thorax-pelvis relative phase similar to that in pelvic girdle pain and low back pain. A forward dynamic model was used to predict the effect of manipulation of pelvis ROM on timing of thorax rotations independent of apparent axial trunk stiffness and arm swing amplitude (which can both affect thorax-pelvis relative phase). The model predicted a similar, even larger, effect of large axial pelvis ROM on thorax-pelvis relative phase, as observed experimentally. We conclude that walking with actively increased ROM of axial pelvis rotations in healthy subjects is associated with a shift in thorax-pelvis relative phase, similar to observations in patients with pelvic girdle pain and low back pain.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Experimental hip simulator testing under edge loading conditions has produced increased, clinically-relevant, wear rates for hard-on-hard bearings when compared to concentric conditions. Such testing, however, is time consuming and costly. A quick running computational edge loading model (Python Edge Loading (PyEL) - quasi-static, rigid, frictionless), capable of considering realistic bearing geometries, was developed. The aim of this study was to produce predictions of separation within the typical experimental measurement error of ∼0.5 mm. The model was verified and validated against comparable finite element (FE) models (including inertia and friction) and pre-existing experimental test data for 56 cases, covering a variety of simulated cup orientations, positions, tissue tensions, and loading environments. The PyEL model agreed well with both the more complex computational modelling and experimental results. From comparison with the FE models, the assumption of no inertia had little effect on the maximum separation prediction. With high contact force cases, the assumption of no friction had a larger effect (up to ∼5% error). The PyEL model was able to predict the experimental maximum separations within ∼0.3 mm. It could therefore be used to optimise an experimental test plan and efficiently investigate a much wider range of scenarios and variables. It could also help explain trends and damage modes seen in experimental testing through identifying the contact locations on the liner that are not easily measured experimentally.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This study aims to investigate midtarsal joint locking during walking by noninvasively measuring the movements of foot bones using a high-speed bi-planar fluoroscopic system. Eighteen healthy subjects volunteered for the study; the subjects underwent computed tomography imaging and bi-planar radiographs of the foot in order to measure the three-dimensional (3D) midtarsal joint kinematics using a 2D-to-3D registration method and anatomical coordinate system in each bone. The relative movements on bone surfaces were also calculated in the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints and quantified as surface relative velocity vectors on articular surfaces to understand the kinematic interactions in the midtarsal joint. The midtarsal joint performed a coupled motion in the early stance to pronate the foot to extreme pose in the range of motion during walking and maintained this pose during the mid-stance. In the terminal stance, the talonavicular joint performed plantar-flexion, inversion, and internal rotation while the calcaneocuboid joint performed mainly inversion. The midtarsal joint moved towards an extreme supinated pose, rather than a minimum motion in the terminal stance. The study provides a new perspective to understand the kinematics and kinetics of the movement of foot bones and so-called midtarsal joint locking, during walking. The midtarsal joint continuously moved towards extreme poses together with the activation of muscle forces, which would support the foot for more effective force transfer during push-off in the terminal stance.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This knowledge is also foundational for surgical simulation and clinical interventions leveraging manipulation of the musculoskeletal surfaces. Injuries to musculoskeletal extremities are common and surgical and preventive interventions require interactions between various objects such as surgical tools and support surfaces with tissue boundaries. While a handful of investigations examined the variations in indentation mechanics due to pathology or injury specific sites, a comprehensive analysis across the surfaces of musculoskeletal extremities has not been completed. In this study we examine variations of surface stiffness across 8 sites of the upper and lower arms and legs for 95 subjects using an instrumented ultrasound device. Differences in surface stiffness were observed between gender, activity level, and indentation location groups. The lower arm posterior location had the highest average stiffness (3.89 × 10-3 MPa/mm), while the lowest stiffness was observed at the upper leg posterior location (0.98 × 10-3 MPa/mm). The differences between indentation sites were larger in magnitude when compared to differences due to demographics (gender and activity level). However the large ranges of the 95% confidence intervals suggest that an aggregated metric based on population or sub-group may not capture individual variations. This study implicates the motivation to explore tissue composition variations within the indentation sites as well as the potential importance to include variations in surface stiffness during surgical simulations.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

This 'perspectives article' critically examines, from a dynamical systems theoretical standpoint, the claim that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques can be identified through biomechanical optimisation modelling. To identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques, dynamical systems theory suggests that a representative set of organismic constraints, along with their non-linear characteristics, needs to be identified and incorporated into the mathematical model of the athlete. However, whether the athlete will be able to adopt, and reliably reproduce, his/her predicted optimum technique will largely be dependent on his/her intrinsic dynamics. If the attractor valley corresponding to the existing technique is deep, or if the attractor valleys corresponding to the existing technique and the predicted optimum technique are in different topographical regions of the dynamic landscape, technical modifications may be challenging or impossible to reliably implement even after extended practice. The attractor layout defining the intrinsic dynamics of the athlete, therefore, needs to be determined to establish the likelihood of the predicted optimum technique being reliably attainable by the athlete. Given the limited set of organismic constraints typically used in mathematical models of athletes, combined with the methodological challenges associated with mapping the attractor layout of an athlete, it seems unlikely that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques will be identifiable through biomechanical optimisation modelling for the majority of sports skills in the near future.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False

Although previous studies have investigated lumbopelvic kinetics for a single velocity, it is unclear whether each lumbopelvic torque should increase for faster running. We examined the relationship between running velocity and lumbopelvic kinetics. We calculated the three-dimensional lumbosacral kinetics of 10 male sprinters during steady-state running on a temporary indoor running track at five target velocities: 3.0 (3.20 ± 0.16), 4.5 (4.38 ± 0.18), 6.0 (5.69 ± 0.47), 7.5 (7.30 ± 0.41), and maximal sprinting (9.27 ± 0.36 m/s). The lumbosacral axial rotation torque increased more markedly (from 0.37 ± 0.06 to 1.99 ± 0.46 Nm/kg) than the extension and lateral flexion torques. The increase in the axial rotation torque was larger above 7.30 m/s. Conversely, the extension and lateral flexion torques plateaued when running velocity increased above 7.30 m/s. Similar results were observed for mechanical work. The results indicate that faster running required larger lumbosacral axial rotation torque. Conversely, the extension and lateral flexion torques were relatively invariant to running velocity above 7 m/s, implying that faster running below 7 m/s might increase the biomechanical loads causing excessive pelvic posterior tilt and excessive pelvic drop which has the potential to cause pain/injury related to lumbopelvic extensors and lateral flexors, whereas these biomechanical loads might not relate with running velocity above 7 m/s.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

We formulate a general Kirchhoff-Lagrangian dynamics model of the legs-propulsion through the water in post-surgical rehabilitation swimming. We start by defining the two-leg-propulsion configuration manifold. This is composed of eight Euclidean groups of rigid motions in 3D space for each of the four leg segments. Next, we define Newton-Euler dynamics for each segment. This single segmental dynamics is further generalized into Lagrangian dynamics for the whole leg-propulsion system. Finally, the water effects are added in the form of Kirchhoff's vector cross-products. In agreement with orthopaedic recommendations for post-surgical rehabilitation, numerical simulation is performed on a simplified version of the full Kirchhoff-Lagrangian dynamics model, which we call the ""robotic swimming leg"" - with intentionally reduced number of (microscopic, non-sagittal) degrees-of-freedom.

Timing and magnitude aspects of lumbo-pelvic coordination during a trunk forward bending and backward return task along with subjective measures of pain and disability were collected at three-time points over a six-month period from 29 patients who had non-chronic LBP at the time of enrollment in the study. To enable investigation of abnormalities in lumbo-pelvic coordination of patients, we also included lumbo-pelvic coordination data of age and gender-matched back healthy individuals from an earlier study of our group. Finally, differences in lumbo-pelvic coordination between patients with moderate-severe LBP (i.e., those whose level of pain was ≥ 4 (out of 10) at all three data collection sessions; n = 8) and patients with low-moderate LBP (n = 21) were investigated. There were clear distinctions in measures of lumbo-pelvic coordination between patients with low-moderate and moderate-severe LBP. Contrary to our expectation, however, the abnormalities in magnitude aspects of lumbo-pelvic coordination were larger (F > 4.84, P < 0.012) in patients with low-moderate LBP. These abnormalities in patients with low-moderate LBP, compared to controls, included larger (>12°) pelvic and thoracic rotations as well as smaller (>10°) lumbar flexion. The abnormal lumbo-pelvic coordination of patients with non-specific LBP, observed at baseline, persisted (F < 1.96, P > 0.156) or worsen (F > 3.48, P < 0.04) over the course of study period despite significant improvement in their pain (18% decrease; F = 12.10, P < 0.001) and disability (10% decrease; F = 4.39, P = 0.017). Distinct but lingering abnormalities in lumbo-pelvic coordination, observed in patients with low-moderate and moderate-severe LBP, might have a role in persistence and/or relapse of symptoms in patients with non-specific LBP.

Intermuscular bones of teleost fish have previously been described to play a role in the mechanical force transmission between muscle and bone, but their biomechanical properties are not yet fully described. Here, we have investigated intermuscular bones (IBs) of the North Atlantic Herring with regard to their structure and micro-architecture, mineral-related properties, and micro-mechanical tensile properties.

Another cohort, containing 36 bones from 7 smaller fish and 36 bones from 6 larger fish, was used for microCT. Results show some astonishing properties of the IBs: (i) IBs present higher ductility, lower Young's modulus but similar strength and TMD (Tissue Mineral Density) compared to mammalian bone, and (ii) IBs from small fish were 49% higher in Young's modulus than fish bones from larger fish while their TMD was not statistically different and crystal length was 8% higher in large fish bones.

Because of the practical constraints of in-vivo experiments, the finite element (FE) method is commonly used to determine the CR. The objective of this study was to investigate the geometric model details required for accurate CR determination, and the effect of material non-linearity of the periodontal ligament (PDL). A FE model of a human lower canine derived from a high-resolution µCT scan (voxel size: 50 µm) was investigated by applying four different modelling approaches to the PDL. These comprised linear and non-linear material models, each with uniform and realistic PDL thickness. The CR locations determined for the four model configurations were in the range 37.2-45.3% (alveolar margin: 0%; root apex: 100%). We observed that a non-linear material model introduces load-dependent results that are dominated by the PDL regions under tension. Load variation within the range used in clinical orthodontic practice resulted in CR variations below 0.3%. Furthermore, the individualized realistic PDL geometry shifted the CR towards the alveolar margin by 2.3% and 2.8% on average for the linear and non-linear material models, respectively. We concluded that for conventional clinical therapy and the generation of representative reference data, the least sophisticated modelling approach with linear material behaviour and uniform PDL thickness appears sufficiently accurate. Research applications that require more precise treatment monitoring and planning may, however, benefit from the more accurate results obtained from the non-linear constitutive law and individualized realistic PDL geometry.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Most of the previous musculoskeletal models are based on multibody dynamics simulation with muscles simplified as one-dimensional (1D) line-segments without accounting for the large muscle attachment areas, spatial fibre alignment within muscles and contact and wrapping between muscles and surrounding tissues. In previous musculoskeletal models with three-dimensional (3D) muscles, contractions of muscles were among the inputs rather than calculated, which hampers the predictive capability of these models. To address these issues, a finite element musculoskeletal model with the ability to predict contractions of 3D muscles was developed. Muscles with realistic 3D geometry, spatial muscle fibre alignment and muscle-muscle and muscle-bone interactions were accounted for. Active contractile stresses of the 3D muscles were determined through an efficient optimization approach based on the measured kinematics of the lower extremity and ground force during gait. This model also provided stresses and strains of muscles and contact mechanics of the muscle-muscle and muscle-bone interactions. The total contact force of the knee predicted by the model corresponded well to the in vivo measurement. Contact and wrapping between muscles and surrounding tissues were evident, demonstrating the need to consider 3D contact models of muscles.

However, a detailed and regional characterization of these strains in the RV is very limited. In the current study, RV images were obtained with 3D spiral cine DENSE MRI in healthy rats. An algorithm for surface growing was proposed in order to fit irregular topology. Specifically, a new custom plugin for the DENSEanalysis program, called 3D DENSE Plugin for Crescent Organ, was developed for surface reconstruction and precise segmentation of organs with sharp curvature, such as the murine RV. The RV free wall (RVFW) was divided into three longitudinal thirds (i.e., basal, middle, and apical) with each one partitioned into circumferential fourths (i.e., anterior, anteriorlateral, inferiorlateral and inferior). Peak systolic strains were quantified for each segment and comparisons were performed statistically. The inclusion of a new plugin was able to generate global values for Ecc and Ell that are in good agreement with previous findings using MRI. Despite no regional variation found in the peak Ecc, the peak Ell exhibited regional variation at the anterior side of the RV, which is potentially due to differences in biventricular torsion at the RV insertion point and fiber architecture. These results provide fundamental insights into the regional contractile function of the RV in healthy rat and could act as a normative baseline for future studies on regional changes induced by disease or treatment.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this work is to quantify how the quality of routine clinical data, from which the patient-specific models are built, affects the outputs of the numerical models representing the pathological condition of stenotic aortic valve. Seven fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were performed, completed with a sensitivity analysis on patient-specific reconstructed geometries and boundary conditions. The structural parts of the models consisted of the aortic root, native tri-leaflets valve and calcifications. Ventricular and aortic pressure curves were applied to the fluid domain. The differences between clinical data and numerical results for the aortic valve area were less than 2% but reached 12% when boundary conditions and geometries were changed. The difference in the aortic stenosis jet velocity between measured and simulated values was less than 11% reaching 27% when the geometry was changed.

In face of these advantages, stent-graft performances are still clinically suboptimal. In particular, post-surgical complications derive from device migration as a consequence of the hemodynamic forces acting on the endograft. In this regard, while the importance of hemodynamic surface forces is well recognized, the role of the in-stent flow is still unclear. Here we hypothesize that in-stent helical blood flow patterns might influence the distribution of the displacement forces (DFs) acting on the stent-graft and, ultimately, the risk of stent migration. To test this hypothesis, the hemodynamics of 20 post-EVAR models of patients treated with two different commercial endografts was analyzed using computational hemodynamics. The main findings of the study indicate that: (1) helical flow intensity decreases the risk of endograft migration, as given by an inverse correlation between helicity intensity (h2) and time-averaged displacement forces (TADFs) (p < 0.05); (2) unbalanced counter-rotating helical structures in the legs of the device contribute, in particular along the systole, to significantly suppress TADFs (p < 0.01); (3) as expected, helical flow intensity is positively correlated with pressure drop and resistance to flow (p < 0.001).

The pitchers were fitted with six surface electromyography (EMG) bipolar electrodes on the stride leg biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, ipsilateral side lower trapezius, upper trapezius, triceps brachii and biceps brachii. Each pitcher underwent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) testing and then performed the fastball & curveball pitching sequence. All EMG variables of interest were normalized using MVIC data and compared between pitching type. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for all muscle activity as well. If significance was found a pairwise analysis (Bonferroni) was performed between pitch type, using SPSS (p 0.05). Significant differences in the mean muscle activity for the fastball and curveball pitched from the stretch were observed. A higher level of muscle activity was found for the stretch fastball when compared to the stretch curveball. This study was able to provide a baseline measurement of muscle activity; however, kinematics and kinetics should be measured in future studies.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

The aim of this in vitro study therefore was to quantify the kinematics and elastostatics of the human rib cage under defined boundary conditions. Eight fresh frozen human thoracic spine specimens (C7-L1, median age 55 years, ranging from 40 to 60 years) including entire rib cages were loaded quasi-statically in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation using pure moments of 5Nm. Relative motions of ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and sternal structures as well as strains on the ribs were measured using optical motion tracking of 150 reflective markers per specimen, while specimens were loaded displacement-controlled with a constant rate of 1°/s for 3.5 cycles. The third full cycle was used to determine relative angles and strains at full loading of the spine for all motion directions. Largest relative angles were found in the main loading directions with only small motions at the mid-thoracic levels. Highest strains of the intercostal spaces were detected in the anterior section of the lowest fourth of the rib cage, showing compressions and elongations of more than 10% in all spinal motion planes. Elastostatic rib deformation was generally less than 1%. Rib-sternum relative motions exhibited complex motion patterns, overall showing relative angles below 2°. The results indicate that rib cage structures are not macroscopically deformed during spinal motion, but exhibit characteristic reproducible kinematics patterns.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Evaluation of aspiration catheter geometry.,"Aspiration thrombectomy is one of the most effective systems for blood clot removal and vessel recanalization. We present the results of a study involving the modelling and extraction of blood clots in the arteries of the human body using the following computer tools: Bond-Graph methodology for the fluid domain and Multi-Body Simulation for the mechanical domain. The modelling for the mechanical domain focuses on the clot and the distal end section of an aspiration device. Our final model considers an elastic characterization of the blood clot with progressive detachment from the vessel wall. We conclude that the results of such modelling could potentially improve the effectiveness of blood clot removal by reducing the risk of clot fragmentation. Such modelling could also potentially provide an adjunct technique in improving recanalization of arteries over a range of given parameters (mechanical properties of the vessel, mechanical properties of the blood clot, blood clot length, suction pressure, catheter - clot distance, catheter shape, catheter diameter and vessel occlusion).",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

These foot types were determined by specific static morphologic features and included rectus (well aligned hindfoot/forefoot), planus (low arched), and cavus (high arched) foot types. Unique biomechanical characteristics of these foot types have been identified but reported differences in segmental foot kinematics among them has been inconsistent due to differences in neutral referencing and evaluation of only select discrete variables. This study used the radiographically-indexed Milwaukee Foot Model to evaluate differences in segmental foot kinematics among healthy adults with rectus, planus, and cavus feet based on the true bony alignment between segments. Based on the definitions of the individual foot types and due to conflicting results in previous literature, the primary study outcome was peak coronal hindfoot position during stance phase. Additionally, locally weighted regression smoothing with alpha-adjusted serial t-test analysis (LAAST) was used to compare these foot types across the entire gait cycle. Average peak hindfoot inversion was -1.6° ± 5.1°, 6.7° ± 3.5°, and 13.6° ± 4.6°, for the Planus, Rectus, and Cavus Groups, respectively. There were significant differences among all comparisons. Differences were observed between the Rectus and Planus Groups and Cavus and Planus Groups throughout the gait cycle. Additionally, the Planus Group had a premature peak velocity toward coronal varus and early transition toward valgus, likely due to a deficient windlass mechanism. This assessment of kinematic data across the gait cycle can help understand differences in dynamic foot function among foot types.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

For the motor plan to be effective, it must be adapted in response to environmental changes. Despite motor planning being inherent to goal-directed walking, it is not understood how the nervous system adapts these plans to interact with changing environments. Our objective was to understand how people adapt motor plans of center of mass (COM) trajectory during goal-directed walking in response to a consistent change in environmental dynamics. Participants preformed a series of goal-directed walking trials in a novel environment created by a cable robot that applied a lateral force field to their COM. We hypothesized that participants would adapt to the environment by forming an internal model of their COM trajectory within the force field. Our findings support this hypothesis. Initially, we found COM trajectory significantly deviated in the same direction as the applied field, relative to baseline (no field) (p = 0.002). However, with practice in the field, COM trajectory adapted back to the baseline (p = 0.6). When we unexpectedly removed the field, participants demonstrated after-effects, COM trajectory deviated in the direction opposite of the field relative to baseline (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that when performing a goal-directed walking task, people adapt a motor plan that predicts the COM trajectory that will emerge from the interaction between a specific set of motor commands and the external environment.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Fifteen females and fifteen males walked on a treadmill for 2-min at a constant speed under three symmetric load conditions (unloaded: 1.71 kg, medium: 15 kg, heavy: 26 kg). Kinematic and kinetics of the hip and knee were calculated in the sagittal and frontal planes of the dominant limb. In females, hip abduction moments (normalized to total mass) and sagittal knee excursion decreased with increased load (p ≤ 0.024). In males, hip frontal excursion and adduction angle increased with load (p ≤ 0.003). Females had greater peak hip adduction angle than males in the unloaded and medium load conditions (p ≤ 0.036). Across sex, sagittal hip and knee excursion, peak knee extension angle, and peak hip and knee flexion angles increased with increased load (p ≤ 0.005). When normalized to body mass, all peak joint moments increased with each load (p ≤ 0.016) except peak hip adduction moment. When normalized to total mass, peak hip adduction moment and knee flexion, extension, and adduction moments decreased with each load (p < 0.001). While hip frontal plane kinetic alterations to load were only noted in females, kinematic changes were noted in males at the hip and females at the knee. Differences in strategies may increase the risk of hip and knee injuries in females compared to males.

This combination of analysis at tissular, structural and microstructural levels highlighted the following: (i) a linear mechanical response for the dissected intimomedial flap and, conversely, nonlinear behaviour for both healthy and dissected ascending aorta; all showed anisotropy; (ii) a stiffer mechanical response in the longitudinal than in the circumferential direction for the healthy ascending aorta, consistent with the histological quantification of collagen and elastin fibre density; (iii) a link between dissection and ascending aorta stiffening, as revealed by biaxial tensile tests. This result was corroborated by in vivo measurements with stiffness index, β, and Peterson modulus, Ep, higher for patients with dissection than for control patients. It was consistent with histological analysis on dissected samples showing elastin fibre dislocations, reduced elastin density and increased collagen density.

Eleven healthy adults completed 34 trails per walking velocity over an 8-m, custom-built track with two forceplates embedded in its center. For the expected stepdown, the track was lowered by 0-, -10- and -20-cm from the site of the second forceplate, whereas the unexpected stepdown was created by camouflaging the second forceplate (-10-cm). Two-way repeated-measurement ANOVAs detected no velocity-related effects of stepdown on kinematic and kinetic parameters during lead limb stance-phase, and on the trail limb stepping kinematics. However, analyses of significant interactions revealed greater peak flexion angles across the trunk and the trail limb joints (hip, knee and ankle) in unexpected versus expected stepdown conditions at a faster walking velocity. The -10-cm unexpected stepdown (main effect) had a greater influence on locomotor behavior compared to expected conditions due mainly to the absence of predictive adjustments, reflected by a significant decrease in peak knee flexion, contact time and vertical impulse during stance-phase. Walking faster (main effect) was associated with an increase in hip peak flexion and net anteroposterior impulse, and a decrease in contact time and vertical impulse during stepdown. The trail limb, in response, swung forward faster, generating a larger and faster recovery step. However, such reactive stepping following unexpected stepdown was yet a sparse compensation for an unstable body configuration, assessed by significantly smaller step width and anteroposterior margin-of-stability at foot-contact in the first-recovery-step compared with expected conditions.

Few studies examined the relationship between characteristics required to produce a stepping response with one of the postural perturbation methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between perturbation characteristics (applied force and displacement) required to elicit a forward stepping response with platform-translation and shoulder-pull methods, and to establish whether a common set of perturbation characteristics existed across both perturbation methods. Fourteen young healthy males participated. Temporally unexpected platform translations and shoulder pulls were induced by release of free weights, which fell a controlled height exerting a pull on the platform or on the participant via a shoulder harness. Participants responded with either feet-in-place or stepping responses. The force and displacement were varied to investigate the range of force-displacement combinations required to elicit stepping responses. Force-displacement combinations that elicited stepping responses were recorded and normalized to the participant's body weight (BW) and the base of support (BOS; participant's foot length). The lowest force and associated displacement that elicited stepping responses showed an inverse linear relationship during both platform-translation and shoulder-pull trials. The lowest force-displacement combination common to both perturbation methods was found to be 8.75%BW and 105%BOS, which, in the future work, could enable a direct comparison of the neuromuscular and biomechanical responses to different perturbation methods in a manner that attempts to equilibrate the perturbation stimulus across the methods.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Twelve male collegiate students (heel-strikers) performed walking at 1.5 m/s, jogging at 2.5 m/s, and running at 3.5 m/s. A custom-made sliding platform was used to provide the different shear cushion conditions. The shear cushion conditions were fixed (a fixed platform; control group), stiff (K = 2746 N/m), medium stiff (K = 2256 N/m), medium soft (K = 1667 N/m), and soft (K = 1079 N/m). The results showed that all cushion conditions produced sliding displacement and delayed the TPPSF during walking, jogging, and running compared with fixed condition. The APLR and MPLR were lowest under medium soft condition during walking, while the PPSF was similar between medium soft and soft conditions. For jogging and running, the PPSF as well as APLR and MPLR were the lowest under medium stiff condition except the maximum PLR was similar among stiff, medium stiff, and medium soft conditions during running. In conclusion, shear cushion produces appropriate sliding displacement and effectively delays the TPPSF to provide the musculoskeletal system additional time to absorb the impact and reduce loading.

Moreover, changes to cell mechanical properties under varied micro-environmental conditions can both influence and indicate fundamental changes to cell behavior. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a well established, powerful tool to capture geometric and mechanical properties of cells. We have previously demonstrated substantial functional and behavioral differences between aortic and pulmonary valve interstitial cells (VIC) using AFM and subsequent models of VIC mechanical response. In the present work, we extend these studies by demonstrating that to best interpret the spatially distributed AFM data, the use of spatial statistics is required. Spatial statistics includes formal techniques to analyze spatially distributed data, and has been used successfully in the analysis of geographic data. Thus, spatially mapped AFM studies of cell geometry and mechanics are analogous to more traditional forms of geospatial data. We are able to compare the spatial autocorrelation of stiffness in aortic and pulmonary valve interstitial cells, and more accurately capture cell geometry from height recordings. Specifically, we showed that pulmonary valve interstitial cells display higher levels of spatial autocorrelation of stiffness than aortic valve interstitial cells. This suggests that aortic VICs form different stress fiber structures than their pulmonary counterparts, in addition to being more highly expressed and stiffer on average. Thus, the addition of spatial statistics can contribute to our fundamental understanding of the differences between cell types. Moving forward, we anticipate that this work will be meaningful to enhance direct analysis of experimental data and for constructing high fidelity computational of VICs and other cell models.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

In this work, an experiment-driven computational study was conducted to examine the aerodynamics in human pharyngeal airway. An anatomically accurate pharynx model associated with different uvula kinematics was reconstructed from human magnetic resonance image (MRI) and high-speed photography. An immersed-boundary-method (IBM)-based direct numerical simulation (DNS) flow solver was adopted to simulate the corresponding unsteady flows in all their complexity. Analyses were performed on vortex dynamics and pressure fluctuations in the pharyngeal airway and force oscillations on the pharyngeal wall under the influence of varying airway obstructions, uvula flapping mode, and uvula flapping frequencies. It was found the vortex formation, aerodynamic pressure, and pharyngeal wall force were significantly affected by the width of the pharyngeal airway. By contrast, the influences from the uvula flapping mode were insignificant when other parameters were similar. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) analysis of the pressure time history revealed the existence of higher order harmonics of base frequency with significant pressure amplitudes and energy intensities. It was also found the airway pressure and pharyngeal wall force oscillate more dramatically at higher uvula flapping frequencies, which tends to promote the collapse of pharyngeal wall and initiates sleep apnea.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Especially, the morphological degeneration of the trochlear region dramatically affects the overall knee biomechanics and, from a clinical point of view, the staging of such a degeneration is fundamental to tailor the optimal therapeutic solution. The description of morphological variability and pathological inter-subject differences of the trochlea can be achieved by means of statistical shape modeling of a set of three-dimensional surfaces. This representation encodes information, spread into the dataset, in terms of modes of variations that model global, regional and even local morphological features. In view of that, the aim of this study was to develop a statistical shape model of the distal femur to capture the variability of the trochlear region into specific modes of variation and to study the interplay between the variation of the trochlea and the condylar regions. Using CT scans of patients affected by different levels of abnormality of the trochlear region, the distal femur geometries were co-registered to a reference shape using the pair-wise correspondence approach and principal component analysis provided the key modes of variation (MoVs). Apart from the first two MoVs, which described the global magnitude of the femur and the shaft length, the main following ones showed high correlation with sulcus depth (r2=0.70), sulcus angle (r2=0.70), lateral trochlear inclination (r2=0.66), and height of the two condylar facets in the anterior direction (r2=0.66), whose abnormal variations are typical signs of trochlear degeneration. High interplay between trochlear abnormalities and notch width (r2=0.71), lateral condylar size (r2=0.67), and medial condylar size (r2=0.99) was found. Interestingly, the model predicted morphological associations not included in the training dataset, nonetheless difficult to demonstrate physiologically. Interestingly from a biomechanical point of view, the distribution of some MoVs was found statistically different across the patients featuring physiological and pathological ranges of hip-knee-ankle alignment, femoral internal-external rotation and tibial slope. However, no linear correlation was found between the angular indexes and such MoVs. As a result, we can assert that statistical modeling of the distal femur are to date an effective way to visualize and quantify abnormalities of the trochlear regions supporting the introduction of advanced analysis, diagnostic and treatment support tools to elucidate physiologic and pathological variability in the morphology, to drive the staging and assist the selection of the optimal treatment option tailored to the patient.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Application to human induced pluripotent stem cell culture.,"Three-dimensional dynamic suspension is becoming an effective cell culture method for a wide range of bioprocesses, with an increasing number of bioreactors proposed for this purpose. The complex hydrodynamics establishing within these devices affects bioprocess outcomes and efficiency, and usually expensive in vitro trial-and-error experiments are needed to properly set the working parameters. Here we propose a methodology to define a priori the hydrodynamic working parameters of a dynamic suspension bioreactor, selected as a test case because of the complex hydrodynamics characterizing its operating condition. A combination of computational and analytical approaches was applied to generate operational guideline graphs for defining a priori specific working parameters. In detail, 43 simulations were performed under pulsed flow regime to characterize advective transport within the device depending on different operative conditions, i.e., culture medium flow rate and its duty cycle, cultured particle diameter, and initial particle suspension volume. The operational guideline graphs were then used to set specific hydrodynamic working parameters for an in vitro proof-of-principle test, where human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) aggregates were cultured for 24 h within the bioreactor. The in vitro findings showed that, under the selected pulsed flow regime, sedimentation was avoided, hiPSC aggregate circularity and viability were preserved, and culture heterogeneity was reduced, thus confirming the appropriateness of the a priori method. This methodology has the potential to be adaptable to other dynamic suspension devices to support experimental studies by providing in silico-based a priori knowledge, useful to limit costs and to optimize culture bioprocesses.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Disease and injury can disrupt force generation, but it can be challenging to separate passive from active contributions to these changes. Ultrasound elastography is a promising tool for characterizing the mechanical properties of muscles and the forces that they generate. Most prior work using ultrasound elastography in muscle has focused on the group velocity of shear waves, which increases with increasing muscle force. Few studies have quantified the phase velocity, which depends on the viscoelastic properties of muscle. Since passive and active forces within muscle involve different structures for force transmission, we hypothesized that measures of phase velocity could detect changes in shear wave propagation during active and passive conditions that cannot be detected when considering only group velocity. We measured phase and group velocity in the human biceps brachii during active and passive force generation and quantified the differences in estimates of shear elasticity obtained from each of these measurements. We found that measures of group velocity consistently overestimate the shear elasticity of muscle. We used a Voigt model to characterize the phase velocity and found that the estimated time constant for the Voigt model provided a way to distinguish between passive and active force generation. Our results demonstrate that shear wave elastography can be used to distinguish between passive and active force generation when it is used to characterize the phase velocity of shear waves propagating in muscle.",False,Journal of biomechanics,False

Until recently direct measurements of GRF during sprinting were limited to a few steps per trial, but a simple method (SM) was developed to estimate GRF across an entire acceleration. The SM utilizes displacement- or velocity-time data and basic computations applied to the runner's center of mass and was validated against compiled force plate (FP) measurements; however, this validation used multiple-trials to generate a single acceleration profile, and consequently fatigue and error may have introduced noise into the analyses. In this study, we replicated the original validation by comparing the main sprint kinetics and force-velocity-power variables (e.g. GRF and its horizontal and vertical components, mechanical power output, ratio of horizontal component to resultant GRF) between synchronized FP data from a single sprinting acceleration and SM data derived from running velocity measured with a 100 Hz laser. These analyses were made possible thanks to a newly developed 50-m FP system providing seamless GRF data during a single sprint acceleration. Sixteen trained male sprinters performed two all-out 60-m sprints. We observed good agreement between the two methods for kinetic variables (e.g. grand average bias of 4.71%, range 0.696 ± 0.540-8.26 ± 5.51%), and high inter-trial reliability (grand average standard error of measurement of 2.50% for FP and 2.36% for the SM).

Older and obese individuals are more susceptible to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in comparison with healthy, younger individuals. Manual material handling (MMH) is associated with the development of work-related MSDs. Although previous research has suggested that one-handed carrying is a particularly undesirable method of MMH, the effects of one-handed carrying on trunk kinetics and kinematics among older and/or obese people have not been adequately studied. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of age and obesity on trunk angles and moments during dominant side one-handed carrying of various load magnitudes. Twenty (20) participants divided into four groups with respect to age (young and older) and obesity (obese and non-obese) carried different loads (No-load [0 kg], Light [5.67 kg], and Heavy [10.21 kg]) in their dominant hand for approximately 6 m. Three-dimensional (3D) trunk angles and moments approximately about the L4/L5 vertebral segment were calculated using Visual3D. The findings indicated that while carrying a load in the dominant hand plays an important role in changing trunk kinematics and kinetics, the results were not dependent on age and/or obesity category. Absolute moments were greatest among participants in the obese groups; however, these moments were mitigated when normalized to body weight and height (%BW * Ht).

This therapy, however, is only in research stage and can benefit substantially from computational simulations to optimize the pattern of cement injection. Some studies have considered a patient-specific planning paradigm for Osteoporotic Hip Augmentation (OHA). Despite their biomechanical advantages, customized plans require advanced surgical systems for implementation. Other studies, therefore, have suggested a more generalized injection strategy. The goal of this study is to investigate as to whether the additional computational overhead of the patient-specific planning can significantly improve the bone strength as compared to the generalized injection strategies attempted in the literature. For this purpose, numerical models were developed from high resolution CT images (n = 4). Through finite element analysis and hydrodynamic simulations, we compared the biomechanical efficiency of the customized cement-based augmentation along with three generalized injection strategies developed previously. Two series of simulations were studied, one with homogeneous and one with inhomogeneous material properties for the osteoporotic bone. The customized cement-based augmentation inhomogeneous models showed that injection of only 10 ml of bone cement can significantly increase the yield load (79.6%, P < 0.01) and yield energy (199%, P < 0.01) of an osteoporotic femur.

However, this method approximates the peak pressure drop, and is unable to quantify the partial pressure recovery distal to the valve. As pressure drops are flow dependent, it remains difficult to assess the true significance of a stenosis for low-flow low-gradient patients. Recent advances in segmentation techniques enable patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of flow through the aortic valve. In this work a simulation framework is presented and used to analyze data of 18 patients. The ventricle and valve are reconstructed from 4D Computed Tomography imaging data. Ventricular motion is extracted from the medical images and used to model ventricular contraction and corresponding blood flow through the valve. Simplifications of the framework are assessed by introducing two simplified CFD models: a truncated time-dependent and a steady-state model. Model simplifications are justified for cases where the simulated pressure drop is above 10 mmHg. Furthermore, we propose a valve resistance index to quantify stenosis severity from simulation results. This index is compared to established metrics for clinical decision making, i.e. blood velocity and valve area. It is found that velocity measurements alone do not adequately reflect stenosis severity. This work demonstrates that combining 4D imaging data and CFD has the potential to provide a physiologically relevant diagnostic metric to quantify aortic valve stenosis severity.",True,Journal of biomechanics,False
