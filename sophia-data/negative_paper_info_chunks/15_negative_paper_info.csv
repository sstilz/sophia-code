Tb develops cycles of 1.6–7.3 days length within a 30–36 °C range, with no circadian component. We do not know the mechanism or function underlying behind the Tb cycles, although bears avoid Tb of <30 °C and shorter cycles are predicted from higher rates of heat loss in colder conditions. To test this we manipulated den temperatures (Tden) of 12 hibernating bears with body mass (BM) from 35.5 to 116.5 kg while recording Tb, metabolic rate (M), and shivering. Tb cycle length (0.8–11.2 days) shortened as Tden decreased (partial R2 = 0.490, p < 0.001). Large bears with low thermal conductance (TC) showed more variation in Tb cycle length with changes in Tden than did smaller bears with high TC. Minimum Tb across cycles was not consistent. At low Tden bears shivered both during rising and decreasing phases of Tb cycles, with minimum shivering during the fastest drop in Tb. At higher Tden the Tb pattern was more irregular. Mean M through Tb cycles was negatively correlated to Tden below lower critical temperatures (1.4–10.4 °C). Minimum M (0.3509 W/kg ± 0.0121 SE) during mid-hibernation scaled to BM [M (W) = 1.217 × BM (kg)0.6979, R2 = 0.855, p < 0.001]. Hibernating thermal conductance (TC) was negatively correlated to BM (R2 = 0.721, p < 0.001); bears with high TC had the same Tb cycle length as bears with low TC except at high Tden, thus not supporting the hypothesis that cooling rate alone determines Tb cycle length. We conclude that Tb cycling is effected by control of thermoregulatory heat production, and Tb cycling may not be present when hibernating bears use passive thermoregulation. More intense shivering in the rising phase of cycles may contribute to the prevention of muscle disuse atrophy. Bears hibernating in cold conditions use more energy during hibernation than in warmer conditions. At Tden below lower critical temperature, no extra energy expenditure results from Tb cycling compared to keeping a stable Tb.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

These inconstancies have prevented quantitative comparisons of the manner in which contractile activity engenders mixing of contained chyme. Recent quantitative work based on spatiotemporal mapping of intestinal contractions, macro- and micro-rheology, particle image velocimetry and real-time modelling has provided new insights into this process. Evidence indicates that the speeds and patterns of the various types of small intestinal contraction are insufficient to secure optimal mixing and enzymatic digestion over a minimal length of intestine. Hence particulate substrates and soluble nutrients become dispersed along the length of the lumen. Mixing within the lumen is not turbulent but results from localised folding and kneading of the contents by contractions but is augmented by the inconstant spatial disposition of the contractions and their component contractile processes. The latter include inconstancies in the sites of commencement and the directions of propagation of contraction in component groups of smooth muscle cells and in the coordination of the radial and circular components of smooth muscle contraction. Evidence suggests there is ongoing augmentation of mixing at the periphery of the lumen, during both the post-prandial and inter-meal periods, to promote flow around and between adjacent villi. This results largely from folding of the relatively inelastic mucosa during repeated radial and longitudinal muscular contraction, causing chyme to be displaced by periodic crowding and separation of the tips of the relatively rigid villi. Further, micro-rheological studies indicate that such peripheral mixing may extend to the apices of enterocytes owing to discontinuities in the mobile mucus layer that covers the ileal mucosa.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Nevertheless, many physiological studies make use of long-term captive birds, assuming the results will be applicable to wild populations. Here we investigated the effects of long-term captivity on a variety of physiological measurements in a relatively small (~12 g) southern African endemic bird, the Cape white-eye (Zosterops virens). Whole animal basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass (Mb) were influenced more by long-term captivity than by season, while mass-specific BMR, standard and basal whole animal and mass-specific evaporative water loss (EWL), and respiratory quotient (RQ), were all affected primarily by season, with long-term captivity having less of an effect. We therefore caution that whole animal BMR and Mb of long-term captive birds should not be used as representative of wild populations, and that the origin of study birds should be considered when comparing EWL and RQ of wild and long-term captive birds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This optomotor response is triggered by wide-field motion indicating a deviation from a desired flight path. We focus on the neuronal circuit that underlies this behavior in the blowfly Calliphora, studying the integration of optic flow in neck motor neurons that innervate muscles controlling head rotations. Frontal nerve motor neurons (FNMNs) have been described anatomically and recorded from extracellularly before. Here, we assign for the first time to five anatomical classes of FNMNs their visual motion tuning. We measured their responses to optic flow, as produced by rotations around particular body axes, recording intracellularly from single axons. Simultaneous injection of Neurobiotin allowed for the anatomical characterization of the recorded cells and revealed coupling patterns with neighboring neurons. The five FNMN classes can be divided into two groups that complement each other, regarding their preferred axes of rotation. The tuning matches the pulling planes of their innervated neck muscles, serving to rotate the head around its longitudinal axis. Anatomical and physiological findings demonstrate a synaptic connection between one FNMN and a well-described descending neuron, elucidating one important step from visual motion integration to neck motor output.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Nonetheless, the physiological mechanisms underlying feeding on carbohydrates by the Afrotropical malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae remain poorly understood. Here, we tested whether sugar sensitivity and sugar feeding preferences correlate with longevity in A.gambiae. We also tested whether feeding females on different sugar diets influences their biting behaviours. Electrophysiological recordings show that sugar neurones on the labella of females are most sensitive to sucrose, mixtures of glucose and fructose, and to melezitose; other sugars tested, including glucose and fructose presented alone, only weakly activate these taste neurones. Mosquitoes survive longest on sucrose, the most preferred sugar. Whereas feeding on a mixture of glucose and fructose is preferred over fructose or glucose alone, fructose supports higher longevity than either glucose or the mixture of the two hexoses. Females that had previously fed on glucose show a stronger biting response than those fed on sucrose, perhaps in an effort to compensate for their lower energetic state. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physiological basis of sugar feeding in A.gambiae and indicate how the sugar diet can affect laboratory-reared A.gambiae biting behaviours.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In the Rhône River Valley, populations of the crustacean Gammarus pulex are distributed along a 5 °C thermal gradient from the North to the South of the valley. In this present work, we investigated the heat shock response of G. pulex according to latitudinal distribution (northern vs. southern populations) and ontogeny (adults vs. embryos from early stages). We isolated two isoforms (one constitutive hsc70 and one inducible hsp70) of heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) and quantitatively compared their amounts of mRNA after heat shocks, using real-time PCR. Whereas the hsc70 (constitutive) gene did not vary between the two populations, a significant effect of the population was observed on the expression of the hsp70 (inducible) gene in adult specimens. The northern population of amphipods showed a greater magnitude of induction and a 2 °C lower onset temperature when compared to the southern population, suggesting that the northern population is more affected by elevated temperature than the southern one. We demonstrated that the expression of hsp70 may play a crucial role in the persistence of biogeographical patterns of G. pulex, since it reflects the natural distribution of this species along the latitudinal thermal gradient. A differential regulation of hsc70 gene was also observed according to the ontogenetic stage, with a switch from heat inducible in early life stages to constitutively and highly expressed in adults. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the entire life cycle to better understand the adaptive response to thermal stress.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A potential mechanism for increasing muscle and heart masses during migration in birds is the muscle growth inhibitor myostatin and its metalloproteinase activators, tolloid-like proteinases (TLL-1 and TLL-2). We hypothesized that myostatin, TLL-1 and TLL-2 are downregulated during migration in pectoralis and hearts of migratory passerines to promote hypertrophy. We measured seasonal variation of tissue masses, mRNA expression of myostatin, TLL-1, and TLL-2, and myostatin protein levels in pectoralis muscle and heart for yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus), and yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata). Pectoralis mass was greatest in spring for warbling vireos and yellow warblers, but was stable between spring and fall for yellow-rumped warblers. Heart mass was higher in spring than in fall for yellow-rumped warblers, lowest in fall for warbling vireos, and seasonally stable for yellow warblers. Pectoralis and heart mRNA expression of myostatin and the TLLs did not differ significantly for any of the three species, offering little support for our hypothesis for a prominent role for myostatin in regulating migration-induced variation in pectoralis and heart masses. In contrast, pectoralis myostatin protein levels were lowest in spring for all three species, consistent with our hypothesis. Myostatin protein levels in heart, however, were seasonally stable for warbling vireos and yellow warblers, and increased in spring relative to fall for yellow-rumped warblers. These data offer mixed support for our hypothesis for the pectoralis, but suggest that myostatin is not a prominent regulator of migration-induced heart hypertrophy. Moreover, the different seasonal patterns for pectoralis mRNA and protein expression suggest that post-transcriptional modification of myostatin may contribute to pectoralis mass regulation during migration.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, it is unclear if there are developmental periods, or critical windows, when oxygen use, survival and hatchling phenotypic characteristics are particularly influenced by changes in the thermal environment. Therefore, we examined the effects of constant incubation temperature and thermal shifts on survival, hatchling phenotype, and cost of development in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos. We incubated whitefish embryos at control temperatures of 2, 5, or 8 °C, and shifted embryos across these three temperatures at the end of gastrulation or organogenesis. We assessed hatch timing, mass at hatch, and yolk conversion efficiency (YCE). We determined cost of development, the amount of oxygen required to build a unit of mass, for the periods from fertilization–organogenesis, organogenesis–fin flutter, fin flutter–hatch, and for total development. An increase in incubation temperature decreased time to 50 % hatch (164 days at 2 °C, 104 days at 5 °C, and 63 days at 8 °C), survival decreased from 55 % at 2 °C, to 38 % at 5 °C, and 17 % at 8 °C, and hatchling yolk-free dry mass decreased from 1.27 mg at 2 °C to 0.61 mg at 8 °C. Thermal shifts altered time to 50 % hatch and hatchling yolk-free dry mass and revealed a critical window during gastrulation in which a temperature change reduced survival. YCE decreased and cost of development increased with increased incubation temperature, but embryos that hatched at 8 °C and were incubated at colder temperatures during fertilization–organogenesis had reduced cost. The relationship between cost of development and temperature was altered during fin flutter–hatch, indicating it may be a critical window during which temperature has the greatest impact on energetic processes. The increase in cost of development with an increase in temperature has not been documented in other fishes and suggests whitefish embryos are more energy efficient at colder temperatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Both species could survive low temperatures but the survival of S. lindsayae was greater than that of P. murrayi. Field soil temperatures in late spring—early summer indicated a minimum temperature of −19.5 °C and a maximum cooling rate of 0.71 °C min−1. In P. murrayi grown in culture, there was no significant effect of acclimation, nor of the two culture media used, on survival after freezing but survival was greater if freezing was seeded at –1 °C than at lower temperatures. The freezing survival ability of P. murrayi is much less than that of Panagrolaimus davidi CB1, another Antarctic nematode. Cryomicroscopy indicates that P. murrayi can survive low temperatures by either cryoprotective dehydration or freezing tolerance, but that freezing tolerance is the dominant strategy.

In a large room, actual pairs of bats exhibited greater disparity in peak frequency (PF), minimum frequency (FMIN) and call period compared to virtual pairs of bats, each flying alone. Greater inter-individual disparity in PF and FMIN may reduce acoustic interference and/or increase signal self-recognition in the presence of conspecifics. Bats flying alone in a smaller flight room, to simulate a more cluttered habitat as compared to the large flight room, produced calls of shorter duration and call period, lower intensity, and flew at lower speeds. In cluttered space, shorter call duration should reduce masking, while shorter call period equals more updates to the bat’s auditory scene. Lower intensity likely reflects reduced range detection requirements, reduced speed the demands of flying in clutter. Our results show that some changes (e.g. PF separation) are associated with conspecifics, others with closed habitat (e.g. reduced call intensity). However, we demonstrate that call duration, period, and flight speed appear similarly influenced by conspecifics and clutter. We suggest that some changes reduce conspecific interference and/or improve self-recognition, while others demonstrate that bats experience each other like clutter.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Marine invertebrates, such as lobsters and crabs, deal with a widely and wildly fluctuating temperature environment. Here, we describe the effects of changing temperature on the motor patterns generated by the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab, Cancer borealis. Over a broad range of “permissive” temperatures, the pyloric rhythm increases in frequency but maintains its characteristic phase relationships. Nonetheless, at more extreme high temperatures, the normal triphasic pyloric rhythm breaks down, or “crashes”. We present both experimental and computational approaches to understanding the stability of both single neurons and networks to temperature perturbations, and discuss data that shows that the “crash” temperatures themselves may be environmentally regulated. These approaches provide insight into how the nervous system can be stable to a global perturbation, such as temperature, in spite of the fact that all biological processes are temperature dependent.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Numerous species manifest a hibernation phenotype although the characteristics of the hypometabolic state can be quite different. Ground squirrels (e.g., Sciuridae) are often considered the prototypical hibernator as individuals in this genus transition from an active, euthermic state (37 °C) to a nonresponsive hibernating state where torpid body temperature commonly falls to 3–5 °C. However, the hibernating state is not continuous as periodic warming and arousals occur. In contrast, the larger hibernators of genus Ursus are less hypothermic (body temperatures decline from approximately 37°–33 °C), are more reactive, and cyclical arousals do not occur. Both species dramatically reduce cardiac output during hibernation from the active state (bears ~75 % reduction in bears and ~97 % reduction in ground squirrels), and both species demonstrate hypokinetic atrial chamber activity. However, there are several important differences in cardiac function between the two groups during hibernation. Left ventricular diastolic filling volumes and stroke volumes do not differ in bears between seasons, but increased diastolic and stroke volumes during hibernation are important contributors to cardiac output in ground squirrels. Decreased cardiac muscle mass and increased ventricular stiffness have been found in bears, whereas ground squirrels have increased cardiac muscle mass and decreased ventricular stiffness during hibernation. Molecular pathways of cardiac muscle plasticity reveal differences between the species in the modification of sarcomeric proteins such as titin and α myosin heavy chain during hibernation. The differences in hibernation character are likely to account for the alternative cardiac phenotypes and functional strategies manifested by the two species. Molecular investigation coupled with better knowledge of seasonal physiological alterations is dramatically advancing our understanding of small and large hibernators and their evolutionary differences.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

An eight-choice discrimination paradigm was used to determine the subjects’ sound localization abilities of five signal conditions covering a range of frequencies, durations, and levels. Subjects performed above the 12.5 % chance level for all broadband frequencies and were able to localize sounds over a large level range. Errors were typically located to either side of the signal source location when presented in the front 180° but were more dispersed when presented from locations behind the subject. Front-to-back confusions were few and accuracy was greater when signals originated from the front 180°. Head-related transfer functions were measured to determine if frequencies were filtered by the manatee body to create frequency-specific interaural level differences (ILDs). ILDs were found for all frequencies as a function of source location, although they were largest with frequencies above 18 kHz and when signals originated to either side of the subjects. Larger ILDs were found when the signals originated behind the subjects.

This study investigated the effects of thermal stress on physiological and biochemical parameters at five treatment temperatures resulting in minimal (25 °C), moderate (27, 29 °C) or severe (31, 33 °C) thermal stress in the common tropical freshwater crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. The aim was to develop a suite of stress-sensitive assays to use on threatened populations of freshwater crustaceans, particularly those restricted to cooler temperatures and only found in high altitude refugia. Significant increases in indicators of oxidative and metabolic stress were observed at 29 °C and were elevated further at 33 °C. After a 50-day acclimation to an imposed temperature stress, significant changes in the level of total glutathione, total lipids, muscular protein, total haemocyte count, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls were observed between treatments while superoxide dismutase activity and haemolymph protein concentrations did not change. The data provided proof of concept that measuring key biochemical responses to high temperature can provide a means of contrasting the level of thermal stress experienced between individuals of the same species adapted to different temperatures. The methods developed are expected to be of use in research on wild populations of other freshwater poikilothermic organisms, particularly those susceptible to increased environmental temperatures associated with climate change.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We compared O2-consumption and N excretion rates in vivo, and sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia transport characteristics of gut sac preparations in vitro. The Pacu had a significantly higher weight-specific oxygen consumption, and a lower N/Q ratio than the omnivorous Tambaqui, and a significantly lower urea-N excretion rate than the carnivorous black Piranha, suggesting N-limitation in the herbivorous Pacu. With a value of 2.62 ± 0.15, gut to fork length ratio in the Pacu was about 2.5 times higher than in the black Piranha, and 2.0 times higher than in the Tambaqui. Anterior intestinal activities of three enzymes involved in N-fixation for amino acid synthesis (glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate–oxaloacetate transferase, and glutamate–pyruvate transferase) were generally greatest in the carnivore and lowest in the herbivore species. In all three species, sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia were taken up at high rates from the intestine, resulting in an isosmotic fluid flux. Comparing the area-specific fluid flux of the anterior, mid, and posterior gut sections, no difference was detected between the three sections of the Pacu, while in the Tambaqui, it was highest in the anterior section, and in the black Piranha highest in the middle section. Overall, the area-specific uptake rates for sodium, chloride, glucose, and ammonia of anterior, mid, and posterior sections were similar in all three species, indicating that there is no difference in the area-specific transport rates associated with trophic position. The net ammonia uptake flux from gut interior was not significantly different from the net ammonia efflux to the serosal fluid, so that the ammonia removed from the intestine by the mucosal epithelium was quantitatively transferred through the tissue to the serosal side in all three species. Thus, metabolic activity of gut tissue did not significantly influence the net ammonia transfer. Due to the much higher gut to fork length ratio, the overall transport capacity of the gut of the herbivorous Pacu by far exceeded the transport capacity of their carnivorous and omnivorous relatives, thus compensating for the lower digestibility and the low Na+, Cl−, and N-content of the plant diet. Accordingly, in order to cope with the more difficult digestible plant material and the very low nitrogen content of plants, herbivorous fish have not evolved more effective area-specific transport capacities, but rather have increased the length of the gut.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In an earlier report we argued that these two thermoregulatory phenomena differ in several parameters. In the present study, we further complete this comparison by showing that metabolic rate patterns differ between both SDT and FIT. SDT bouts were significantly longer and deeper compared to FIT bouts. Additionally, respiratory quotient measures support the view that SDT is entered from a state of energetic balance while FIT appears to be an emergency shutdown of energy demanding thermogenesis due to a shortage of energy sources. In a second experiment, we also confirm that brief periods of food restriction during the hamsters’ torpor season increase the frequency of SDT, but do not affect its depth or duration. Although winter-acclimated animals could flexibly alter torpor frequency in order to stay in energetic balance, we also found evidence for torpor expression patterns that resembled FIT, rather than SDT. Consequently, if energetic challenges cannot be compensated with increased SDT expression any longer, the hamsters seem to be driven in a negative energy balance resulting in FIT as a last resort.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hypoxia retarded embryonic development, and reduced body size, locomotor performance and survival rate of hatchings at the critically high temperature. However, the effects of hypoxia were greatly reduced at the benign temperature.

Auditory organs are thus used to detect intraspecific communicative signals and environmental sounds relevant to survival. To hear, terrestrial animals must convert the acoustic energy contained in the airborne sound pressure waves into neural signals. In mammals, spectral quality is assessed by the decomposition of incoming sound waves into elementary frequency components using a sophisticated cochlear system. Some insects like katydids (or bushcrickets) have evolved biophysical mechanisms for auditory processing that are remarkably equivalent to those of mammals. Located on their front legs, katydid ears are small, yet are capable of performing several of the tasks usually associated with mammalian hearing. These tasks include air-to-liquid impedance conversion, signal amplification, and frequency analysis. Impedance conversion is achieved by a lever system, a mechanism functionally analogous to the mammalian middle ear ossicles, yet morphologically distinct. In katydids, the exact mechanisms supporting frequency analysis seem diverse, yet are seen to result in dispersive wave propagation phenomenologically similar to that of cochlear systems.

It first came to prominence when it was discovered that the vascular endothelium of mammals synthesises and releases nitric oxide (NO) to mediate a potent vasodilation. Subsequently, it was shown that NO is synthesised in the endothelium by a specific isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) called NOS3. Following this discovery, it was assumed that an endothelial NO/NOS3 system would be present in all vertebrate blood vessels. This review will discuss the latest genomic, anatomical and physiological evidence which demonstrates that an endothelial NO/NOS3 signalling is not ubiquitous in non-mammalian vertebrates, and that there have been key evolutionary steps that have led to the endothelial NO signalling system being a regulatory system found only in reptiles, birds and mammals. Furthermore, the emerging role of nitrite as an endocrine source of NO for vascular regulation is discussed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although numerous proteolytic pathways are known to participate in muscle disuse atrophy, recent evidence suggests that activation of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases (calpains) is required for disuse atrophy in limb skeletal muscles. In contrast to typical models of muscle disuse (humans and rodents), animals that experience natural bouts of chronic muscle inactivity, such as hibernating mammals and aestivating frogs, consistently exhibit limited or no change in skeletal muscle size. In the current study, we examined enzyme activity, protein abundance and gene expression levels of calpain isoforms in gastrocnemius muscle of the aestivating frog, Cyclorana alboguttata. We predicted that in aestivating C. alboguttata there would be a downregulation of the abundance, activity and gene expression of calpain 1 and calpain 2. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was no significant decrease in the enzyme activity levels or the relative protein abundances of calpain 1 and calpain 2. Similarly, gene expression assays (both qRT-PCR and RNA Seq data) indicated that calpains were unaffected by aestivation. Western blotting of ‘muscle-specific’ calpain 3, which is consistently downregulated during atrophic conditions, indicated that this isoform is present in C. alboguttata muscle where it appears to be in its autolysed state. The absence of any increase in enzyme activity, protein and mRNA abundance of calpains in aestivators is consistent with the protection of gastrocnemius muscle against uncontrolled proteolysis throughout aestivation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We recorded sound synchronized with high-speed video to investigate the hypothesis that blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus produce sounds by a slip–stick mechanism, previously described only in invertebrates. Blue catfish produce a variably paced series of sound pulses during abduction sweeps (pulsers) although some individuals (sliders) form longer duration sound units (slides) interspersed with pulses. Typical pulser sounds are evoked by short 1–2 ms movements with a rotation of 2°–3°. Jerks excite sounds that increase in amplitude after motion stops, suggesting constructive interference, which decays before the next jerk. Longer contact of the ridges produces a more steady-state sound in slides. Pulse pattern during stridulation is determined by pauses without movement: the spine moves during about 14 % of the abduction sweep in pulsers (~45 % in sliders) although movement appears continuous to the human eye. Spine rotation parameters do not predict pulse amplitude, but amplitude correlates with pause duration suggesting that force between the dorsal process and cleithrum increases with longer pauses. Sound production, stimulated by a series of rapid movements that set the pectoral girdle into resonance, is caused by a slip–stick mechanism.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The discovery of active amplification in two distinct insect lineages with independently evolved ears, suggests that the trait may be ancestral, and other insects may possess it as well.

We hypothesized that renal aquaporin expression and localization are functionally regulated in response to seawater and during smoltification in Atlantic salmon and thus reflect a shift in renal function from filtration towards secretion. We localized aquaporins (Aqp) in Atlantic salmon renal tubular segments by immunohistochemistry and monitored their expressional dynamics using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Three aquaporins: Aqpa1aa, Aqp1ab and Aqp8b and two aquaglyceroporins Aqp3a and Aqp10b were localized in the kidney of salmon. The staining for all aquaporins was most abundant in the proximal kidney tubules and there was no clear effect of salinity or developmental stage on localization pattern. Aqp1aa and Aqp3a were abundant apically but extended throughout the epithelial cells. Aqp10b was expressed apically and along the lateral membrane. Aqp8b was mainly basolateral and Aqp1ab was located in sub-apical intracellular compartments. mRNAs of aqp8b and aqp10b were higher in FW smolts compared to FW parr, whereas the opposite was true for aqp1aa. Aqp mRNA levels changed in response to both SW and sham transfer. Protein levels, however, were stable for most paralogs. In conclusion, aquaporins are abundant in salmon proximal renal tubules and may participate in water secretion and thus urine modification as suggested for other vertebrates. Further studies should seek to couple functional measurements of single nephrons to expression and localization of Aqps in the salmonid kidney.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We have reported that functional neurons exist in the accessory lobe. As there is histological evidence that synaptic terminals of cholinergic nerves exist near the somata of accessory lobe neurons, we examined the effects of acetylcholine on changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), as an index of cellular activities. Acetylcholine (0.1–100 µM) caused a transient rise in the [Ca2+]i. Acetylcholine-evoked [Ca2+]i rises were observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and they were abolished in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase of intracellular Ca2+ stores or atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. mRNAs coding M3 and M5 isoforms of the muscarinic receptors were detected in accessory lobes by the RT-PCR. These results indicate that chick accessory lobe neurons express functional muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and that acetylcholine stimulates Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores, which elevates the [Ca2+]i in the somata of accessory lobe neurons, through activation of these receptors. Cholinergic synaptic transmission to the accessory lobe neurons may regulate some cellular functions through muscarinic receptors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Just prior to metamorphosis, an adult retina and associated neuro-processing structures emerge adjacent to the existing material in the larval compound eye. Depending on the species, the duration of this double-retina eye can range from a few hours to several days. Although this developmental process occurs in all stomatopod species observed to date, the retinal physiology and extent to which each retina contributes to the animal’s visual sensitivity during this transition phase is unknown. We investigated the visual physiology of stomatopod double retinas using microspectrophotometry and electroretinogram recordings from different developmental stages of the Western Atlantic species Squilla empusa. Though microspectrophotometry data were inconclusive, we found robust ERG responses in both larval and adult retinas at all sampled time points indicating that the adult retina responds to light from the very onset of its emergence. We also found evidence of an increase in the response dynamics with ontogeny as well as an increase in sensitivity of retinal tissue during the double-retina phase relative to single retinas.

These fluxes were measured by adding varying concentrations of 14C-sucrose to the perfusate and monitoring their appearance in the bathing solution. Transepithelial 14C-sucrose transport was the combination of a hyperbolic function of luminal concentration, following Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and apparent diffusion. The kinetic constants of the putative sucrose transporter were KM = 20.50 ± 6.00 µM and Jmax = 1.81 ± 0.50 pmol/cm2 × min. Phloridzin, an inhibitor of Na+-dependent mucosal glucose transport, decreased MS 14C-sucrose transport. Decreased MS 14C-sucrose transport also occurred in the presence of luminal trehalose, a disaccharide containing d-glucose moieties. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) identified the chemical nature of radioactively labeled sugars in the bath following transepithelial transport. TLC revealed 14C-sucrose was transported across the intestine largely intact with no 14C-glucose or 14C-fructose appearing in the serosal bath or luminal perfusate.

As Regen’s experiment with field crickets already indicates, hearing research has strongly benefited from the fact that many species of insects respond so reliably to acoustic playbacks, and that they do so under very different experimental paradigms, from open-loop laboratory conditions on a trackball to the disturbed and noisy conditions in the field. Moreover, with the advent of neurophysiological techniques hearing and sound communication in insects has become one of the classical areas in neuroethology, aiming to understand the proximate mechanisms of behavior in signalers and receivers (Huber et al. 1989; Gerhardt and Huber 2002; Greenfield 2002; Hedwig 2013). Finally, the refinement of methods such as scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry for measuring sound-induced vibrations down to the nanometer range has greatly improved our understanding of the biophysics of hearing in recent years. This issue of JCP-A presents a synopsis of what is currently known about insect hearing. Its title, Insect hearing: from physics to ecology, reflects its broad thematic scope. We have to keep in mind that natural selection may act on virtually all aspects of hearing, from molecules associated with the transduction and amplification process in receptor cells, to sound guides that provide directionality in the small insect receivers, or to the complex behavior in large choruses of singing insects. The contributions to this issue are guided by four basic themes: (1) ears and receptor mechanisms, (2) pattern recognition and directional hearing, (3) ecology of sound communication, and (4) evolution. Since the first recordings from locust auditory receptor neurons it was established that locusts’ ears are, in principle, able to discriminate different frequencies. However, the biophysical and or physiological basis of this capacity Almost exactly 100 years ago, Johann Regen performed an ingenious simple experiment where he arranged a male cricket calling in one room and transmitted its song via telephone to another room. There a female could be attracted to the earpiece of a second telephone (Regen 1913). Given the poor frequency characteristics of the early (and contemporary) telephones, one could already speculate about the nature of (temporal) cues that guided the female s phonotactic approach. In the meantime a tremendous progress has been made regarding our understanding of insect hearing (Gerhardt and Huber 2002; Hedwig 2013). This is partly due to the bewildering variety of insect ears having evolved independently many times, and virtually anywhere on the insect body such as on the tibia, abdomen, thorax, wing, mouthparts or the base of the neck (reviews: Hoy and Robert 1996; Yack 2004; Straus and Stumpner 2015). Insect hearing organs exist as two basic forms: (1) either as tympanal ears with a thin cuticular membrane, an air-filled cavity behind it and a chordotonal organ directly or indirectly coupled mechanically to the tympanum (Robert and Hoy 1998)—these ears respond to sound pressure changes; or (2) as nontympanal hearing organs which respond to the air particle velocity. These are represented by filiform hairs or antennae, such as those in mosquitoes or fruit flies.

Like mammals, the ears of insects, such as those of Drosophila melanogaster, mechanically amplify sound stimuli and have also been reported to express Prestin homologs. To determine whether the D. melanogaster Prestin homolog (dpres) is required for auditory amplification, we generated and analyzed dpres mutant flies. We found that dpres is robustly expressed in the fly’s antennal ear. However, dpres mutant flies show normal auditory nerve responses, and intact non-linear amplification. Thus we conclude that, in D. melanogaster, auditory amplification is independent of Prestin. This finding resonates with prior phylogenetic analyses, which suggest that the derived motor function of mammalian Prestin replaced, or amended, an ancestral transport function. Indeed, we show that dpres encodes a functional anion transporter. Interestingly, the acquired new motor function in the phylogenetic lineage leading to birds and mammals coincides with loss of the mechanotransducer channel NompC (=TRPN1), which has been shown to be required for auditory amplification in flies. The advent of Prestin (or loss of NompC, respectively) may thus mark an evolutionary transition from a transducer-based to a Prestin-based mechanism of auditory amplification.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Consequently, these organs should become more sensitive to changes in body temperature. Yet, organs at the periphery of the body still experience considerable fluctuations in temperature, which could select for lower thermal sensitivity. We hypothesised that the performance of soleus muscle taken from the leg would depend less on temperature than would the performance of diaphragm muscle taken from the body core. Soleus and diaphragm muscles were isolated from mice and subjected to isometric and work-loop studies to analyse mechanical performance at temperatures between 15 and 40 °C. Across this thermal range, soleus muscle took longer to generate isometric force and longer to relax, and tended to produce greater normalised maximal force (stress) than did diaphragm muscle. The time required to produce half of maximal force during isometric tetanus and the time required to relax half of maximal force were both more sensitive to temperature in soleus than they were in diaphragm. However, thermal sensitivities of maximal force during isometric tetani were similar for both muscles. Consistent with our hypothesis, power output (the product of speed and force) was greater in magnitude and more thermally sensitive in diaphragm than it was in soleus. Our findings, when combined with previous observations of muscles from regionally endothermic fish, suggest that endothermy influences the thermal sensitivities of power output in core and peripheral muscles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Mitochondrial decay is generally associated with impairment in the organelle bioenergetics function and increased oxidative stress, and it appears that deterioration of mitochondrial inner membrane phospholipids (PL), particularly cardiolipin (CL), and accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are among the main mechanisms involved in this process. In the present study, liver mitochondrial membrane PL compositions, lipid peroxidation, and mtDNA gene expression were analyzed in rainbow trout fed three diets with the same base formulation but with lipid supplied either by fish oil (FO), rapeseed oil (RO), or high DHA oil (DHA) during 6 weeks. Specifically, two feeding trials were performed using fish from the same population of two ages (1 and 3 years), and PL class compositions of liver mitochondria, fatty acid composition of individual PL classes, TBARS content, and mtDNA expression were determined. Dietary fatty acid composition strongly affected mitochondrial membrane composition from trout liver but observed changes did not fully reflect the diet, particularly when it contained high DHA. The changes were PL specific, CL being particularly resistant to changes in DHA. Some significant differences observed in expression of mtDNA with diet may suggest long-term dietary effects in mitochondrial gene expression which could affect electron transport chain function. All the changes were influenced by fish age, which could be related to the different growth rates observed between 1- and 3-year-old trout but that could also indicate age-related changes in the ability to maintain structural homeostasis of mitochondrial membranes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

These hairs deflect each other when the joint flexes during locomotion, reversibly interlocking by microtrichs on their hair shafts. The torque resisting the hair deflection into the direction of natural stimulation is smaller by up to two powers of ten than that for the other directions. The torsional restoring constant S of the hair suspension is about 10−10 Nm rad−1 in the preferred direction, up to a hair deflection angle of 30° (mean of natural deflection angles). Joint movements were imposed in ranges and at rates measured in walking spiders and sensory action potentials recorded.

These consisted of compensatory movements, both vestibular and visual, to prevent image motion, and saccades to relocate gaze. All vertebrates fixate food items with their heads to enable ingestion, but from teleosts onwards some species also use eye movements to target particular objects, especially food. Eye movement use is related to the resolution distribution in the retina, with eyes that contain foveas, or areas of high ganglion cell density, being more likely to make targeting eye movements, not seen in animals with more uniform retinas. Birds, in particular, tend mainly to use head movements when shifting gaze. Many birds also make translatory head saccades (head bobbing) when walking. It is common for animals to use both eyes when locating food items ahead, but the use of binocular disparity for distance judgment is rare, and has only been demonstrated in toads, owls, cats and primates. Smooth tracking with eyes alone is probably confined to primates.

We define individual-level choosiness as the change in mating propensity in response to different stimulus signals. We illustrate general issues in estimating aspects of preference functions and discuss experimental setups for quantifying variation in choosiness with a focus on choices based on acoustic signals in insects. One important consideration is whether preferences are measured sequentially one stimulus at a time or in competitive multiple-choice setups; the suitability of these alternatives depends on the ecology of the study species. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of behavioural proxies for determining preference functions, which can be misleading if the proxies are not linearly related to mating propensity. Finally, we address statistical approaches, including the use of function-valued trait analysis, for studying choosiness.

Tissue metabolic capacity derived from enzyme measurements, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), as well as lactate dehydrogenase. Cellular stress and signaling responses were identified from expression patterns of Hsp70 and Hsp90, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNKs and ERKs, from protein ubiquitylation and finally from the levels of transcription factor Hif-1α as an indicator of systemic hypoxemia. Exposure to elevated CO2 levels at temperatures higher than 24 °C generally caused an increase in fish mortality above the rate caused by warming alone, indicating effects of the two factors and a failure of acclimation and thus the limits of phenotypic plasticity to be reached. As a potential reason, tissue-dependent induction and stabilization of Hif-1α indicate hypoxemic conditions. Their exacerbation by enhanced CO2 levels is linked to the persistent expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, oxidative stress and activation of MAPK and ubiquitin pathways. Antioxidant defence is enhanced by expression of catalase and glutathione reductase, however, leaving superoxide dismutase suppressed by elevated CO2 levels. On longer timescales in specimens surviving warming and CO2 exposures, various metabolic adjustments initiate a preference to oxidize lipid via HOAD for energy supply. These processes indicate significant acclimation up to a limit and a time-limited capacity to survive extreme conditions passively by exploiting mechanisms of cellular resilience.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the simplest and most effective non-invasive method to assess the electrical activity of the heart and to obtain information on the heart rate (HR) and rhythm. Because information on the HR of very small reptiles (body mass <10 g) is still scarce in the literature, in the present work we describe a procedure for recording the ECG in non-anesthetized geckos (Hemidactylus mabouia, Moreau de Jonnès, 1818) under different conditions, namely manual restraint (MR), spontaneous tonic immobility (TI), and in the non-restrained condition (NR). In the gecko ECG, the P, QRS and T waves were clearly distinguishable. The HR was 2.83 ± 0.02 Hz under MR, which was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than the HR under the TI (1.65 ± 0.09 Hz) and NR (1.60 ± 0.10 Hz) conditions. Spontaneously beating isolated gecko hearts contracted at 0.84 ± 0.03 Hz. The in vitro beating rate was affected in a concentration-dependent fashion by adrenoceptor stimulation with noradrenaline, as well as by the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol, which produced significant positive and negative chronotropic effects, respectively (p < 0.001). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the ECG morphology and HR values in geckos, particularly under TI.

the GH/IGF-I axis in osmotic acclimation of the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata, juvenile specimens were acclimated to four environmental salinities: hyposmotic (5 ‰), isosmotic (12 ‰) and hyperosmotic (40 and 55 ‰). The full-length cDNAs for both pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) and prepro-somatostatin-I (PSS-I), the precursor for mature somatostatin-I (SS-I), were cloned. Hypothalamic PACAP and PSS-I, hypophyseal growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL), and hepatic insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA expression levels were analyzed in the four rearing salinities tested. PACAP and IGF-I mRNA values increased significantly in response to both 5 and 55 ‰ salinities, showing a U-shaped curve relationship with the basal level in the 40 ‰ group. Hypothalamic PSS-I expression increased strongly in the 55 ‰ environment. GH mRNA levels did not change in any of the tested environmental salinities. PRL mRNA maximum levels were encountered in the 5 and 12 ‰ environments, but significantly down-regulated in the 40 ‰. Plasma cortisol levels significantly increased in the 40 ‰ environment. These results are discussed in relation to the well-known high adaptability of Sparus aurata to different environmental salinities and the role of the GH/IGF-I axis in this process.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Many temperate ectotherms undergo thermal acclimation to remain functional over a wide range of body temperatures, but few studies have investigated whether populations of a single species have evolved differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance. Therefore, we asked whether the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance has diverged between northern and southern populations of eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens). We acclimated eastern newts from Florida and Maine to cold (6 °C) or warm (28 °C) conditions for 12 weeks. Following acclimation, we measured the burst speed of newts at 6, 11.5, 17, 22.5, 28, and 33.5 °C. We also measured the activities of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in skeletal muscle of newts. The newts from Maine were better able to acclimate to low temperature compared to newts from Florida. Regardless of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity of burst speed was higher in the Florida compared to the Maine population. In general, newts from Maine performed better at low temperatures, whereas newts from Florida performed better at high temperatures. The activities of CK and LDH were lower in cold compared to warm-acclimated newts in the Florida population, but acclimation did not affect the activities of these enzymes in the Maine population. The activities of CK and LDH do not explain differences in the thermal plasticity of locomotor performance between populations. Our results demonstrate that the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of locomotor performance differ between northern and southern populations of eastern newts, suggesting that these traits readily adapt to the thermal environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

As a consequence, a striking diversity exists in the location, construction and behavioural implementation of ears. In this review, we first summarise what is known about the evolutionary origin of ears and the presumed precursor organs in the various insect groups. Thereafter, we focus on selective forces for making and keeping an ear: we discuss detecting and localising predators and conspecifics, including establishing new “private” channels for intraspecific communication. More advanced aspects involve judging the distance of conspecifics, or assessing individual quality from songs which makes auditory processing a means for exerting sexual selection on mating partners. We try to identify negative selective forces, mainly in the context of energy expenditure for developing and keeping an ear, but also in conjunction with acoustic communication, which incorporates risks like eavesdropping by predators and parasitoids. We then discuss balancing pressures, which might oppose optimising an ear for a specific task (when it serves different functions, for example). Subsequently, we describe various scenarios that might have led to a reduction or complete loss of ears in evolution. Finally, we describe cases of sex differences in ears and potential reasons for their appearance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Under dark conditions, Xenopus tadpoles move downstream at the onset of current flow, then turn, and orient toward the direction of the flow with high accuracy. Postmetamorphic froglets also exhibit positive rheotaxis but with less accuracy and longer latency. The addition of discrete light cues to an otherwise dark environment disrupts rheotaxis and positioning. Orientation is less accurate, latency to orient is longer, and animals do not move as far downstream in the presence of light. Compared with untreated tadpoles tested in the dark, tadpoles exposed to gentamicin show less accurate rheotaxis with longer latency and do not move as far downstream in response to flow. These effects are compounded by the presence of light cues. The disruptive effects of light on flow sensing in Xenopus emphasize the disturbances to natural behaviors that may be produced by anthropogenic illumination in nocturnal habitats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Large-scale modeling efforts directed at predicting the energetic impact of changing sea ice conditions on polar ecosystems require a better understanding of thermoregulation in air of free-ranging animals. We utilized infrared imaging as an indirect approach to determine surface temperatures of dry, hauled-out Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, n = 35) of varying age and body condition during the Antarctic summer. The study groups provided a fivefold range in body mass and a threefold range in blubber depth. Surface temperature (Ts) did not vary by body region (head, shoulder, axilla, torso, hip, flippers). Average seal Ts (mean 13.9 ± 11.2 °C) was best described through a combination of the physical traits of body mass and environmental variables of ambient temperature Tair, and wind speed. Additional factors of ice temperature (Tice), relative humidity and cloud cover did not improve the model.

Heat loss by radiation was primarily influenced by body mass and wind speed, whereas convective heat loss was influenced primarily by blubber depth and wind speed.

To test the hypothesis that the stress-induced CORT (SI-CORT) response is repeatable over the adult life span of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), we sampled 32 male and 25 female free-living scrub-jays (aged 2–13 years) during a 9-year period (2004–2012). Each individual was sampled two to five times and samples were collected one or more years apart during the pre-breeding season (Jan–March). In addition, individuals sampled over the greatest time period (6–8 years) were analyzed separately to more closely assess long-term repeatability. SI-CORT was repeatable in females, but not males, when values were not corrected for confounding variables (agreement repeatability). However, when the year and time of day of sample collection were controlled (adjusted repeatability), SI-CORT was repeatable in both sexes. SI-CORT was also repeatable in the males and females sampled 6–8 years apart. Finally, baseline CORT levels of males, but not females, exhibited low but significant repeatability when adjusted for year. The results of this study demonstrate that differences in SI-CORT levels were repeatable within adult scrub-jays sampled up to 8 years apart. Further, the female SI-CORT response was more consistent between pre-breeding seasons than males, which may have resulted from males having higher SI-CORT plasticity in response to environmental conditions.

Three adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolutionary origin or maintenance of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs), which may have evolved to reduce respiratory water loss, facilitate gas exchange in high CO2 and low O2 micro-environments, or to ameliorate potential damage as a result of oversupply of O2. None of these hypotheses have unequivocal support, and several non-adaptive hypotheses have also been proposed. In the present study, we reared cockroaches Nauphoeta cinerea in selected levels of O2 throughout development, and examined how this affected growth rate, tracheal morphology and patterns of gas exchange. O2 level in the rearing environment caused significant changes in tracheal morphology and the exhibition of DGCs, but the direction of these effects was inconsistent with all three adaptive hypotheses: water loss was not associated with DGC length, cockroaches grew fastest in hyperoxia, and DGCs exhibited by cockroaches reared in normoxia were shorter than those exhibited by cockroaches reared in hypoxia or hyperoxia.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The receptor expression was noted every 4 h interval over 24 h under natural light–dark cycle, during two seasons and was correlated with peripheral level of melatonin. The MT1/MT2 receptor expression displayed higher levels at the time of dusk (light–dark transition; 1800 hours), while plasma melatonin was still low compared to the preceding time point. The receptors were downregulated during the nighttime with a minimum expression at 0200 hours. Thymus, during the long day length, showed a tissue-specific pattern of receptor expression with a minimum expression at 0600 hours. Results suggest that photoperiod by modulation of melatonin level inversely regulates the receptor expression. The observations imply that there exists a temporal window of sensitivity in the target organs to the melatonin signal that is regulated by modulation of melatonin receptor expression which might be involved in mediating the photoperiodic effects of melatonin in the control of seasonal immune physiology.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here we review and compare functional adaptations in both groups of parasitoids, Ormiini and Emblemasomatini. Tympanal organs in both groups originate from a common precursor organ and are somewhat similar in morphology and physiology. In terms of functional adaptations, the hearing thresholds are largely adapted to the frequency spectra of the calling song of the hosts. The large host ranges of some parasitoids indicate that their neuronal filter for the temporal patterns of the calling songs are broader than those found in intraspecific communication. For host localization the night active Ormia ochracea and the day active E. auditrix are able to locate a sound source precisely in space. For phonotaxis flight and walking phases are used, whereby O. ochracea approaches hosts during flight while E. auditrix employs intermediate landings and re-orientation, apparently separating azimuthal and vertical angles. The consequences of the parasitoid pressure are discussed for signal evolution and intraspecific communication of the host species. This natural selection pressure might have led to different avoidance strategies in the hosts: silent males in crickets, shorter signals in tettigoniids and fluctuating population abundances in cicadas.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we review peripheral preprocessing along four computational themes rather than discussing specific physiological mechanisms: (1) control of sensitivity by adaptation, (2) recoding of amplitude modulations of an acoustic signal into a labeled-line code (3) frequency processing and (4) conditioning for binaural processing. Along these lines, we review evidence for canonical computations carried out in the peripheral auditory pathway and show that despite the vast diversity of insect hearing, signal processing is governed by common computational motifs and principles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Acoustic signals are not only subjected to changes imposed by the physical structure of the habitat such as attenuation and degradation but also to masking interference from co-occurring signals of other acoustically communicating species. Masking interference is likely to be a ubiquitous problem in multi-species assemblages, but successful communication in natural environments under noisy conditions suggests powerful strategies to deal with the detection and recognition of relevant signals. In this review we present recent work on the role of the habitat as a driving force in shaping insect signal structures. In the context of acoustic masking interference, we discuss the ecological niche concept and examine the role of acoustic resource partitioning in the temporal, spatial and spectral domains as sender strategies to counter masking. We then examine the efficacy of different receiver strategies: physiological mechanisms such as frequency tuning, spatial release from masking and gain control as useful strategies to counteract acoustic masking.

This represents a gain in striking behavior by avoiding responses to random incidents. However, the first stimulus is also expected to change the threshold for perceiving the subsequent second sound, thus possibly introducing some costs. We mimicked this situation in a behavioral double-stimulus paradigm utilizing saccadic head turns of owls. The first stimulus served as an adapter, was presented in frontal space, and did not elicit a head turn. The second stimulus, emitted from a peripheral source, elicited the head turn. The time interval between both stimuli was varied. Data obtained with double stimulation were compared with data collected with a single stimulus from the same positions as the second stimulus in the double-stimulus paradigm. Sound-localization performance was quantified by the response latency, accuracy, and precision of the head turns. Response latency was increased with double stimuli, while accuracy and precision were decreased. The effect depended on the inter-stimulus interval. These results suggest that waiting for a second stimulus may indeed impose costs on sound localization by adaptation and this reduces the gain obtained by waiting for a second stimulus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study aimed to clone and sequence the Na+:K+:2Cl−cotransporter1 (nkcc1) from the gills of P. schlosseri, and to determine the effects of ammonia exposure on its mRNA expression and protein abundance after pre-acclimation to slightly brackish water (salinity 3; SBW) for 2 weeks. The complete coding cDNA sequences of nkcc1a consisted of 3453 bp, coding for 1151 amino acid with an estimated molecular mass of 125.4 kDa. Exposure to 75 mmol l−1 NH4Cl in SBW had no effect on the mRNA expression of nkcc1a. However, western blotting revealed a significant increase in the protein abundance of multiple T4-immunoreactive bands of molecular mass 170–250 kDa in the gills of P. schlosseri exposed to ammonia. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of the increased T4-immunoreactive protein with Na+/K+-ATPase (Nka) α-subunit to the basolateral membrane of certain ionocytes in the gills of the ammonia-exposed fish. As Nkcc1 is known to have a basolateral localization, it can be concluded that ammonia exposure led to an increase in the expression of glycosylated Nkcc1, the molecular masses of which were reduced upon enzymatic deglycosylation, in the gills of P. schlosseri. The dependency on post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of branchial Nkcc1 in P. schlosseri would facilitate prompt responses to changes in environmental condition. As NH4+ can replace K+, NH4+ could probably enter ionocytes through the basolateral Nkcc1a during active ammonia excretion, but increased influx of Na+, NH4+ and 2Cl− would alter the transmembrane Na+ gradient. Consequently, exposure of P. schlosseri to ammonia would also result in an increase in branchial activity of Nka with decreased NH4+ affinity so as to maintain intracellular Na+ and K+ homeostasis as reported elsewhere.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, there has been no evidence demonstrating that this behavior is actually based on negative phototropotaxis. In this study, we showed that the slugs do not exhibit the circling behavior in the absence of light, and that amputation of the cerebral commissure also diminishes the circling behavior under light. We could detect light-evoked responses during electrical recording from the cut edge of the cerebral commissure. Labeling of the optic nerve with neurobiotin also revealed the presence of the commissural fibers that potentially transmit the light information to the contralateral cerebral ganglion.

Primate trichromatic vision arose from the duplication and divergence of an X-linked opsin gene, and is long attributed to tandem shifts from nocturnality to diurnality and from insectivory to frugivory. Opsin gene variation and at least one duplication event exist in the order Chiroptera, suggesting that trichromatic vision could evolve under favorable ecological conditions. The natural history of the Samoan flying fox (Pteropus samoensis) meets these conditions—it is a large bat that consumes nectar and fruit and demonstrates strong diurnal proclivities. It also possesses a visual system that is strikingly similar to that of primates. To explore the potential for opsin gene duplication and divergence in this species, we sequenced the opsin genes of 11 individuals (19 X-chromosomes) from three South Pacific islands. Our results indicate the uniform presence of two opsins with predicted peak sensitivities of ca. 360 and 553 nm.

Within this study the whole animal O2 consumption rate of a common New Zealand intertidal triplefin fish, Forsterygion lapillum, was investigated at different acclimation temperatures (15, 18, 21, 24 or 25 °C) as a commonly used indicator of metabolic performance. In addition, the mitochondria within permeabilised skeletal muscle fibres of fish acclimated to a moderate temperature (18 °C Cool acclimation group—CA) and a warm temperature (24 °C. Warm acclimation group—WA) were also tested at 18, 24 and 25 °C in different states of coupling and with different substrates. These two levels of analysis were carried out to test whether any peak in whole animal metabolism reflected the respiratory performance of mitochondria from skeletal muscle representing the bulk of metabolic tissue. While standard metabolic rate (SMR- an indicator of total maintenance metabolism) and maximal metabolic rate ($$\dot{M}$$M˙O2max) both generally increased with temperature, aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) was maximal at 24 °C, giving the impression that whole animal (metabolic) performance was optimised at a surprisingly high temperature. Mitochondrial oxygen flux also increased with increasing assay temperature but WA fish showed a lowered response to temperature in high flux states, such as those of oxidative phosphorylation and in chemically uncoupled states of respiration. The thermal stability of mitochondria from WA fish was also noticeably greater than CA fish at 25 °C. However, the predicted contribution of respirational flux to ATP synthesis remained the same in both groups and WA fish showed higher anaerobic activity as a result of high muscle lactate loads in both rested and exhausted states.

As a counter-measure against the severe predation pressure many nocturnal insects have evolved ears sensitive to ultrasonic bat calls. In moths bat-detection was the principal purpose of hearing, as evidenced by comparable hearing physiology with best sensitivity in the bat echolocation range, 20–60 kHz, across moths in spite of diverse ear morphology. Some eared moths subsequently developed sound-producing organs to warn/startle/jam attacking bats and/or to communicate intraspecifically with sound. Not only the sounds for interaction with bats, but also mating signals are within the frequency range where bats echolocate, indicating that sound communication developed after hearing by “sensory exploitation”. Recent findings on moth sound communication reveal that close-range (~ a few cm) communication with low-intensity ultrasounds “whispered” by males during courtship is not uncommon, contrary to the general notion of moths predominantly being silent. Sexual sound communication in moths may apply to many eared moths, perhaps even a majority. The low intensities and high frequencies explain that this was overlooked, revealing a bias towards what humans can sense, when studying (acoustic) communication in animals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The question arises: how does this peculiar visual system function? A series of experiments suggests that their principal eyes (E1 and E2) are highly specialized for hunting. These eyes are tubular and have relatively long focal lengths leading to high image magnification. Their retinae are linear, and are divided into distinct green-sensitive distal and UV and polarization-sensitive proximal portions. Each distal retina, moreover, has many tiers of photoreceptors with rhabdomeres the long axis of which are peculiarly oriented perpendicular to the light path. Based on detailed optical investigations, the lenses of these eyes are bifocal and project focused images onto specific retinal tiers. Behavioral experiments suggest that these larvae approach prey within their eyes’ near-fields, and that they can correctly gauge prey distances even when conventional distance-vision mechanisms are unavailable. In the near-field of these eyes object distance determines which of the many retinal layers receive the best-focused images. This retinal organization could facilitate an unusual distance-vision mechanism. We here summarize past findings and discuss how these eyes allow Thermonectus larvae to be such successful predators.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Unidirectional and net fluxes of dipeptide across the tissue and luminal factors affecting their magnitude and direction were characterized by perfusing the lumen with the dipeptide and measuring its appearance in saline on the serosal side of the organ. Transmural transport of 10 mM Gly-Sar resulted in serosal accumulation of only the dipeptide; no appearance of corresponding monomeric amino acids glycine or sarcosine was observed. Carrier-mediated and diffusional transmural intestinal transport of Gly-Sar was estimated at 1–15 mM luminal concentrations and followed a curvilinear equation providing a Km = 0.44 ± 0.17 mM, a Jmax = 1.27 ± 0.12 nmol cm−2 min−1, and a diffusional coefficient = 0.026 ± 0.008 nmol cm−2 min−1 mM−1.

Alkaline (pH 8.5) luminal pH more than doubled transmural Gly-Sar transport as compared to acidic (pH 5.5) luminal pH, while luminal amino acid-metal chelates (e.g., Leu-Zn-Leu), and high concentrations of amino acids alone significantly (p < 0.001) reduced intestinal Gly-Sar transfer by inhibiting carrier transport of the dipeptide.

They differ considerably in the organization of their auditory pathways, and the complexity of their songs, which are essential for mate attraction. Recent approaches aimed at describing the behavioral preference functions of females in both taxa by a simple modeling framework. The basic structure of the model consists of three processing steps: (1) feature extraction with a bank of ‘LN models’—each containing a linear filter followed by a nonlinearity, (2) temporal integration, and (3) linear combination. The specific properties of the filters and nonlinearities were determined using a genetic learning algorithm trained on a large set of different song features and the corresponding behavioral response scores. The model showed an excellent prediction of the behavioral responses to the tested songs. Most remarkably, in both taxa the genetic algorithm found Gabor-like functions as the optimal filter shapes. By slight modifications of Gabor filters several types of preference functions could be modeled, which are observed in different cricket species. Furthermore, this model was able to explain several so far enigmatic results in grasshoppers. The computational approach offered a remarkably simple framework that can account for phenotypically rather different preference functions across several taxa.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Aerial hearing thresholds were also measured in the presence of octave-band masking noise centered at eight signal frequencies (0.25–22.6 kHz) so that critical ratios could be determined. The aerial audiogram of the sea otter resembled that of sea lions and showed a reduction in low-frequency sensitivity relative to terrestrial mustelids. Best sensitivity was −1 dB re 20 µPa at 8 kHz. Under water, hearing sensitivity was significantly reduced when compared to sea lions and other pinniped species, demonstrating that sea otter hearing is primarily adapted to receive airborne sounds.

Motor skill learning is essential for environmental adaptations during everyday life. It has been shown that the cerebellum plays an important role in both the adaptation of eye movements and the motor skill learning. However, the neuronal substrates responsible for consolidation of complex motor skills rather than simple reflexes are still uncertain. Because the induction of immediate-early genes activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) and zinc finger binding protein clone 268 (Zif268) has been regarded as a marker for recent neuronal activity, therefore, in the present study, a rat paradigm of motor skill learning was used to investigate the protein expression of Arc and zif268 in the cerebellum after motor skill learning. Rats were trained to traverse the runway apparatus for 5 days. Protein samples were collected from the cerebellar cortices 1 hour after the training on days 1, 3, and 5, and analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that the expression of Arc, but not zif268, was significantly increased in the cerebellum following motor skill learning. These findings suggest that motor skill learning induces Arc expression in the cerebellum, which may play a role in acquiring complex motor skills.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The present study tested the ability of juvenile grey bamboo sharks to perceive colour in an experimental design based on a paradigm established by Karl von Frisch using colours in combination with grey distractor stimuli of equal brightness. Results showed that contrasts but no colours could be discriminated. Blue and yellow stimuli were not distinguished from a grey distractor stimulus of equal brightness but could be distinguished from distractor stimuli of varying brightness. In addition, different grey stimuli were distinguished significantly above chance level from one another. In conclusion, the behavioural results support the previously collected physiological data on bamboo sharks, which mutually show that the grey bamboo shark, like several marine mammals, is a cone monochromate and colourblind.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Parental environmental exposure affects the fertilization of eggs, but the underlying biochemical mechanism is largely unresolved. In this study, the parental environmental effects on fertilization of eggs were explored in the silkworm Bombyx mori (B. mori), an ideal lepidopteran animal model. The results showed that the rate of fertilization decreased after the parents were exposed to a poor environment at 32 °C with continuous illumination for 72 h on days 6–9 of the pupal stage, which is a key period for germ cell maturation. This was likely attributable to lower energy charge values, obstructed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regeneration and inactive tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to accumulation of large amounts of pyruvic acid and lactic acid. This effect was related to energy metabolism via glycolysis; in particular disruption of pyruvate metabolism.

Schlieren photography, high-definition laser scanning and ray tracing were used to determine the optical properties of excised crystalline lenses. Both species have multifocal lenses, an optical adaptation for improved color vision. In polar cod, the optical properties of the lens were independent of light exposure. In the more southern Atlantic cod, the optical properties of the lens changed within hours upon exposure to light, even after months of darkness. Such fast optical adjustment has previously only been shown in a tropical cichlid. During the polar night the Atlantic cod lens seems to be unregulated and dysfunctional since it had an unsuitable focal length and severe spherical aberration.

A temporal structure may arise in a chorus because of competitive and cooperative factors that favor certain signal interactions between neighbors. This temporal structure can generate significant acoustic interference among singers that pose problems for communication, mate finding, and predator detection. Acoustic insects can reduce interference by means of selective attention to only their nearest neighbors and by alternating calls with neighbors. Alternatively, they may synchronize, allowing them to preserve call rhythm and also to listen for predators during the silent intervals between calls. Moreover, males singing in choruses may benefit from reduced per capita predation risk as well as enhanced vigilance. They may also enjoy greater per capita attractiveness to females, particularly in the case of synchronous choruses. In many cases, however, the overall temporal structure of the chorus is only an emergent property of simple, pairwise interactions between neighbors. Nonetheless, the chorus that emerges can impose significant selection pressure on the singing of those individual males. Thus, feedback loops may occur and potentially influence traits at both individual and group levels in a chorus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Investigating the relationship between these processes provides a model to address more general questions of how the brain prioritizes homeostatically regulated behaviors. The availability of powerful genetic tools in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, allows for precise manipulation of neural function in freely behaving animals. There is a strong conservation of genes and neural circuit principles regulating sleep and metabolic function, and genetic screens in fruit flies have been effective in identifying novel regulators of these processes.

In the case of particle velocity receivers such as the antennae of mosquitoes, directionality is no problem because such receivers are inherently directional. Insects equipped with bilateral pairs of tympanate ears could principally make use of binaural cues for sound localization, like all other animals with two ears. However, their small size is a major problem to create sufficiently large binaural cues, with respect to both interaural time differences (ITDs, because interaural distances are so small), but also with respect to interaural intensity differences (IIDs), since the ratio of body size to the wavelength of sound is rather unfavorable for diffractive effects.

Time to immobilisation, survival during recovery, swimming performance, heart rate, thoracic limb movement and the levels of heat shock protein 70 kDa 1A (HSP70 1A), catalase (CAT) and nitric oxide species (NOx) were determined in ECT-exposed and unexposed daphnids; we showed protective effects of ECT on Daphnia magna subjected to heat stress. Time to immobilisation of daphnids exposed to ECT was longer when compared to the unexposed animals. Also, survival rate during the recovery of daphnids previously treated with ECT was higher. ECT significantly attenuated a rapid increase of mean swimming velocity which was elevated in the unexposed daphnids. Moreover, we observed elevation of thoracic limb movement and modulation of heart rate in ECT-exposed animals. HSP70 1A and CAT levels were reduced in the presence of ECT. On the other hand, NOx level was slightly elevated in both ECT-treated and unexposed daphnids, however slightly higher NOx level was found in ECT-treated animals.

Trypsin in lobster is a polymorphic enzyme, showing isoforms that differ in their biochemical features and catalytic efficiencies. Molecular studies suggest that polymorphism in lobster trypsins may be non-neutral. Trypsin isoenzymes are differentially regulated by dietary proteins, and it seems that some isoenzymes have undergone adaptive evolution coupled with a divergence in expression rate to increase fitness.

The ancestral nesomyine colonized Madagascar from Africa ca. 30–15 mya at the onset of Oligocene global cooling. We tested the hypothesis that, contrary to what might be expected from Island Biogeography theory, post-colonization character displacement of thermoregulatory traits was constrained by phylogenetic inertia through climate adaptation. The study was conducted in the Parc National d’Ankarafantsika, Madagascar. We measured the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body temperature (Tb) patterns of naturally warm-acclimated, freshly captured adult long-tailed big-footed mice Macrotarsomys ingens (67.4 g). The mean ± SD BMR of M. ingens was 0.298 ± 0.032 Watts (n = 12), 31.7 % lower than that predicted by a phylogenetically independent allometric equation. Body mass was correlated with BMR. The lower critical limit of thermoneutrality (Tlc) was 30.7 °C. The mean ± SD Tb = 36.1 ± 0.8 °C (n = 12) compared well with the mean Tb values for myomorph rodents from the Afrotropical zone, but was lower than those of the Neotropical and Palearctic zones. M. ingens became pathologically hypothermic when exposed to ambient temperatures lower than 18 °C. The soil temperature at depths of 250 mm and deeper did not decrease below 22 °C throughout the austral winter. The thermoregulatory data for M. ingens did not differ from those that characterize mainland Afrotropical rodents. However, BMR and Tb were lower than those of Holarctic rodents. Thus, contrary to expectations of Island Biogeography theory that rapid character displacement often occurs in morphological and behavioural traits when mammals colonize islands, M. ingens displayed climate-related physiological traits indicative of phylogenetic inertia. Presumably the tropical conditions that prevailed on Madagascar at the time of colonisation differed very little from those of the African mainland, and hence there was no strong driving force for change.

Amongst the latter, mitochondrial uncoupling is of key importance because it is suggested to drive heat production at a low cost in terms of oxidative stress. While this has been experimentally shown in mammals, the oxidative stress consequences of cold exposure and mitochondrial uncoupling are clearly less understood in the other class of endotherms, the birds. We compared metabolic and oxidative stress responses of zebra finches chronically treated with or without a chemical mitochondrial uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol: DNP), undergoing an acute (24 h) and a chronic (4 weeks) cold exposure (12 °C). We predicted that control birds should present at least a transient elevation of oxidative stress levels in response to cold exposure. This oxidative stress cost should be more pronounced in control birds than in DNP-treated birds, due to their lower basal uncoupling state. Despite similar increase in metabolism, control birds presented elevated levels of DNA oxidative damage in response to acute (but not chronic) cold exposure, while DNP-treated birds did not. Plasma antioxidant capacity decreased overall in response to chronic cold exposure. These results show that acute cold exposure increases oxidative stress in birds. However, uncoupling mitochondrial functioning appears as a putative compensatory mechanism preventing cold-induced oxidative stress. This result confirms previous observations in mice and underlines non-shivering thermogenesis as a putative key mechanism for endotherms in mounting a response to cold at a low oxidative cost.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

On an area-specific basis, unidirectional Na+ UR was highest in the mid-intestine, but when total gut area was taken into account, the three intestinal sections contributed equally, with very low rates in the stomach. The theoretical capacity for Na+ uptake across the whole GIT is sufficient to supply all of the animal’s nutritive requirements for Na+. Transport occurs by low affinity systems with apparent Km values 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than those in the gills, in accord with comparably higher Na+ concentrations in chyme versus fresh water. Fluid transport appeared to be Na+-dependent, such that treatments which altered unidirectional Na+ UR generally altered FTR in a comparable fashion. Pharmacological trials (amiloride, EIPA, phenamil, bafilomycin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) conducted at a mucosal Na+ concentration of 50 mmol L−1 indicated that GIT Na+ uptake occurs by a variety of apical mechanisms (NHE, Na+ channel/H+ ATPase, NCC, NKCC) with relative contributions varying among sections. However, at a mucosal Na+ concentration of 10 mmol L−1, EIPA, phenamil, bafilomycin, and hydrochlorothiazide were no longer effective in inhibiting unidirectional Na+ UR or FTR, suggesting the contribution of unidentified mechanisms under low Na+ conditions.

Orchiectomy was followed by an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary and subsequently, increased adrenocortical activity; the latter was evidenced by orchiectomy-induced increases in the adrenal content of cholesterol and lipids as well as adrenal hypertrophy (seen as an elevation of the RNA/DNA ratio). Further, androgen deprivation respectively up- and downregulated the incidence of apoptosis within the glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata and sex steroid-producing zona reticularis. Interestingly, orchiectomy resulted in increased expression of AR in the zona fasciculata.

Intestinal HCO3− secretion is associated with an equimolar transport of protons (H+) into the blood, both being proportional to environmental salinity. We hypothesized that the H+-sensitive haemoglobin (Hb) system of seawater teleosts could be exploited via the Bohr and/or Root effects (reduced Hb-O2 affinity and/or capacity with decreasing pH) to improve O2 delivery to intestinal cells during high metabolic demand associated with osmoregulation. To test this, we characterized H+ equilibria and gas exchange properties of European flounder (Platichthys flesus)
haemoglobin and constructed a model incorporating these values, intestinal blood flow rates and arterial–venous acidification at three different environmental salinities (33, 60 and 90). The model suggested red blood cell pH (pHi) during passage through intestinal capillaries could be reduced by 0.14–0.33 units (depending on external salinity) which is sufficient to activate the Bohr effect (Bohr coefficient of −0.63), and perhaps even the Root effect, and enhance tissue O2 delivery by up to 42 % without changing blood flow. In vivo measurements of intestinal venous blood pH were not possible in flounder but were in seawater-acclimated rainbow trout which confirmed a blood acidification of no less than 0.2 units (equivalent to −0.12 for pHi). When using trout-specific values for the model variables, predicted values were consistent with measured in vivo values, further supporting the
model. Thus this system is an elegant example of autoregulation: as the need for costly osmoregulatory processes (including HCO3− secretion) increases at higher environmental salinity, so does the enhancement of O2 delivery to the intestine via a localized acidosis and the Bohr (and possibly Root) effect.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

They also have a high level of variability in both active and resting Tbs and, at least in cool temperatures in captivity, frequently employ both short- and long-term torpor. The use of heterothermy by captive animals is, however, generally reduced during gestation and lactation. We present data long-term Tb recordings collected from free-ranging S. setosus over the course of two reproductive seasons. In general, reproductive females had slightly higher (~32 °C) and less variable Tb, whereas non-reproductive females and males showed both a higher propensity for torpor as well as lower (~30.5 °C) and more variable rest-phase Tbs. Torpor expression defined using traditional means (using a threshold or cut-off Tb) was much lower than predicted based on the high degree of heterothermy in captive tenrecs. However, torpor defined in this manner is likely to be underestimated in habitats where ambient temperature is close to Tb. Our results caution against inferring metabolic states from Tb alone and lend support to the recent call to define torpor in free-ranging animals based on mechanistic and not descriptive variables. In addition, lower variability in Tb observed during gestation and lactation confirms that homeothermy is essential for reproduction in this species and probably for basoendothermic mammals in general. The relatively low costs of maintaining homeothermy in a sub-tropical environment might help shed light on how homeothermy could have evolved incrementally from an ancestral heterothermic condition.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The most important factor accounting for its variation is body mass as long as the range in mass is appreciable. But mass never accounts for all of the variation and none if species have the same mass. Most of the residual variation around the mass curve is associated with behavioral characters, ecological factors, and phylogeny, i.e., history. These agents influence energy expenditure by different means and at different stages in the life history of species. Phylogeny describes the historic origin, evolution, and distribution of character states in contemporary species. However, the level of energy expenditure is quantitatively determined by the collective of realized states in combination with conditions in the environment. Therefore, two stages determine energy expenditure: (1) the evolution of character states and (2) their impact in conjunction with conditions on the environment. Behavioral characters and ecological factors, when coupled with log10 mass, usually account for >94 % of the variation in the log10 basal rates of birds and mammals, a capacity not found in phylogenetic analyses. The difficulty of determining a direct impact of phylogeny on physiological characters results from its correlation with behavioral characters. When appropriate, the passerine/non-passerine dichotomy in birds and the sub/infraclass dichotomy in mammals combine with behavioral characters, ecological factors, and log10 mass to increase r2 to account for 96–99 % of the variation in log10 basal rate. This occurs because dichotomies incorporate factors other than those already in the analyses. The clearest demonstration of the direct impact of character states is the equality of energy expenditure in species convergent with species from other clades without any evidence of the clade to which the species belong. A multifactorial approach depends on the inclusion of life history characteristics of species, but this analysis applies only to continuous, quantitative relationships, which are often modified by discontinuous agents. Distinctive character states distinguish species and therefore must be included in any attempt to account for differences in their level of energy expenditure. No analysis that ignores life history characteristics can account for the quantitative variation in energy expenditure beyond that associated with body mass.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Asymmetric spectral input along the dorsal–ventral axis influences postural responses in an amphibious annelid,"Medicinal leeches are predatory annelids that exhibit countershading and reside in aquatic environments where light levels might be variable. They also leave the water and must contend with terrestrial environments. Yet, leeches generally maintain a dorsal upward position despite lacking statocysts. Leeches respond visually to both green and near-ultraviolet (UV) light. I used LEDs to test the hypothesis that ventral, but not dorsal UV would evoke compensatory movements to orient the body. Untethered leeches were tested using LEDs emitting at red (632 nm), green (513 nm), blue (455 nm) and UV (372 nm). UV light evoked responses in 100 % of trials and the leeches often rotated the ventral surface away from it. Visible light evoked no or modest responses (12–15 % of trials) and no body rotation. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ventral sensilla responded best to UV, dorsal sensilla to green. Additionally, a higher order interneuron that is engaged in a variety of parallel networks responded vigorously to UV presented ventrally, and both the visible and UV responses exhibited pronounced light adaptation. These results strongly support the suggestion that a dorsal light reflex in the leech uses spectral comparisons across the dorsal–ventral axis rather than, or in addition to, luminance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Meanwhile, the expression levels of five genes (AcCREB, Acdop1, Acdop2, Acdop3, Actyr1) related to learning and memory were analyzed under different training conditions by real-time RT-PCR.

Maximal force output, twitch contraction durations and the force–frequency relationship were determined in tensor propatagialis pars biceps muscle from young 3-year-old pigeons, middle-aged 18-year-old pigeons, and aged 30-year-old pigeons. The fiber CSA distribution was determined by planimetry from muscle sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Maximal force output of twitch and tetanic contractions was greatest in muscles from young pigeons, while the time to peak force of twitch contractions was longest in muscles from aged pigeons. There were no changes in the force–frequency relationship between the age groups. Interestingly, the fiber CSA distribution in aged muscles revealed a greater number of larger sized muscle fibers, which was verified visually in histological images. Middle-aged and aged muscles also displayed a greater amount of slow myosin containing muscle fibers. These data demonstrate that muscles from middle-aged and aged pigeons are susceptible to alterations in contractile properties that are consistent with aging, including lower force production and longer contraction durations. These functional changes were supported by the appearance of slow myosin containing muscle fibers in muscles from middle-aged and aged pigeons. Therefore, the pigeon may represent an appropriate animal model for the study of aging-related alterations in skeletal muscle function and structure.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This should promote rapid development of the muscle biochemistry that supports diving, but previous research on two odontocete (toothed whales and dolphins) species showed protracted postnatal development for myoglobin content and buffering capacity. A minimum of 1 and 1.5 years were required for Fraser’s (Lagenodelphis hosei) and bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins to obtain mature myoglobin contents, respectively; this corresponded to their lengthy 2 and 2.5-year calving intervals (a proxy for the dependency period of cetacean calves). To further examine the correlation between the durations for muscle maturation and maternal dependency, we measured myoglobin content and buffering capacity in the main locomotor muscle (longissimus dorsi) of harbor porpoises (Phocoenaphocoena), a species with a comparatively short calving interval (1.5 years). We found that at birth, porpoises had 51 and 69 % of adult levels for myoglobin and buffering capacity, respectively, demonstrating greater muscle maturity at birth than that found previously for neonatal bottlenose dolphins (10 and 65 %, respectively). Porpoises achieved adult levels for myoglobin and buffering capacity by 9–10 months and 2–3 years postpartum, respectively. This muscle maturation occurred at an earlier age than that found previously for the dolphin species. These results support the observation that variability in the duration for muscular development is associated with disparate life history patterns across odontocetes, suggesting that the pace of muscle maturation is not solely influenced by exposure to hypoxia and exercise. Though the mechanism that drives this variability remains unknown, nonetheless, these results highlight the importance of documenting the species-specific physiological development that limits diving capabilities and ultimately defines habitat utilization patterns across age classes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Few studies have characterised whether insects exhibit characteristic ‘malaise-like’ behaviours in response to intoxication. Here, we used the honeybee to investigate how intoxication produced by injection or ingestion with three toxins with different pharmacological modes of action quinine, amygdalin, and lithium chloride affected behaviour. We found that toxin-induced changes in behaviour were best characterised by more time spent grooming. Bees also had difficulty performing the righting reflex and exhibited specific toxin-induced behaviours such as abdomen dragging and curling up. The expression of these behaviours also depended on whether a toxin had been injected or ingested. When toxins were ingested, they were least 10 times less concentrated in the haemolymph than in the ingested food, suggesting that their absorption through the gut is strongly regulated. Our data show that bees exhibit changes in behaviour that are characteristic of ‘malaise’ and suggest that physiological signalling of toxicosis is accomplished by multiple post-ingestive pathways in animals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study uses ball balancing, a dynamic sensorimotor skill that is often used in human and robotic coordination studies, to promote sea lion whisker movements during the task. For the first time, using tracked video footage, we show that sea lion whisker movements respond quickly (26.70 ms) and mirror the movement of the ball, much more so than the head.

However, the question as to how these two components are interconnected in small endotherms by means of the host diet remains only poorly understood. Here, we tested in laboratory mice whether dietary proteins and carbohydrates can modulate the interplay between energy expenditure, food intake and the innate and adaptive immune response when confronting a bacterial challenge (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG). We observed that mice fed with a high protein diet (HP) developed a better immune response associated to increased numbers of circulating monocytes. In addition, HP diet directly influenced the peripheral blood proportions of both T and B lymphocytes even before the BCG challenge. Interestingly, animals that developed this type of immune response after BCG challenge showed an increased rate of metabolism and food consumption before being challenged. Thus, HP diet induced in non-challenged animals a similar energy expenditure and food intake described by BCG-treated mice. These data suggest that a high amount of proteins in diet can modify the energetic and nutrient dynamic in the host causing a better immune reaction against a microbial challenge.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In vertebrates, arterial or venous adenosine injection causes a rapid and large bradycardia through atrioventricular node block, a response mediated by adenosine receptors that inhibit adenylate cyclase and decrease cyclic AMP concentration. Chronic developmental hypoxia has been shown to alter cardioregulatory mechanisms in reptile embryos, but adenosine’s role in mediating these responses is not known. We incubated snapping turtle embryos under chronic normoxic (N21; 21 % O2) or chronic hypoxic conditions (H10; 10 % O2) beginning at 20 % of embryonic incubation. H10 embryos at 90 % of incubation were hypotensive relative to N21 embryos in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia caused a hypotensive bradycardia in both N21 and H10 embryos during the initial 30 min of exposure; however, fH and Pm both trended towards increasing during the subsequent 30 min, and H10 embryos were tachycardic relative to N21 embryos in hypoxia. Following serial ≥1 h exposure to normoxic and hypoxic conditions, a single injection of adenosine (1 mg kg−1) was given. N21 and H10 embryos responded to adenosine injection with a rapid and large hypotensive bradycardia in both normoxia and hypoxia. Gene expression for adenosine receptors were quantified in cardiac tissue, and Adora1 mRNA was the predominant receptor subtype with transcript levels 30–82-fold higher than Adora2A or Adora2B. At 70 % of incubation, H10 embryos had lower Adora1 and Adora2B expression compared to N21 embryos. Expression of Adora1 and Adora2B decreased in N21 embryos during development and did not differ from H10 embryos at 90 % of incubation. Similar to previous results in normoxia, H10 embryos in hypoxia were chronically tachycardic compared to N21 embryos before and after complete cholinergic and adrenergic blockade. Chronic hypoxia altered the development of normal cholinergic and adrenergic tone, as well as adenosine receptor mRNA levels. This study demonstrates that adenosine may be a major regulator of heart rate in developing snapping turtle embryos, and that chronic hypoxic incubation alters the response to hypoxic exposure.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The fish were collected directly from the Rio Negro, and studied in their native “blackwater” which is acidic (pH 4.5), ion-poor (Na+, Cl− ~20 µM), and rich in dissolved organic matter (DOM 11.5 mg C l−1). JinNa, JinCl, and JAmm were higher than in previous reports on tetras obtained from the North America aquarium trade and/or studied in low DOM water. In all three species, JinNa was unaffected by amiloride (10−4 M, NHE and Na+ channel blocker), but both JinNa and JinCl were virtually eliminated (85–99 % blockade) by AgNO3 (10−7 M). A time course study on cardinal tetras demonstrated that JinNa blockade by AgNO3 was very rapid (<5 min), suggesting inhibition of branchial carbonic anhydrase (CA), and exposure to the CA-blocker acetazolamide (10−4 M) caused a 50 % reduction in JinNa.. Additionally, JinNa was unaffected by phenamil (10−5 M, Na+ channel blocker), bumetanide (10−4 M, NKCC blocker), hydrochlorothiazide (5 × 10−3 M, NCC blocker), and exposure to an acute 3 unit increase in water pH. None of these treatments, including partial or complete elimination of JinNa (by acetazolamide and AgNO3 respectively), had any inhibitory effect on JAmm. Therefore, Na+ uptake in Rio Negro tetras depends on an internal supply of H+ from CA, but does not fit any of the currently accepted H+-dependent models (NHE, Na+ channel/V-type H+-ATPase), or co-transport schemes (NCC, NKCC), and ammonia excretion does not fit the current “Na+/NH4+ exchange metabolon” paradigm. Na+, K+-ATPase and V-type H+-ATPase activities were present at similar levels in gill homogenates, Acute exposure to high environmental ammonia (NH4Cl, 10−3 M) significantly increased JinNa, and NH4+ was equally or more effective than K+ in activating branchial Na+,(K+) ATPase activity in vitro.

In our previous study, when goats were kept on an N-reduced diet, a decrease of plasma urea concentration and an increase of renal urea transporters were demonstrated. Renal urea absorption plays a crucial role for renal water absorption and urine concentration. Renal collecting duct water absorption is mainly mediated by the water channel aquaporin 1 and 2 (AQP1 and AQP2). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a dietary N reduction on expression of renal AQP1 and AQP2 in young goats. Twenty male White Saanen goats, 3 months old, were divided equally into two feeding groups, receiving either a diet with an adequate or a reduced-N supply. Goats fed a reduced-N diet showed significantly higher amounts of AQP1 mRNA in cortical tissue, and the expression of AQP2 mRNA and protein were highly elevated in renal outer medulla. An increase of vasopressin concentrations in plasma were detected for the N-reduced fed goats. Therefore, a stimulation of renal water absorption can be assumed. This might be an advantage for ruminants in times of N reduction due to higher urea concentrations in the tubular fluid and which might result in higher absorption of urea by renal urea transporters. Therefore, interplay of aquaporin water channels and urea transporters in the kidney may occur to maintain urea metabolism in times of N scarcity in young goats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated the performance of auditory receptor neurons and properties of the tympanal membrane of Locusta migratoria in response to temperature changes. Intracellular recordings of receptors at two temperatures (21 and 28 °C) revealed a moderate increase in spike rate with a mean Q10 of 1.4. With rising temperature, the spike rate–intensity–functions exhibited small decreases in thresholds and expansions of the dynamic range, while spike durations decreased. Tympanal membrane displacement, investigated using microscanning laser vibrometry, exhibited a small temperature effect, with a Q10 of 1.2. These findings suggest that locusts are affected by shifts in temperature at the periphery of the auditory pathway, but the effects on spike rate, sensitivity, and tympanal membrane displacement are small. Robust encoding of acoustic signals by only slightly temperature-dependent receptor neurons and almost temperature-independent tympanal membrane properties might enable locusts and grasshoppers to reliably identify sounds in spite of changes of their body temperature.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The complete cDNA coding sequences of ass and asl from the liver of Protopterus annectens consisted of 1,296 and 1,398 bp, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the deduced Ass and Asl of P. annectens had close relationship with that of the cartilaginous fish Callorhinchusmilii. Besides being strongly expressed in the liver, ass and asl expression were detectable in many tissues/organs. In the liver, mRNA expression levels of ass and asl increased significantly during the induction phase of aestivation, probably to increase arginine production to support increased urea synthesis. The increases in ass and asl mRNA expression levels during the prolonged maintenance phase and early arousal phase of aestivation could reflect increased demand on arginine for nitric oxide (NO) production in the liver. In the kidney, there was a significant decrease in ass mRNA expression level after 6 months of aestivation, indicating possible decreases in the synthesis and supply of arginine to other tissues/organs. In the brain, changes in ass and asl mRNA expression levels during the three phases of aestivation could be related to the supply of arginine for NO synthesis in response to conditions that resemble ischaemia and ischaemia–reperfusion during the maintenance and arousal phase of aestivation, respectively. The decrease in ass mRNA expression level, accompanied with decreases in the concentrations of arginine and NO, in the skeletal muscle of aestivating P. annectens might ameliorate the potential of disuse muscle atrophy.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, uptake rate by muscle plateaus at moderate aerobic exercise intensities and intracellular fuels dominate at oxygen consumption rates of 50 % of maximum or more. Further, uptake and oxidation of circulating fructose by muscle is negligible. In contrast, hummingbirds and nectar bats are capable of fueling expensive hovering flight exclusively, or nearly completely, with dietary sugar. In addition, hummingbirds and nectar bats appear capable of fueling hovering flight completely with fructose. Three crucial steps are believed to be rate limiting to muscle uptake of circulating glucose or fructose in vertebrates: (1) delivery to muscle; (2) transport into muscle through glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs); and (3) phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK) within the muscle. In this review, we summarize what is known about the functional upregulation of exogenous sugar flux at each of these steps in hummingbirds and nectar bats. High cardiac output, capillary density, and blood sugar levels in hummingbirds and bats enhance sugar delivery to muscles (step 1). Hummingbird and nectar bat flight muscle fibers have relatively small cross-sectional areas and thus relatively high surface areas across which transport can occur (step 2). Maximum HK activities in each species are enough for carbohydrate flux through glycolysis to satisfy 100 % of hovering oxidative demand (step 3). However, qualitative patterns of GLUT expression in the muscle (step 2) raise more questions than they answer regarding sugar transport in hummingbirds and suggest major differences in the regulation of sugar flux compared to nectar bats. Behavioral and physiological similarities among hummingbirds, nectar bats, and other vertebrates suggest enhanced capacities for exogenous fuel use during exercise may be more wide spread than previously appreciated. Further, how the capacity for uptake and phosphorylation of circulating fructose is enhanced remains a tantalizing unknown.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Using data from four recent studies that simultaneously measured $$\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2}$$V˙O2 and $$\dot{V}{\text{aO}}_{ 2}$$V˙aO2 in 2–5 kg Pacific salmon, our analysis revealed that sockeye salmon can remove an additional 12–48 % more O2 from the water than the primary circulation delivers to the systemic tissues. This percentage did not change significantly during swimming activity, a result that contradicts an earlier prediction that the difference should decrease when $$\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2}$$V˙O2 increases during exercise. In resting Chinook salmon, a similar percentage difference in simultaneously measured $$\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2}$$V˙O2 and $$\dot{V}{\text{O}}_{ 2}$$V˙O2 was observed, yet the difference tended to disappear during acute heat stress to a near lethal temperature.

When these animals assume a vertical orientation, gravity tends to reduce venous return, cardiac filling, cardiac output and blood pressure to the anterior regions of the body. The hypotension triggers physiological responses, which generally include vasomotor adjustments and tachycardia to normalize blood pressure. While some studies have focused on understanding the regulation of these vasomotor adjustments in ectothermic vertebrates, little is known about regulation and the importance of heart rate in these animals during orthostasis. We acquired heart rate and carotid pulse pressure (PPC) in pythons in their horizontal position, and during 30 and 60° inclinations while the animals were either untreated (control) or upon muscarinic cholinoceptor blockade and a double autonomic blockade. Double autonomic blockade completely eradicated the orthostatic-tachycardia, and without this adjustment, the PPC reduction caused by the tilts became higher than that which was observed in untreated animals. On the other hand, post-inclinatory vasomotor adjustments appeared to be of negligible importance in counterbalancing the hemodynamic effects of gravity. Finally, calculations of cardiac autonomic tones at each position revealed that the orthostatic-tachycardia is almost completely elicited by a withdrawal of vagal drive.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, when observing them axially under microscope one sees them as green. We used single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) to reveal the basis of the perceived color of these photoreceptors. Conventional side-on MSP recording of the proximal cell segments reveals no selective long-wave absorbing pigment explaining the green color. End-on MSP recording shows, in addition to the green rod visual pigment, an extra 2- to 4-fold attenuation being almost flat throughout the visible spectrum. This attenuation is absent in red (rhodopsin) rods, and vanishes in green rods when the retina is bathed in high-refractive media, and at wide illumination aperture. The same treatments change the color from green to yellow. It seems that the non-visual pigment attenuation is a result of slender green rod myoids operating as non-selective light guides. We hypothesize that narrow myoids, combined with photomechanical movements of melanin granules, allow a wide range of sensitivity regulation supporting the operation of green rods as blue receptors at mesopic-to low-photopic illumination levels. End-on transmittance spectrum of green rods looks similar to the reflectance spectrum of khaki military uniforms. So their greenness is the combined result of optics and human color vision.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

By means of a field and experimental approach, we evaluated the effect of diet on the activity of three esterases involved in FA hydrolysis; carboxylesterase (CE: 4-NPA-CE and a-NA-CE) and butyrylcholinesterase, in two South American passerines: the omnivorous rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the granivorous common diuca-finch (Diuca diuca). The activity of the three esterases was measured in the intestines of freshly caught individuals over two distinct seasons and also after a chronic intake of a UFA-rich or SFA-rich diet in the laboratory. In turn, we assessed the feeding responses of the birds choosing amongst diets contrasting in the kind of specific FA (UFA- vs. SFA-treated diets). During summer, field CE activities (4-NPA-CE and a-NA-CE) in the small intestine were higher in the rufous-collared sparrow (25.3 ± 3.3 and 81.4 ± 10.8 µmol min−1 g tissue−1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (10.0 ± 3.0 and 33.9 ± 13.1 µmol min−1 g tissue−1, respectively). Two hour feeding trial test indicated that both species exhibited a clear preference for UFA-treated diets. On average, the rufous-collared sparrow consumed 0.46 g 2 h−1 of UFA-rich diets and 0.12 g 2 h−1 of SFA-rich diets. In turn, the consumption pattern of the common diuca-finch averaged 0.73 and 0.16 g 2 h−1 for UFA-rich and SFA-rich diets, respectively. After a month of dietary acclimation to UFA-rich and SFA-rich diets, both species maintained body mass irrespective of the dietary regime. Additionally, the intestinal 4-NPA-CE activity exhibited by birds fed on a UFA-rich or SFA-rich diet was higher in the rufous-collared sparrow (39.0 ± 5.3 and 44.2 ± 7.3 µmol min−1 g tissue−1, respectively) than in the common diuca-finch (13.3 ± 1.9 and 11.2 ± 1.4 µmol min−1 g tissue−1, respectively). Finally, the intestinal a-NA-CE activity exhibited by the rufous-collared sparrow was about two times higher when consuming an UFA-rich diet. Our results suggest that the rufus-collared sparrow exhibits a greater capacity for intestinal FA hydrolysis, which would allow it to better deal with fats from different sources.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Some insects also emit sounds for bat defense. Here, we describe a previously unknown sound-producing organ in Geometrid moths—a prothoracic tymbal in the orange beggar moth (Eubaphe unicolor) that generates bursts of ultrasonic clicks in response to tactile stimulation and playback of a bat echolocation attack sequence. Using scanning electron microscopy and high-speed videography, we demonstrate that E. unicolor and phylogenetically distant tiger moths have evolved serially homologous thoracic tymbal organs with fundamentally similar functional morphology, a striking example of convergent evolution. We compared E. unicolor clicks to that of five sympatric tiger moths and found that 9 of 13 E. unicolor clicking parameters were within the range of sympatric tiger moths. Remaining differences may result from the small size of the E. unicolor tymbal. Four of the five sympatric clicking tiger moth species were unpalatable to bats (0–20 % eaten), whereas E. unicolor was palatable to bats (86 % eaten). Based on these results, we hypothesize that E. unicolor evolved tymbal organs that mimic the sounds produced by toxic tiger moths when attacked by echolocating bats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To determine whether preferential pHi regulation may represent a general pattern for acid–base regulation during other pH disturbances we challenged the armoured catfish, Pterygoplichthys pardalis, with anoxia and exhaustive exercise, to induce a metabolic acidosis, and bicarbonate injections to induce a metabolic alkalosis. Fish were terminally sampled 2–3 h following the respective treatments and extracellular blood pH, pHi of red blood cells (RBC), brain, heart, liver and white muscle, and plasma lactate and total CO2 were measured. All treatments resulted in significant changes in extracellular pH and RBC pHi that likely cover a large portion of the pH tolerance limits of this species (pH 7.15–7.86). In all tissues other than RBC, pHi remained tightly regulated and did not differ significantly from control values, with the exception of a decrease in white muscle pHi after anoxia and an increase in liver pHi following a metabolic alkalosis. Thus preferential pHi regulation appears to be a general pattern for acid–base homeostasis in the armoured catfish and may be a common response in Amazonian fishes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Acoustically active species are found throughout the vast diversity of anuran families. However, additional or alternative signal modalities have gained increasing attention. In several anurans, seismic, visual and chemical communications have convergently evolved due to ecological constraints such as noisy environments. The production of a visual cue, like the inevitably moving vocal sac of acoustically advertising males, is emphasized by conspicuously coloured throats. Limb movements accompanied by dynamic displays of bright colours are additional examples of striking visual signals independent of vocalizations. In some multimodal anuran communication systems, the acoustic component acts as an alert signal, which alters the receiver attention to the following visual display. Recent findings of colourful glands on vocal sacs, producing volatile species-specific scent bouquets suggest the possibility of integration of acoustic, visual and chemical cues in species recognition and mate choice. The combination of signal components facilitates a broadened display repertoire in challenging environmental conditions. Thus, the complexity of the communication systems of frogs and toads may have been underestimated.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

r mammals, bats in temperate regions employ short bouts of torpor throughout the reproductive period to maintain a positive energy balance. In addition to decreasing energy expenditure during the day, they typically alter foraging patterns as well. It is well known that various environmental conditions influence both torpor and foraging patterns, but studies of these factors often have focussed on one element in isolation thus it is not known how the two behaviours are collectively influencing temperate bats. The objective of our study was to assess how reproductive condition and environmental factors concurrently affect energy balance in female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). We equipped pregnant and lactating bats in southwest Saskatchewan, Canada with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. While transmitters were active, skin temperature data were collected and foraging patterns were determined using triangulation. Of the various environmental and physiological parameters used to model torpor characteristics, roost type was the most important factor. Bats roosting in trees used deeper and longer torpor bouts than those roosting in buildings. Lactating bats had a tendency to forage for longer durations than pregnant bats, and often made more foraging trips. When taken together, we found that foraging duration and torpor duration were not directly related during pregnancy, but exhibited an inverse relationship during lactation. This provides support for the hypothesis that there are physiological trade-offs for reproductive bats and suggests that how bats compensate is not entirely predictable based on current environmental conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hexapod leg muscles, for instance, may consist of a single to a few 100 fibres, and they are controlled by one to, rarely, 19 motoneurons. A typical mammal has thousands of fibres per muscle supplied by hundreds of motoneurons for comparable behavioural performances. Arthopods—crustaceans, hexapods, spiders, and their kin—are on average much smaller than vertebrates, and they possess inhibitory motoneurons for a motor control strategy that allows a broad performance spectrum despite necessarily small cell numbers. This arthropod motor control strategy is reviewed from functional and evolutionary perspectives and its components are described with a focus on inhibitory motoneurons. Inhibitory motoneurons are particularly interesting for a number of reasons: evolutionary and phylogenetic comparison of functional specialisations, evolutionary and developmental origin and diversification, and muscle fibre recruitment strategies.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Echolocation pulses were recorded using a telemetry microphone mounted on the bat combined with a 17-channel horizontal microphone array to measure pulse directions. Flight paths of the bat and moths were monitored using two high-speed video cameras. Acoustical measurements of returning echoes from fluttering moths were first collected using an ultrasonic loudspeaker, turning the head direction of the moth relative to the loudspeaker from 0° (front) to 180° (back) in the horizontal plane. The amount of acoustical glints caused by moth fluttering varied with the sound direction, reaching a maximum at 70°–100° in the horizontal plane. In the flight experiment, moths chosen by the bat fluttered within or moved across these angles relative to the bat’s pulse direction, which would cause maximum dynamic changes in the frequency and amplitude of acoustical glints during flight. These results suggest that echoes with acoustical glints containing the strongest frequency and amplitude modulations appear to attract bats for prey selection.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The type, expression levels and activity of AQPs play a major role in the relative permeability of each cell to water or other solutes.

To this end we measured energy expenditure (metabolic rate) and body temperature of 24 naturally acclimatized mouse lemurs, kept in outdoor enclosures, during different seasons (summer, winter, and the transition period between the two seasons). Mouse lemurs displayed two main physiological strategies to compensate seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of ambient temperature. On the one hand, individuals entered hypometabolism with decreasing ambient temperature (Ta) during the transition period and winter, enabling them to save up to 21 % energy per day (92 % per hour) compared with the normal resting metabolic rate at comparable Ta. On the other hand, euthermic mouse lemurs also showed physiological adjustments to seasonality when resting: the lower critical temperature of the thermoneutral zone decreased from summer to winter by 7.5 °C, which allowed mouse lemurs to keep energy demands constant despite colder Tas during winter. In addition, the basal metabolic rate was substantially lowered prior to the winter period, which facilitated accumulation of fat reserves. The combination of physiological modifications during euthermia in addition to hypometabolism, which can be individually adjusted according to external parameters and respective body condition, is important as it allows M. griseorufus to cope with the environmental variability of an energetically challenging habitat.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The mean 24-h amplitude of the body temperature rhythm in summer (2.5 ± 0.1 °C) was lower than that in winter (3.2 ± 0.4 °C), with the highest amplitude for an individual monkey (5.6 °C) recorded in winter. The higher amplitude of the body temperature rhythm in winter was a consequence primarily of lower 24-h minimum body temperatures during the nocturnal phase, when monkeys were inactive. These low minimum body temperatures were associated with low black globe temperature (GLMM, β = 0.046, P < 0.001), short photoperiod (β = 0.010, P < 0.001) and low rainfall over the previous 2 months, which we used as a proxy for food availability (β = 0.001, P < 0.001).

Contrary to expectations, we found no differences in feed intake, gut morphology or gastrolith mass between the LF- and HF-fed quail. However, when switched from the LF to HF diet, the quail commenced feed-sorting behaviours that permitted HF-fed animals to maintain body condition (mass, abdominal fat mass) without adjustments to intestinal organ sizes or gastrolith mass. Feed sorting was initiated only after exposure to the HF diet, which corresponded with an immediate reduction in food intake, suggesting that the sorting behaviour was cued by a physiological challenge associated with the HF diet.

Cell DE-3, a dorsal excitatory motor neuron in the medicinal leech exhibits PIR responses that persist for several seconds following the offset of hyperpolarizing stimuli and are suppressed in reduced Na+ solutions or by Ca2+ channel blockers. The long duration and Na+ dependence of PIR suggest a possible role for persistent Na+ current (INaP). In vertebrate neurons, the neuroprotective agent riluzole can produce a selective block of INaP. This study demonstrates that riluzole inhibits cell DE-3 PIR in a concentration- and Ca2+-dependent manner. In 1.8 mM Ca2+ solution, 50–100 µM riluzole selectively blocked the late phase of PIR, an effect similar to that of the neuromodulator serotonin. However, 200 µM riluzole blocked both the early and late phases of PIR. Increasing extracellular Ca2+ to 10 mM strengthened PIR, but high riluzole concentrations continued to suppress both phases of PIR. These results indicate that riluzole may suppress PIR via a nonspecific inhibition of Ca2+ conductances and suggest that a Ca2+-activated nonspecific current (ICAN), rather than INaP, may underlie the Na+-dependent component of PIR.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This suggests that the light environment is a key driver of variation in eye size. Yet other factors not directly linked with visual tasks (i.e., non-sensory factors) may influence eye size. We sought to jointly investigate the roles of sensory (light) and non-sensory factors (food) in determining eye size and ask whether non-sensory factors could constrain visual capabilities. We tested environmental influences on eye size in four species of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia, crossing bright and dim light levels with high and low resource levels. We measured absolute eye size and eye size relative to body size in early and late adulthood. In general, Daphnia reared on low resources had smaller eyes, both absolutely and relatively. In contrast to the dominant macroevolutionary pattern, phenotypic plasticity in response to light was rarely significant. These patterns of phenotypic plasticity were true for overall diameter of the eye and the diameter of individual facets. We conclude that non-sensory environmental factors can influence sensory systems, and in particular, that resource availability may be an important constraint on visual capability.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hibernation and daily torpor (heterothermy) have long been assumed to be adaptive responses to seasonal energy shortage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that food shortage alone can trigger the use of heterothermy. However, their potential to predict heterothermic responses in the wild is limited, and few field studies demonstrate the dependence of heterothermy on food availability under natural conditions. Thus, the view of heterothermy as an energy saving strategy to compensate for food shortage largely remains an untested hypothesis. In this paper, we review published evidence on the proximate role of food availability in heterothermy regulation by endotherms, and emphasize alternative hypotheses that remain to be tested. Most studies have relied on correlative evidence. Manipulations of food availability, that demonstrate the proximate role of food availability, have been conducted in only five free-ranging heterotherms. Several other metabolic constraints covary with food availability and can confound its effect. Shortage in water availability, the nutritional composition of food, or subsequent conversion of food in fat storage all could be actual proximate drivers of heterothermy regulation, rather than food shortage. Social interactions, competition for food and predation also likely modulate the relative strength of food shortage between individuals. The ecological relevance of the dependence of heterothermy on food availability remains to be assessed in field experiments that account for the confounding effects of covarying environmental and internal factors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It has been proposed that accessory lobes act as a sensory organ of equilibrium and neurons in accessory lobes transmit sensory information to the motor center. We have reported that cells in chick accessory lobes express functional voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels and generate action potentials. In this study, we examined properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). The amplitude of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel currents carried by Ca2+ and Ba2+ increased gradually during 10 min rather than showing the usual run-down. The current–voltage relationship of Ba2+ currents was consistent with that of the high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel. The proportion of Ba2+ currents inhibited by ω-conotoxin GVIA was larger than 80 %, indicating that the major subtype is N type. Amplitudes of tail currents of Ca2+ currents evoked by repetitive pulses at 50 Hz are stable for 1 s. If the major subtype of VGCCs at synaptic terminals is also N type, this property may contribute to the establishment of stable synaptic connections between accessory lobe neurons, which are reported to fire at frequencies higher than 15 Hz, and postsynaptic neurons in the spinal cord.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

One possibility is that apparent ‘errors’ in a learning task actually represent an alternative foraging strategy. In this study we investigate the potential relationship between foraging ‘errors’ and foraging success among bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) workers. Individual foragers were trained to choose yellow, rewarded flowers and ignore blue, unrewarded flowers. We recorded the number of errors (visits to unrewarded flowers) each bee made during training, then tested them to determine how quickly they discovered a more profitable food source (either familiar blue flowers, or novel green flowers). We found that error prone bees discovered the novel food source significantly faster than accurate bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time taken to discover the novel, more profitable, food source is positively correlated with foraging success. These results suggest that foraging errors are part of an ‘exploration’ foraging strategy, which could be advantageous in changeable foraging environments. This could explain the observed variation in learning performance amongst foragers within social insect colonies.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The trichromatic colour vision of honeybees shares fundamental properties with primate and human colour perception, such as colour constancy, colour opponency, segregation of colour and brightness coding. Laborious efforts to reconstruct the colour vision pathway in the honeybee have provided detailed descriptions of neural connectivity and the properties of photoreceptors and interneurons in the optic lobes of the bee brain. The modelling of colour perception advanced with the establishment of colour discrimination models that were based on experimental data, the Colour-Opponent Coding and Receptor Noise-Limited models, which are important tools for the quantitative assessment of bee colour vision and colour-guided behaviours. Major insights into the visual ecology of bees have been gained combining behavioural experiments and quantitative modelling, and asking how bee vision has influenced the evolution of flower colours and patterns. Recently research has focussed on the discrimination and categorisation of coloured patterns, colourful scenes and various other groupings of coloured stimuli, highlighting the bees’ behavioural flexibility.

Although in previous studies, evidence was provided for the involvement of auditory mechanoreceptors, the source of DPOAE generation and possible active mechanisms in tympanal organs remained unknown. Using laser Doppler vibrometry in the locust ear, we show that DPOAEs mechanically emerge at the tympanum region where the auditory mechanoreceptors are attached. Those emission-coupled vibrations differed remarkably from tympanum waves evoked by external pure tones of the same frequency, in terms of wave propagation, energy distribution, and location of amplitude maxima. Selective inactivation of the auditory receptor cells by mechanical lesions did not affect the tympanum’s response to external pure tones, but abolished the emission’s displacement amplitude peak. These findings provide evidence that tympanal auditory receptors, comparable to the situation in mammals, comprise the required nonlinear response characteristics, which during two-tone stimulation lead to additional, highly localized deflections of the tympanum.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Two experiments tested whether looming-evoked flight behaviour was affected by the presence (1) or relative position (2) of a conspecific. We recorded: the type of behavioural response, motion within 6 degrees of freedom, behavioural onset time and duration, distance between individuals and relative direction of motion. Response distributions of the locust furthest from the stimulus (L1) were not affected by the presence or relative position of a conspecific, whereas distributions of the closer locust (L2) were affected by its position relative to the stimulus. Motion tracks of L1 were affected by the presence of L2, which generated relatively robust responses directed forward and away from the stimulus. Translational and rotational motion of L1 differed across treatments in both experiments, whereas L2 motion was less sensitive to the presence or position of a conspecific.

The quantitative description of behavioral responses to defined stimuli has led to a rich understanding of different behavioral strategies in many species. One important navigational cue perceived by many vertebrates and insects is the e-vector orientation of linearly polarized light. Drosophila manifests an innate orientation response to this cue (‘polarotaxis’), aligning its body axis with the e-vector field. We have established a population-based behavioral paradigm for the genetic dissection of neural circuits guiding polarotaxis to both celestial as well as reflected polarized stimuli. However, the behavioral mechanisms by which flies align with a linearly polarized stimulus remain unknown. Here, we present a detailed quantitative description of Drosophila polarotaxis, systematically measuring behavioral parameters that are modulated by the stimulus. We show that angular acceleration is modulated during alignment, and this single parameter may be sufficient for alignment. Furthermore, using monocular deprivation, we show that each eye is necessary for modulating turns in the ipsilateral direction.

Lars Chittka and colleagues specifically remind us that whilst bees and other insects see in color, in complex natural environments color perception can be a challenging cue due to the large changes in the spectral quality of light in different foraging environments (Chittka et al. 2014). Anne Leonard and Pavel Masek (2014) discuss the latest evidence that bees can use multimodal information combining both color and olfactory cues to help reduce uncertainty in complex foraging conditions. Indeed there is currently a lot of interest in how bees make decisions in complex environments. Aurore Avargues-Weber and Martin Giurfa (2014) discuss that a variety of important factors like conditioning method can influence bee perception, possibly through cognitive ‘top-down’ attention-type mechanisms. Further evidence of complex decision making in bees comes from a nice study on bumblebees by Lisa Evans and Nigel Raine (2014) who show that the way in which some bees make errors may be of adaptive advantage for selecting novel rewarding colors in natural conditions. Other studies show us that since the time of von Frisch color processing has been tested in a wide variety of different insect species. Motohiro Wakakuwa and colleagues (2014) discuss photoreceptor sensitivity in the leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) which shows some behavioral sensitivity to long wavelength ‘infrared’ radiation. Francismeire Telles and colleagues (2014) show in the hummingbird hawkmoth (Macroglossum stellatarum) that the behavioral sensitivity to blue wavelength light is much higher than predicted from the retinal photoreceptor sensitivity, which may be related to the innate preference of hawkmoths for blue flowers. Besides bees, flies and butterflies have been well studied. Klaus Lunau (2014) provides a timely review on the color vision of flies which is a system generating a lot of interest at present. Michiyo Kinoshita About 100 years ago it was often thought the world might appear pretty dull for insects until the publication of Karl von Frisch in 1914. this ground breaking study by von Frisch revealed that free flying honeybees could be trained with sucrose solution to visit a colored card, and choose this stimulus correctly in tests when placed amongst a variety of grey cards. the logic of the experiment, done at a time when the spectral sensitivities of bee photoreceptors were unknown, was that if bees were only using an achromatic mechanism to find the conditioned, colored stimulus associated with a sucrose reward then the bees would make mistakes for grey cards having similar brightness values to the colored stimulus. However, the bees reliably chose the colored stimulus amongst many shades of grey (von Frisch 1914), and the eyes of the next generations of researchers were opened to the refinement and diversity of color perception in bees and other insects (Kuhn 1927; Daumer 1956; Menzel 1967; Helversen 1972; Giurfa 2004). this current year of 2014 also marks the 50th anniversary of the first publication of the spectral sensitivities of individual photoreceptor cells in the honeybee by Autrum and von Zwehl (1964), which further helped to establish honeybees as a classic model for research into insect color vision (Peitsch et al. 1992; Briscoe and Chittka 2001). In this special issue of The Journal of Comparative Physiology A, leading scientists in the field have teamed up to pay tribute to the important start Karl von Frisch gave to the field of neuroethology and insect vision with his publication in 1914.

Their information processing efficiency is enabled by the high temporal resolution of the cell membrane, requiring heavy metabolic support by the mitochondria. We studied the developmental changes of the mitochondrial apparatus and electrical properties of the photoreceptor membrane in the white eyed Calliphora vicina Chalky. Using in vivo microspectrophotometry and Western blot analysis, we found an age-dependent increase in the concentration of mitochondrial pigments. The maximal change occurred during the first week. The age-related changes were smaller in dark-bred than in light-bred flies. The mitochondrial pigment content increased after the switch from dark to light rearing and decreased after the switch from light to dark rearing. The electrical parameters of the photoreceptors were investigated with intracellular recordings. The resting membrane resistance and time constant decreased significantly after eclosion. The decrease was again most significant during the first week of adult life, paralleled with changes in the Na/K pump-dependent hyperpolarizing afterpotential.

Yet, analyses on how conditioning parameters affect color perception remained scarce. Conclusions on bee color vision have often been made without referring them to the experimental context in which they were obtained, and thus presented as absolute facts instead of realizing that subtle variations in conditioning procedures might yield different results. Here, we review evidence showing that color learning and discrimination in bees are not governed by immutable properties of their visual system, but depend on how the insects are trained and thus learn a task. The use of absolute or differential conditioning protocols, the presence of aversive reinforcement in differential conditioning and the degrees of freedom of motor components determine dramatic variations in color discrimination. We, thus, suggest top-down attentional modulation of color vision to explain the changes in color learning and discrimination reviewed here. We discuss the possible neural mechanisms of this modulation and conclude that color vision experiments require a careful consideration of how training parameters shape behavioral responses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We were interested in how these high-level stress responses are integrated at the level of the whole animal. Here, we investigated the capacity of the physiological stress response, and specifically the β-adrenergic response, to affect the induction of the cellular heat shock proteins, HSPs, following a thermal stress in vivo. We predicted that blocking β-adrenergic stimulation during an acute heat stress in the whole animal would result in reduced levels of HSPs in red blood cells (RBCs) of rainbow trout compared to animals where adrenergic signaling remained intact. We first determined that a 1 h heat shock at 25 °C in trout acclimated to 13 °C resulted in RBC adrenergic stimulation as determined by a significant increase in cell swelling, a hallmark of the β-adrenergic response. A whole animal injection with the β2-adrenergic antagonist, ICI-118,551, successfully reduced this heat-induced RBC swelling. The acute heat shock caused a significant induction of HSP70 in RBCs of 13 °C-acclimated trout as well as a significant increase in plasma catecholamines. When heat-shocked fish were treated with ICI-118,551, we observed a significant attenuation of the HSP70 response.

The current study characterized those changes in photoperiodic migratory black-headed buntings (Emberiza melanocephala), which initiate their northward spring migration in response to increasing day lengths. We measured differences in body mass, testis size and triglycerides levels in buntings between groups exposed to short (8 h light:16 h darkness, 8L:16D; SD) and long (16L:8D; LD) days, and identified proteins that showed significant differences between SD and LD in the flight muscle. To confirm that photostimulated changes were linked with migration, similar measurements were done on photoperiodic non-migratory Indian weaverbirds (Ploceus philippinus), which share the habitat with buntings for almost half-a-year. Buntings were fattened and gained weight and had elevated serum triglyceride levels and recrudesced testes under LD, but not SD. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed differences between SD and LD conditions in the flight muscle protein profiles of buntings, but not of weaverbirds. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of flight muscle of bunting separated three proteins, of which two were upregulated under LD condition. Mass spectroscopic analysis and a protein database search identified them as the fatty acid binding protein (FABP), myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK). Further semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR assays revealed that FABP and myoglobin transcript levels in buntings, but not in weaverbirds, were upregulated under LD condition. However, there was no difference in CK mRNA levels between SD and LD in both the species.

Intact animals were held by a band-clamp in a water-filled tank. Turn-swimming was evoked by slowly rotating turtles to the right or left via a motor connected to the shaft of the band-clamp. Animals executed sustained forward turn-swimming against the direction of the imposed rotation. We recorded video of turn-swimming and computer-analyzed the limb and head movements. In a subset of turtles, we also recorded electromyograms from identified limb muscles. Turning exhibited a stereotyped pattern of (1) coordinated forward swimming in the hindlimb and forelimb on the outer side of the turn, (2) back-paddling in the hindlimb on the inner side, (3) a nearly stationary, “braking” forelimb on the inner side, and (4) neck bending toward the direction of the turn.

The past 20 years have seen a renewed interest in understanding the nature of the odometer. Early work, pioneered by von Frisch and colleagues, hypothesized that travel distance is measured in terms of the energy that is consumed during the journey. More recent studies suggest that visual cues play a role as well. Specifically, bees appear to gauge travel distance by sensing the extent to which the image of the environment moves in the eye during the journey from the hive to the food source. Most of the evidence indicates that travel distance is measured during the outbound journey. Accumulation of odometric errors is restricted by resetting the odometer every time a prominent landmark is passed. When making detours around large obstacles, the odometer registers the total distance of the path that is flown to the destination, and not the “bee-line” distance. Finally, recent studies are revealing that bees can perform odometry in three dimensions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Most studies have focused on the effect of stressors on immune function, but not necessarily on trade-offs within the immune system and interactions with energy-mobilizing hormones. In this study, we examined how bactericidal ability and corticosterone interacted by applying acute restraint stress in a non-model organism, the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana), 10 days after receiving a cutaneous wound. We found a decrease in bactericidal ability in wounded animals after restraint stress. However, the percentage healed during the first 7 days was positively correlated with bactericidal ability 10 days after wounding. In addition, the magnitude of change in corticosterone concentration during the acute stress was positively correlated with the percentage of wound healing during the first 3 days. These two relationships may demonstrate a “faster is better” strategy. If energy is invested heavily in the initial wound healing stages, the individual may be able to mount a more effective immune and stress response earlier.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Impalement with an electrode causes injury to the cell and depolarization from intrusion of extracellular fluid. Thus, penetration artefacts may contaminate recordings and conceal or even alter relevant information. These penetration artefacts may have the strongest impact close to the spike-generating zone near the dendrites. Recordings in axonal portions might therefore be less vulnerable while providing insufficient information about the synaptic input. In this study, we present data of five previously identified intersegmental auditory neurons of a bushcricket independently recorded in their dendrites (prothorax) and axon (brain). Generally, responses to acoustic pulses of the same parameter combination were similar within a neuronal class at the two recording sites. However, all neuronal classes showed significantly higher response variability and a tendency for higher spike activity when recorded in the dendrites. Unexpectedly, the combined activity of two neurons (Ascending Neurons 1 and 2) recorded in the brain provides a better fit to song recognition than when recorded in the thorax. Axonal recordings of T-shaped Neuron 1 revealed graded potentials originating in the brain and modulating its output in a potentially behaviourally relevant manner.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We focus on indoor experiments on foraging individuals. Butterflies trained to visit a disk of certain color correctly select that color among various other colors and/or shades of gray. Correct selection persists under colored illumination, but is systematically shifted by background colors, indicating color constancy and simultaneous color contrast. While their eyes contain six classes of spectral receptors, their wavelength discrimination performance indicates that their color vision is tetrachromatic. P. xuthus innately prefers brighter targets, but can be trained to select dimmer ones under certain conditions. Butterflies trained to a dark red stimulus select an orange disk presented on a bright gray background over one on dark gray. The former probably appears darker to them, indicating brightness contrast. P. xuthus has a strong innate preference for vertically polarized light, but the selection of polarized light changes depending on the intensity of simultaneously presented unpolarized light. Discrimination of polarization also depends on background intensity. Similarities between brightness and polarization vision suggest that P. xuthus perceive polarization angle as brightness, such that vertical polarization appears brighter than horizontal polarization.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

At low intensity UV light of 0.3 mW/m2, birds showed normal migratory orientation by their inclination compass, with the directional information originating in radical pair processes in the eye. At 2.8 mW/m2, robins showed an axial preference in the east–west axis, whereas silvereyes preferred an easterly direction. At 5.7 mW/m2, robins changed direction to a north–south axis. When UV light was combined with yellow light, robins showed easterly ‘fixed direction’ responses, which changed to disorientation when their upper beak was locally anaesthetised with xylocaine, indicating that they were controlled by the magnetite-based receptors in the beak. Orientation under UV light thus appears to be similar to that observed under blue, turquoise and green light, albeit the UV responses occur at lower light levels, probably because of the greater light sensitivity of the UV cones. The orientation under UV light and green light suggests that at least at the level of the retina, magnetoreception and vision are largely independent of each other.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A century of subsequent research on bees’ visual and olfactory systems has developed along two productive but independent trajectories, leaving the questions of how and why bees use these two senses in concert largely unexplored. Given current interest in multimodal communication and recently discovered interplay between olfaction and vision in humans and Drosophila, understanding multisensory integration in bees is an opportunity to advance knowledge across fields. Using a classic ethological framework, we formulate proximate and ultimate perspectives on bees’ use of multisensory stimuli. We discuss interactions between scent and color in the context of bee cognition and perception, focusing on mechanistic and functional approaches, and we highlight opportunities to further explore the development and evolution of multisensory integration.

They are shaped by an organism’s environmental history and provide insights into both the global patterns of thermal sensitivity and the physiological mechanisms underlying temperature response. In this study we conducted the first measure of the thermal reaction norm for feeding, comparing the radula rasping rate of two tropical and one polar limpet species. The consistency of thermal response was tested through comparisons with limpet duration tenacity. Feeding and duration tenacity of limpets are ecologically important muscular mechanisms that rely on very different aspects of muscle physiology, repeated concentric (shortening) and isometric (fixed length) contraction of muscles, respectively. In these limpets the thermal reaction norms of feeding limpets were best described by a single break point at a maximum temperature with linear declines at higher (Siphonaria atra) or lower temperatures (Nacella concinna and Cellana radiata) rather than a bell-shaped curve. The thermal reaction norms for duration tenacity were similar in the two tropical limpets. However, the rasping rate in Antarctic N. concinna increased linearly with temperature up to a maximum at 12.3 °C (maximal range 8.5–12.3 °C) when feeding stopped. In contrast, duration tenacity in N. concinna was maximal at 1.0 °C (−0.6 to 3.8 °C) and linearly decreased with increasing temperature.

The mechanisms underlying this behaviour are little understood though one avenue of investigation is to explore how innate sensori-motor routines are used to accomplish route navigation. For instance, Australian desert ant foragers are occasionally observed to cease translation and rotate on the spot. Here, we investigate this behaviour using high-speed videography and computational analysis. We find that scanning behaviour is saccadic with pauses separated by fast rotations. Further, we have identified four situations where scanning is typically displayed: (1) by naïve ants on their first departure from the nest; (2) by experienced ants departing from the nest for their first foraging trip of the day; (3) by experienced ants when the familiar visual surround was experimentally modified, in which case frequency and duration of scans were proportional to the degree of modification; (4) when the information from visual cues is at odds with the direction indicated by the ant’s path integration system.

This negative oxygenation enthalpy (∆HO) may, however, become maladaptive, as in cold-tolerant ungulates where it may hamper O2 unloading in cold extremities and commonly is mitigated by an ‘additional’ chloride-binding site that decreases the temperature effect by increasing the endothermic release of Cl− ions upon O2 binding. Since no previous studies have focused on the consequences of reduced Cl− binding, I report and compare the enthalpic effects of chloride ions and the allosteric effector, ATP, on Hbs of the high-altitude aquatic Andean frog Telmatobius peruvianus that lacks the α-chain chloride-binding site, and the lowland (sub-)tropical frog Xenopus laevis that has retained this site and exhibits high chloride sensitivity. In contrast to Xenopus, Telmatobius Hb exhibits high temperature sensitivity (high negative ∆H′) in the presence of Cl− ions, supporting the inverse relationship between the number of Cl−-binding sites and temperature sensitivity, and extending it to ectothermic vertebrates. The radically reduced chloride binding in Telmatobius Hb permits assessment of the enthalpy of ATP binding [(∆H′ ≈ −62 kJ (mol ATP)−1 at pH 7.0]—which contrasts sharply with previously reported increases in temperature sensitivity by ATP in toad (Bufo bufo) Hb.

Here we present the RGC isodensity maps and anatomical spatial resolving power in three budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) and two Bourke’s parrots (Neopsephotus bourkii). Because RGCs were stacked in several layers, we modified the Nissl staining procedure to assess the cell number in the whole-mounted and cross-sectioned tissue of the same retinal specimen. The retinal topography showed surprising variation; however, both parrot species had an area centralis without discernable fovea. Budgerigars also had a putative area nasalis never reported in birds before. The peak RGC density was 22,300–34,200 cells/mm2 in budgerigars and 18,100–38,000 cells/mm2 in Bourke’s parrots. The maximum visual acuity based on RGCs and focal length was 6.9 cyc/deg in budgerigars and 9.2 cyc/deg in Bourke’s parrots. These results are lower than earlier behavioural estimates.

Animals of the same body mass at the slow end of the life-history continuum are characterized by low annual reproductive output and low mortality rate, such as is found in many tropical birds, whereas at the fast end, rates of reproduction and mortality are high, as in temperate birds. These differences in life-history traits are thought to result from trade-offs between investment in reproduction or self-maintenance as mediated by the biotic and abiotic environment. Thus, tropical and temperate birds provide a unique system to examine physiological consequences of life-history trade-offs at opposing ends of the “pace of life” spectrum. We have explored the implications of these trade-offs at several levels of physiological organization including whole-animal, organ systems, and cells. Tropical birds tend to have higher survival, slower growth, lower rates of whole-animal basal metabolic rate and peak metabolic rate, and smaller metabolically active organs compared with temperate birds. At the cellular level, primary dermal fibroblasts from tropical birds tend to have lower cellular metabolic rates and appear to be more resistant to oxidative cell stress than those of temperate birds. However, at the subcellular level, lipid peroxidation rates, a measure of the ability of lipid molecules within the cell membranes to thwart the propagation of oxidative damage, appear not to be different between tropical and temperate species.

Flies’ compound eyes possess an open rhabdom and thus separate rhabdomeres in each ommatidium assigned to two visual pathways. The highly sensitive, monovariant neural superposition system is based on the excitation of the peripheral rhabdomeres of the retinula cells R1–6 and controls optomotor reactions. The two forms of central rhabdomeres of R7/8 retinula cells in each ommatidium build up a system with four photoreceptors sensitive in different wavelength ranges and thought to account for colour vision. Evidence from wavelength discrimination tests suggests that all colour stimuli are assigned to one of just four colour categories, but cooperation of the two pathways is also evident. Flies use colour cues for various behavioural reactions such as flower visitation, proboscis extension, host finding, and egg deposition. Direct evidence for colour vision, the ability to discriminate colours according to spectral shape but independent of intensity, has been demonstrated for few fly species only. Indirect evidence for colour vision provided from electrophysiological recordings of the spectral sensitivity of photoreceptors and opsin genes indicates similar requisites in various flies; the flies’ responses to coloured targets, however, are much more diverse.

Estivating X. laevis reduce their metabolic rate and recruit anaerobic glycolysis, driven by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; E.C. 1.1.1.27) enzymes that reversibly convert pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NAD+, to meet newly established ATP demands. The present study investigated purified LDH from the liver of dehydrated and control X. laevis. LDH from dehydrated liver showed a significantly higher Km for l-lactate (1.74 fold), NAD+ (2.41 fold), and pyruvate (1.78 fold) in comparison to LDH from the liver of control frogs. In the presence of physiological levels of urea found in dehydrated animals, the Km values obtained for dehydrated LDH all returned to control LDH Km values. Dot blot analysis showed post-translational modifications may be responsible for the kinetic modification as the dehydrated form of LDH showed more phosphorylated serine residues (1.54 fold), less methylated lysine residues (0.43 fold), and a higher level of ubiquitination (1.90 fold) in comparison to control LDH. The physiological consequence of dehydration-induced LDH modification appears to adjust LDH function in conjunction with urea levels in dehydrated frogs.

Colour constancy is the perceptual phenomenon that the colour of an object appears largely unchanged, even if the spectral composition of the illuminating light changes. Colour constancy has been found in all insect species so far tested. Especially the pollinating insects offer a remarkable opportunity to study the ecological significance of colour constancy since they spend much of their adult lives identifying and choosing between colour targets (flowers) under continuously changing ambient lighting conditions. In bees, whose colour vision is best studied among the insects, the compensation provided by colour constancy is only partial and its efficiency depends on the area of colour space. There is no evidence for complete ‘discounting’ of the illuminant in bees, and the spectral composition of the light can itself be used as adaptive information. In patchy illumination, bees adjust their spatial foraging to minimise transitions between variously illuminated zones. Modelling allows the quantification of the adaptive benefits of various colour constancy mechanisms in the economy of nature. We also discuss the neural mechanisms and cognitive operations that might underpin colour constancy in insects.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

So far, few studies have provided a detailed spatial picture of this process, describing the properties of local dendritic activity and its subcellular organization. Here, we used 2-photon calcium imaging in optic flow processing neurons of the fly Calliphora vicina to determine the preferred location and direction of local motion cues for small branchlets throughout the entire dendrite. We found a pronounced retinotopic mapping on both the subcellular and the cell population level. In addition, dendritic branchlets residing in different layers of the neuropil were tuned to distinct directions of motion. Summing the local receptive fields of all dendritic branchlets reproduced the characteristic properties of these neurons’ axonal output receptive fields. Our results corroborate the notion that the dendritic morphology of vertical system cells allows them to selectively collect local motion inputs with particular directional preferences from a spatially organized input repertoire, thus forming filters that match global patterns of optic flow. Furthermore, we suggest that the facet arrangement across the fly’s eye shapes the subcellular direction tuning to local motion stimuli. These data illustrate a highly structured circuit organization as an efficient way to hard-wire a complex sensory task.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We manipulated the available celestial cues for compass orientation for ants that had arrived at a feeder, were captured and then released at a distant test site that had no useful terrestrial panoramic cues. When tested in an enclosed transparent box that blocked some or most of the ultraviolet light, the ants were still well oriented homewards. The ants were again significantly oriented homewards when most of the ultraviolet light as well as the sun was blocked, or when the box was covered with tracing paper that eliminated the pattern of polarised light, although in the latter case, their headings were more scattered than in control (full-cue) conditions. When the position of the sun was reflected 180° by a mirror, the ants headed off in an intermediate direction between the dictates of the sun and the dictates of unrotated cues. We conclude that M. bagoti uses all available celestial compass cues, including the pattern of polarised light, the position of the sun, and spectral and intensity gradients. They average multiple cues in a weighted fashion when these cues conflict.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Simultaneously, we performed electromyographic recordings (EMGs) of the hind leg claw retractor muscle that partly controls the attachment structures. On both substrates, hind legs produced upward- as well as downward-directed forces during one stance phase. Forces were equivalent in both directions. Front legs generated only upward-directed forces. The main function of hind legs in ascending beetles in the second half of the stance thus probably prevented the animals from tilting away from the substrate. The EMGs of hind legs showed an early spike during stance with large amplitude. It was mostly followed by few additional spikes with large amplitude and in some cases of spikes with smaller amplitude distributed throughout the stance phase. We found significantly more spikes on the rough substrate than on the smooth one. This is probably due to the more important role of pretarsal claws than tarsal hairy attachment pads on the rough substrate or to the reduced adhesive forces on the rough substrate that have to be compensated by additional muscle activity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In a previous study of the phototaxis of green rice leafhoppers, Nephotettix cincticeps (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae), we found positive responses to 735 nm light. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying this sensitivity to near-infrared light. We first measured the action spectrum using a Y-maze with monochromatic lights from 480 to 740 nm. We thus found that the action spectrum peaks at 520 nm in the tested wavelength range, but that a significant effect is still observed at 740 nm, albeit with a sensitivity 5 log units lower than the peak. Second, we measured the spectral sensitivity of the eye, and found that the sensitivity in the long-wavelength region parallels the behaviorally determined action spectrum. We further identified mRNAs encoding opsins of ultraviolet, blue, and green-absorbing visual pigments, and localized the mRNAs in the ommatidia by in situ hybridization. The electrophysiology, molecular biology and the anatomy of the eye together indicate that the eyes of N. cincticeps do not contain true “red” receptors, but rather that the behavioral response to near-infrared light is mediated by the tail sensitivity of the green receptors in the long-wavelength region of the spectrum.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Yet, despite this remarkable hardiness, basic information on how this species responds physiologically to emersion is somewhat lacking. Using flow-through respirometry and electrophysiological techniques, we identified that J. edwardsii undergoes marked physiological changes during rest, emersion and recovery over a broad range of temperatures (3.7–17.8 °C). Under resting conditions, routine metabolic rates (RMR) were 22.57 ± 2.39, 9.69 ± 0.55 and 8.09 ± 0.27 mL O2 h−1, average heart rates (Hr) were 54.72 ± 4.46, 37.68 ± 2.86 and 29.67 ± 0.59 BPM, and ventilation frequencies were 83.71 ± 5.86, 45.34 ± 2.91 and 41.62 ± 0.65 BPM at 15.0, 7.5 and 3.7 °C, respectively. Notably, the surgical implantation of electrodes elevated RMR compared with non-surgical treatments. In surgery and non-surgery groups, Q10 was calculated to be ca. 3.0. Upon emersion, rate of oxygen consumption and Hr decreased below resting rates in a temperature-dependent manner, but, along with rate of CO2 production, increased steadily during 24-h emersion. Ventilation frequencies upon emersion showed a contrasting response and increased significantly above resting rates. When returned to flow-through sea water for recovery, elevated respiration rates provided clear evidence of an O2 debt, and near-complete recovery was observed after 17 h at both 15.0 and 7.5 °C, but close to no debt was recovered at 3.7 °C. In addition, J. edwardsii was observed to undergo marked diurnal and periodic ventilation cycles, characterised by synchronous changes in RMR, Hr and ventilation frequency.

To assess the influence of CO2 on physiological control of dive behaviour, we tested how increasing levels of inspired CO2 (hypercarbia) and decreasing inspired O2 (hypoxia) affected the diving metabolic rate, submergence times, and dive recovery times (time to replenish O2 stores and eliminate CO2) of freely diving Steller sea lions. We also measured changes in breathing frequency of diving and non-diving individuals. Our findings show that hypercarbia increased breathing frequency (as low as 2 % CO2), but did not affect metabolic rate, or the duration of dives or surface intervals (up to 3 % CO2). Changes in breathing rates indicated respiratory drive was altered by hypercarbia at rest, but blood CO2 levels remained below the threshold that would alter normal dive behaviour. It took the sea lions longer to remove accumulated CO2 than it did for them to replenish their O2 stores following dives (whether breathing ambient air, hypercarbia, or hypoxia). This difference between O2 and CO2 recovery times grew with increasing dive durations, increasing hypercarbia, and was greater for bout dives, suggesting there could be a build-up of CO2 load with repeated dives. Although we saw no evidence of CO2 limiting dive behaviour, the longer time required to remove CO2 may eventually exhibit control over the overall time they can spend in apnoea and overall foraging duration.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Fasted and fed herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), omnivorous channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and carnivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were compared for digestive organ masses, intestinal morphology, gastrointestinal pH, and the specific activities and total intestinal capacities of the intestinal hydrolases aminopeptidase (APN) and maltase and intestinal nutrient transporters. All three species experience intestinal hypertrophy with feeding as noted by significant increases in enterocyte dimensions. Of the three, only I. punctatus experienced a postprandial increase in intestinal length, and only C. idella experienced significant modulation of intestinal microvillus length. Feeding resulted in acidification of the stomachs of I. punctatus and M. salmoides. Predicted to exhibit a relatively modest set of postprandial responses because of their more frequent feeding habits, C. idella only experienced increases in APN and maltase activity with feeding and no significant regulation of nutrient uptake. Significant regulation of hydrolase activities and nutrient uptake were exhibited by I. punctatus and M. salmoides, with I. punctatus experiencing the most comprehensive set of responses. As predicted by food habits, there was an interspecific gradient in intestinal length and glucose uptake extending from longer intestines and greater glucose uptake for the herbivorous C. idella, intermediate lengths and glucose uptake for the omnivorous I. punctatus, and shorter intestines and reduced glucose uptake for the carnivorous M. salmoides.

Behavioral experiments in bees and ants, indeed, showed that direct sunlight and sky polarization play a role in sky compass orientation, but the relative importance of these cues are species-specific. Intracellular recordings from polarization-sensitive interneurons in the desert locust and monarch butterfly suggest that inputs from different eye regions, including polarized-light input through the dorsal rim area of the eye and chromatic/intensity gradient input from the main eye, are combined at the level of the medulla to create a robust compass signal. Conflicting input from the polarization and chromatic/intensity channel, resulting from eccentric receptive fields, is eliminated at the level of the anterior optic tubercle and central complex through internal compensation for changing solar elevations, which requires input from a circadian clock. Across several species, the central complex likely serves as an internal sky compass, combining E-vector information with other celestial cues. Descending neurons, likewise, respond both to zenithal polarization and to unpolarized cues in an azimuth-dependent way.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The gecarcinids are detritivores that consume mainly leaf litter; the robber crab, B. latro, is an omnivore that preferentially consumes items high in lipid, carbohydrate and/or protein; C. perlatus is also an omnivore/detritivore. All species possess protease, lipase and amylase activity for hydrolysing ubiquitous protein, lipid and storage polysaccharides (glycogen and starch). Similarly all species possess enzymes such as N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, the cellulases, endo-β-1,4-glucanase and β-glucohydrolase and hemicellulases, lichenase and laminarinase for the respective hydrolysis of structural substrates chitin, cellulose and hemicelluloses, lichenan and laminarin.

Perhaps others factors such as olfactory and locomotor ability and metabolic status may determine the observed dietary preferences.

Thus, C. perlatus may be efficient at digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose within plant material. Zymography indicated that the majority of protease, lipase, phosphatase, amylase, endo-β-1,4-glucanase, β-glucohydrolase and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase isozymes were common to all species, and hence were inherited from a common aquatic ancestor.

The relative transcript levels of GLUTs 1–4 were determined in tissues of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The distribution profile of GLUTs normalized to RNA is similar to mammals and with a few exceptions other fish. GLUT1 is ubiquitous, GLUT2 is relatively abundant in tissues that release glucose, GLUT3 expression is relatively strong in brain, and GLUT4 is relatively high in heart and muscle. The functionally significant level of transcript is presumably the level in the cell. Normalization of relative GLUT levels to tissue mass reveals there are extremely high levels of GLUT1 transcript in gas gland consistent with the high lactate production rates, GLUT3 is dominant in gill and head kidney as well as brain, and GLUT4 expression in gill is elevated relative to other tissues. Consideration of GLUTs within tissues reveals that GLUT1 is the dominant transcript in a group of tissues including gas gland, heart, white muscle, and RBCs. Brain, gill, and spleen display a co-dominance of GLUTs 1 and 3. There are relatively low levels of GLUT4 in most tissues, the highest being found in white muscle where GLUT4 accounts for only 12 % of the total transcript level. The apparent low level of GLUT4 transcript may reflect two tissues that were not included in the current study, red muscle and adipose tissue, due to their low abundance in Atlantic cod.

To determine the behavioural spectral sensitivity (action spectrum) of foraging moths, we trained animals to associate a disk illuminated with spectral light, with a food reward, and a dark disk with no reward. While the spectral positions of sensitivity maxima found in behavioural tests agree with model predictions based on the ERG data, the sensitivity to blue light was 30 times higher than expected. This is different from the honeybee but similar to earlier findings in the crepuscular hawkmoth Manduca sexta. It may indicate that the action spectrum of foraging hawkmoths does not represent their general sensory capacity.

In this study, white-footed mice from wild-derived photoresponsive [R, infertile in short day length (SD)] and non-photoresponsive (NR, fertile in SD) selection lines were maintained under short-day (SD 8Light:16Dark), sub-thermoneutral conditions (22 or 12 °C). Mice had significantly higher levels of food intake and resting metabolic rates (RMR) at low temperature. RMR differed significantly between lines (greater in NR mice). In contrast to previous work under thermoneutral conditions, there was no significant difference in overall activity or average daily metabolic rates (ADMR) of mice from the two lines. Reduced activity may reflect behavioral changes under cooler conditions (e.g., nest building) reducing the overall energetic cost of fertility (for NR mice). There was no significant difference in maximal rate of oxygen consumption ($$\dot V \text{O}_{\text {2max}} $$V˙O2max) between lines. R mice had significantly greater brown adipose tissue and white abdominal fat mass due to both line and temperature. Reaction norms for intake, resting metabolism (RMR/BMR) and level of activity from current (12 and 22 °C) and previously published data (28 °C) demonstrate independent effects of genetics (line) and environment (temperature) for resting metabolism, but a clear interaction between these for activity. The results suggest that fertility under winter conditions imposes metabolic costs that are related to the level of reproductive development. Under the coldest conditions tested, however, mice that remained fertile in SD reduced activity, ADMR and food requirements, decreasing the differential between selection lines. Heritable variation in reaction norms suggests a genetic by environment effect that could be subject to selection.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

When the crabs were offered a meal of fish, shrimp, or mussel of 3 % of their body mass the duration of the SDA response and thus the resultant SDA was lower for the mussel, compared with the shrimp or fish meals. In feeding behaviour experiments the crabs consumed almost twice as much mussel compared with fish or shrimp. When the animals were allowed to feed on each meal until satiated, the differences in the SDA response were abolished. The mussel was much softer (compression test) than the fish or shrimp meal, and meal texture is known to affect the SDA response in amphibians and reptiles. When the crabs were offered a meal of homogenized fish muscle or whole fish muscle, the SDA for the homogenized meal was approximately 35 % lower. This suggested that a significant portion of the SDA budget in decapod crustaceans may be related to mechanical digestion. This is not unexpected since the foregut is supplied by over forty muscles which control the cutting and grinding movements of the gastric mill apparatus. There were slight, but significant differences in protein, lipid, moisture and total energy content of each meal type. Three prepared meals that were high in either protein, lipid or carbohydrate were offered to the crabs to determine if the nutrient content was also a contributing factor to the observed differences in the SDA. The crabs did not eat the prepared meals as readily as the natural food items and as they are messy feeders there was a large variation in the amount of food eaten. The lack of significant differences in the SDA response as a function of nutrient content was likely due to differences in amount of food eaten, which is a major factor determining the SDA response. The differences in SDA when consuming natural food items were likely due to a combination of the costs of mechanical digestion, variation in nutrient content and food preference: determining how each of these factors contributes to the overall SDA budget remains a pressing question for comparative physiologists.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Honeybee foragers were differentially trained to discriminate between rewarded (S+) and unrewarded (S−) colors and tested on responses toward the former S+ when presented against a novel color. A color space based on the receptor noise-limited model was used to evaluate the relationship between colors and to characterize a perceptual continuum. When S+ was tested against a novel color occupying a locus in the color space located in the same direction from S− as S+, but further away, the bees shifted their stronger response away from S− toward the novel color.

To verify the antioxidant capacity of HA, total phenolic compounds were measured. In general, all tissues of silver catfish exposed simultaneously to hypoxia and different HA concentrations showed a reduction in lipid peroxidation levels, as well as a modulation of the antioxidant system. These effects occurred in an HA concentration-dependent manner. Thus, HA is beneficial to silver catfish exposed to hypoxia.

Since that time a wealth of quality physiological data has shown a highly conserved set of trichromatic colour receptors in most bee species. Despite the subsequent wealth of behavioural research on honeybees and bumblebees, there currently is a relative dearth of data on stingless bees, which are the largest tribe of the eusocial bees comprising of more than 600 species. In our first experiment we tested Trigona cf. fuscipennis, a stingless bee species from Costa Rica in a field setting using the von Frisch method and show functional colour vision. In a second experiment with these bees, we use a simultaneous colour discrimination test designed for honeybees to enable a comparative analysis of relative colour discrimination. In a third experiment, we test in laboratory conditions Tetragonula carbonaria, an Australian stingless bee species using a similar simultaneous colour discrimination test. Both stingless bee species show relatively poorer colour discrimination

Thus, here we demonstrate a way of easily reproducing this phenomenon in a laboratory setting and characterize the cardiac electromechanical alterations during TI. We observed a significant decrease in heart rate (HR) and changes of rhythm in electrocardiogram during TI in rabbits. Echocardiogram showed a significant increase in the left ventricle chamber diameter during systole and a consequent decrease in fractional shortening and ejection fraction, in addition to the HR and rhythm changes. There was also a significant decrease in aortic and pulmonary artery blood flow. Diastolic functional changes included a significant decrease of the peak atrial contraction velocity (A peak) and consequent increase in the ratio of peak early diastolic velocity to A peak and increased isovolumetric relaxation time. We were able to prove that TI changes the cardiac function considerably. Although the “fight-or-flight” response is the most common response to fear, which is characterized by the action of sympathetic nervous system with tachycardia and increased physical activity, TI is an alternative anti-predator behavior causing cardiac changes opposite to the “fight-or-flight” phenomenon.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hypoxia and anoxia are a normal part of their developmental environment. Here, we exposed embryos to a range of PO2 levels at two different temperatures (25 and 30 °C) to study the combined effects of reduced oxygen and increased temperature on developmental rate, heart rate, and metabolic enzyme capacity. Hypoxia decreased overall developmental rate and caused a stage-specific decline in heart rate. However, the rate of early development prior to the onset of organogenesis is insensitive to PO2. Increased incubation temperature caused an increase in the developmental rate at high PO2s, but hindered developmental progression under severe hypoxia. Embryonic DNA content in pre-hatching embryos was positively correlated with PO2. Citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase capacity were all reduced in embryos developing under hypoxic conditions. Embryos of A. limnaeus are able to develop normally across a wide range of PO2s and contrary to most other vertebrates severe hypoxia is not a teratogen. Embryos of A. limnaeus do not respond to hypoxia through an increase in the capacity for enzymatic activity of the metabolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Instead they appear to adjust whole-embryo metabolic capacity to match oxygen availability. However, decreased DNA content in hypoxia-reared embryos suggests that cellular enzymatic capacity may remain unchanged in response to hypoxia, and the reduced capacity may rather indicate reduced cell number in hypoxic embryos.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We investigated the role of parasympathetic reflex vasodilation in the regulation of the cerebral hemodynamics, and whether GABAA receptors modulate the response. We examined the effects of activation of the parasympathetic fibers through trigeminal afferent inputs on blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICABF) and the cerebral blood vessels (rCBF) in parietal cortex in urethane-anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the lingual nerve (LN) elicited intensity- and frequency-dependent increases in ICABF that were independent of changes in external carotid artery blood flow. Increases in ICABF were elicited by LN stimulation regardless of the presence or absence of sympathetic innervation. The ICABF increases evoked by LN stimulation were almost abolished by the intravenous administration of hexamethonium (10 mg kg−1) and were reduced significantly by atropine administration (0.1 mg kg−1). Although the LN stimulation alone had no significant effect on rCBF, LN stimulation in combination with a blocker of the GABAA receptor pentylenetetrazole increased the rCBF markedly. This increase in rCBF was reduced significantly by the administration of hexamethonium and atropine. These observations indicate that the increases in both ICABF and rCBF are evoked by parasympathetic activation via the trigeminal-mediated reflex. The rCBF increase evoked by LN stimulation is thought to be limited by the GABAA receptors in the central nervous system. These results suggest that the parasympathetic reflex vasodilation and its modulation mediated by GABA receptors within synaptic transmission in the brainstem are involved in the regulation of the cerebral hemodynamics during trigeminal afferent inputs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

While research has predominantly focused on hypoxia-sensitive mammals as surrogates for humans, the use of animals which have naturally evolved anoxia tolerance has been largely ignored. Remarkably, some animals can live in the complete absence of O2 for days, months and even years, but surprisingly little is currently known about mitochondrial function in these species. In contrast to mammals, mitochondrial function in anoxia-tolerant animals is relatively insensitive to in vitro anoxia and reoxygenation, suggesting that anoxia tolerance transcends to the level of the mitochondria. Furthermore, long-term anoxia is associated with marked changes in the intrinsic properties of the mitochondria from these species, which may afford protection against anoxia-related damage. In the present review, we highlight some of the strategies anoxia-tolerant animals possess to preserve mitochondrial function in the absence of O2. Specifically, we review mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation, proton leak, redox signaling and mitochondrial permeability transition, in phylogenetically diverse groups of anoxia-tolerant animals. From the strategies they employ, these species emerge as model organisms to illuminate novel interventions to mitigate O2-related mitochondrial dysfunction in humans.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We compared the phospholipid and cholesterol composition of liver and brain plasma membranes in the freeze-tolerant wood frog, Rana sylvatica, from southern Ohio and Interior Alaska during summer, fall, and winter. We also compared membranes from winter-acclimatized frogs from Ohio that were either acclimated to 0, 4, or 10 °C, or frozen to −2.5 °C and sampled before or after thawing. Lipids were extracted from isolated membranes, separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, and analyzed via densitometry. Liver membranes underwent seasonal changes in phospholipid composition and lipid ratios, including a winter increase in phosphatidylethanolamine, which serves to increase fluidity. However, whereas Ohioan frogs decreased phosphatidylcholine and increased sphingomyelin, Alaskan frogs only decreased phosphatidylserine, indicating that these phenotypes use different adaptive strategies to meet the functional needs of their membranes. Liver membranes showed no seasonal variation in cholesterol abundance, though membranes from Alaskan frogs contained relatively less cholesterol, consistent with the need for greater fluidity in a colder environment. No lipid changed seasonally in brain membranes in either population. In the thermal acclimation experiment, cold exposure induced an increase in phosphatidylethanolamine in liver membranes and a decrease in cholesterol in brain membranes. No changes occurred during freezing and thawing in membranes from either organ.

Frequency-dependent directionality in the amplitude and phase of tympanum vibrations,"Anuran ears function as pressure difference receivers, and the amplitude and phase of tympanum vibrations are inherently directional, varying with sound incident angle. We quantified the nature of this directionality for Cope’s gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. We presented subjects with pure tones, advertisement calls, and frequency-modulated sweeps to examine the influence of frequency, signal level, lung inflation, and sex on ear directionality. Interaural differences in the amplitude of tympanum vibrations were 1–4 dB greater than sound pressure differences adjacent to the two tympana, while interaural differences in the phase of tympanum vibration were similar to or smaller than those in sound phase. Directionality in the amplitude and phase of tympanum vibration were highly dependent on sound frequency, and directionality in amplitude varied slightly with signal level. Directionality in the amplitude and phase of tone- and call-evoked responses did not differ between sexes. Lung inflation strongly affected tympanum directionality over a narrow frequency range that, in females, included call frequencies.

We applied two complementary methodologies, open and closed loop playback trials, to identify influences on localization abilities in Cope’s gray treefrog, Hylachrysoscelis. We examined localization acuity and phonotaxis behavior of females in response to advertisement calls presented from 12 azimuthal angles, at two signal levels, in the presence and absence of noise, and at two noise levels. Orientation responses were consistent with precise localization of sound sources, rather than binary discrimination between sources on either side of the body (lateralization). Frogs were unable to discriminate between sounds arriving from forward and rearward directions, and accurate localization was limited to forward sound presentation angles. Within this region, sound presentation angle had little effect on localization acuity. The presence of noise and low signal-to-noise ratios also did not strongly impair localization ability in open loop trials, but females exhibited reduced phonotaxis performance consistent with impaired localization during closed loop trials.

Ideally, however, mate choice designs should reflect natural conditions, including the physical properties of the transmission channel for the signal. Since little is known about the discrimination ability of females between male song variants under natural conditions, we performed phonotaxis experiments with female field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) outdoors, using two-choice decisions based on differences in carrier frequency, sound pressure level, and chirp rate. For all three song parameters, minimum differences necessary for a significant preference between two song models were considerably larger outdoors compared to laboratory conditions. A minimum amplitude difference of 5 dB was required for a significant choice in the field, compared to only 1–2 dB reported for lab-based experiments. Due to the tuned receiver system, differences in carrier frequency equal differences in perceived loudness, and the results on choice for differences in carrier frequency corroborate those in amplitude. Similarly, chirp rate differences of 50 chirps/min were required outdoors compared to only 20 chirps/min in the lab. For predictions about patterns of sexual selection, future studies need to consider the different outcomes of mate choice decisions in lab and field trials.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We assessed the intraspecific mass scaling of standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), and erythrocyte size in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), with body masses ranging from 4.0 to 459 g. SMR and MMR scaled with body mass with similar exponents, but neither exponent matched the expected value of 0.75 or 1, respectively. Erythrocyte size scaled with body mass with a very low exponent (0.090), suggests that while both cell number and cell size contribute to the increase in body mass, cell size plays a smaller role. The similar slopes of MMR and SMR in grass carp suggest a constant factorial aerobic scope (FAS) as the body grows. 
SMR was negatively correlated with FAS, indicating a tradeoff between SMR and FAS. Smaller fish recovered faster from the exhaustive exercises, and the scaling exponent of EPOC was 1.075, suggesting a nearly isometric increase in anaerobic capacity. Our results provide support for the cell size model and suggest that variations of erythrocyte size may partly contribute to the intraspecific scaling of SMR. The scaling exponent of MMR was 0.863, suggesting that the metabolism of non-athletic fish species is less reliant on muscular energy expenditure, even during strenuous exercise.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Once food is available, animals use external energy to restore their depressed functional performance. In the present study, the physiological and morphological responses to the first bout of refeeding in juvenile southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) were characterized. Fish that had undergone long-term fasting (fasted for 32 days, the S32 group) exhibited a lower resting metabolic rate ($$ {\dot{\text{M}}} $$M˙O2rest decreased by 49 %), lower peak metabolic rate ($$ {\dot{\text{M}}} $$M˙O2peak decreased by 24 %), greater energy expenditure (increased by 15 %) during specific dynamic action (SDA) and longer duration SDA response (increased by 41 %) than those of a control group (S0 group, fasted for 0 days).

The S0 group also had a shorter gastric evacuation time (36 h) than either of the two fasting groups (both 64 h). The S32 group displayed a higher minimum gastric pH (3.1) than the S0 and S16 groups (2.6). Refeeding did not trigger an increase in the wet mass of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the liver wet mass of the S0 and the two fasting groups increased significantly with refeeding. The trypsin and lipase of the S0 group showed higher mass-specific activities and organ capacities than either of the two fasting groups at certain specific time points. A similar result was found for aminopeptidase activity. Multiple loach meals equaling 6 % of the body weight of the fed fish completely restored the liver morphology within the S16 but not the S32 group.

The objectives were to characterize the effects of sound frequency, sound pressure level, and subject sex and body size on ABRs. The ABR in gray treefrogs bore striking resemblance to ABRs measured in other animals. As stimulus level increased, ABR amplitude increased and latency decreased, and for responses to tones, these effects depended on stimulus frequency. Frequency-dependent differences in ABRs were correlated with expected differences in the tuning of two sensory end organs in the anuran inner ear (the amphibian and basilar papillae). The ABR audiogram indicated two frequency regions of increased sensitivity corresponding to the expected tuning of the two papillae.

Although two fatty acids (FA) 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3 are essential membrane components, they are sparingly synthesized by bivalves and must be obtained from their diet. Here, effects of dietary modifications of membrane lipid composition were studied at both cellular and subcellular levels in the oyster Crassostrea gigas. To this end, we compared oysters fed two monoalgal diets that differed markedly in their FA composition and a mix of both. As expected, algae impacted phospholipids, in particular 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3, reflecting differences of dietary microalgae FA composition. Meantime, total saturated FA, total monounsaturated FA, total polyunsaturated FA and total non-methylene-interrupted FA varied little and phospholipid class composition was only slightly affected by diets. Measures made in hemocytes indicated that only mitochondrial membrane potential was affected by diets. Total ROS production as well as mitochondrial superoxide production did not differ with diet.

Similarly, neither cytochromes a, b, c or c1 content nor citrate synthase activities were changed, suggesting that number and morphology of mitochondria were not affected by dietary treatment. These results suggest that oysters could possess high homeostatic capabilities, at both cellular and subcellular levels, to minimize the effect of dietary FA and related membrane lipid FA modifications on mitochondrial functions.

We further demonstrated pronounced seasonal (summer vs. winter [i.e., interbout] euthermia) changes in respiration rates in both mitochondrial subpopulations in this tissue, consistent with a shift in fuel use away from carbohydrates and proteins and towards fatty acids and ketones. By contrast, these seasonal changes in respiration rates were not observed in either SS or IM mitochondria isolated from hind limb skeletal muscle. Both populations of skeletal muscle mitochondria, however, did exhibit metabolic suppression during torpor, and this suppression was 2- to 3-fold greater in IM mitochondria, which provide ATP for Ca2+- and myosin ATPases, the activities of which are likely quite low in skeletal muscle during torpor because animals are immobile.

One potential regulator of these seasonal phenotypes is myostatin, a muscle growth inhibitor, which may be downregulated under conditions promoting increased energy demand. We examined summer-to-winter variation in skeletal muscle and heart masses and used qPCR and Western blots to measure levels of myostatin and its metalloproteinase activators TLL-1 and TLL-2 for two small temperate-zone resident birds, American goldfinches (Spinus tristis) and black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). Winter pectoralis and heart masses were significantly greater than in summer for American goldfinches. Neither myostatin expression nor protein levels differed significantly between seasons for goldfinch pectoralis. However, myostatin levels in goldfinch heart were significantly greater in summer than in winter, although heart myostatin expression was seasonally stable. In addition, expression of both metalloproteinase activators was greater in summer than in winter goldfinches for both pectoralis and heart, significantly so except for heart TLL-2 (P = 0.083). Black-capped chickadees showed no significant seasonal variation in muscle or heart masses. Seasonal patterns of pectoralis and heart expression and/or protein levels for myostatin and its metalloproteinase activators in chickadees showed no consistent seasonal trends, which may help explain the absence of significant seasonal variation in muscle or heart masses for chickadees in this study.

In this study, various 5-HT agonists and antagonists were employed to determine which 5-HT receptor subtypes are responsible for the positive chronotropic effect by 5-HT. The pharmacological results demonstrate that a 5-HT2B agonist significantly increases the heart rate; however, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT7 agonists do not have a significant effect on the heart rate. Furthermore, 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, markedly reduces the positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT in a dose–response manner. Furthermore, we employed genetic approaches to confirm the pharmacological results. For this purpose, we used RNA interference line to knock down 5-HT2ADro and also used 5-HT2ADro and 5-HT2BDro insertional mutation lines.

The polar bear and marsupial koala compared,"The furs of mammals have varied and complex functions. Other than for thermoregulation, fur is involved in physical protection, sensory input, waterproofing and colouration, the latter being important for crypsis or camouflage. Some of these diverse functions potentially conflict. We have investigated how variation in cryptic colouration and thermal features may interact in the coats of mammals and influence potential heat inflows from solar radiation, much of which is outside the visible spectral range. The coats of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the marsupial koala (Phascolarctus cinereus) have insulative similarities but, while they feature cryptic colouration, they are of contrasting colour, i.e. whitish and dark grey. The reflectance of solar radiation by coats was measured across the full solar spectrum using a spectroradiometer. The modulation of incident solar radiation and resultant heat flows in these coats were determined at a range of wind speeds by mounting them on a heat flux transducer/temperature-controlled plate apparatus in a wind tunnel. A lamp with a spectral distribution of radiation similar to the solar spectrum was used as a proxy for the sun. Crypsis by colour matching was apparent within the visible spectrum for the two species, U. maritimus being matched against snow and P. cinereus against Eucalyptus forest foliage. While reflectances across the full solar spectrum differed markedly, that of U. maritimus being 66 % as opposed to 10 % for P. cinereus, the heat influxes from solar radiation reaching the skin were similar. For both coats at low wind speed (1 m s−1), 19 % of incident solar radiation impacted as heat at the skin surface; at higher wind speed (10 m s−1) this decreased to approximately 10 %. Ursus maritimus and P. cinereus have high and comparable levels of fur insulation and although the patterns of reflectance and depths of penetrance of solar radiation differ for the coats, the considerable insulation limited the radiant heat reaching the skin. These data suggest that generally, if mammal coats have high insulation then heat flow from solar radiation into an animal is much restricted and the impact of coat colour is negligible. However, comparisons with published data from other species suggest that as fur insulation decreases, colour increasingly influences the heat inflow associated with solar radiation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In daylight conditions, birds use colour vision to discriminate large objects such as fruit and plumage patches, and luminance vision to detect fine spatial detail and motion. However, decreasing light intensity favours achromatic mechanisms and eventually, in dim light, luminance vision outperforms colour vision in all visual tasks. We have used behavioural tests in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to investigate how single cones, double cones and rods contribute to spectral sensitivity for large (3.4°) static monochromatic stimuli at light intensities ranging from 0.08 to 63.5 cd/m2. We found no influences of rods at any intensity level. Single cones dominate the spectral sensitivity function at intensities above 1.1 cd/m2, as predicted by a receptor noise-limited colour discrimination model. Below 1.1 cd/m2, spectral sensitivity is lower than expected at all wavelengths except 575 nm, which corresponds to double cone function. We suggest that luminance vision mediated by double cones restores visual sensitivity when single cone sensitivity quickly decreases at light intensities close to the absolute threshold of colour vision.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Additionally, previous investigations have revealed that chronic elevations of plasma cortisol mediate changes in brain 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and protein levels via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR); thus, we hypothesized that the function of centrally activated 5-HT1A receptors is reduced or abolished as a result of chronically elevated plasma cortisol levels and that this response is GR mediated. Our results are the first to demonstrate that intravenous injection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, stimulates a significant increase in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) precursor mRNA expression in the hypothalamic region and the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary of teleost fish compared to saline-injected controls.

Sparse neuronal codes are often invariant to changes in stimulus intensity and duration, and sparse coding often depends on global inhibition. We tested if this is the case for honeybees’ Kenyon cells, too, and used in vivo Ca2+ imaging to record their responses to different odorant concentrations. Kenyon cells responded not only to the onset of odorant stimuli (ON responses), but also to their termination (OFF responses). Both, ON and OFF responses increased with increasing odorant concentration. ON responses were phasic and invariant to the duration of odorant stimuli, while OFF responses increased with increasing odorant duration. Pharmacological blocking of GABA receptors in the brain revealed that ionotropic GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptors attenuate Kenyon cells’ ON responses without changing their OFF responses. Ionotropic GABAA receptors attenuated Kenyon cell ON responses more strongly than metabotropic GABAB receptors. However, the response dynamic, temporal resolution and paired-pulse depression did not depend on GABAA transmission. These data are discussed in the context of mechanisms leading to sparse coding in Kenyon cells.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Eupsophus emiliopugini, an anuran from the temperate austral forest communicates by means of an advertisement call of moderate intensity within the range for anurans. To estimate the range over which these frogs communicate effectively, we conducted measurements of call sound levels and of auditory thresholds to pure tones and to synthetic conspecific calls. The results show that E. emiliopugini produces advertisement calls of about 84 dB SPL at 0.25 m from the caller. The signals are affected by attenuation as they propagate, reaching average values of about 47 dB SPL at 8 m from the sound source. Midbrain multi-unit recordings show quite sensitive audiograms within the anuran range, with thresholds of about 44 dB SPL for synthetic imitations of conspecific calls, which would allow communication at distances beyond 8 m. This is an extended range as compared to E. calcaratus, a related syntopic species for which a previous study has shown to be restricted to active acoustic spaces shorter than 2 m. The comparison reveals divergent strategies for related taxa communicating amid the same environment.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These embryos can survive environmental and cellular conditions that would likely result in death in the majority of vertebrate cells, despite experiencing a massive loss of ATP. It is highly likely that the initial response to anoxia must quickly alter cellular physiology to reprogram cell signaling and metabolic pathways to support anaerobiosis. Covalent protein modifications are a mechanism that can quickly act to effect large-scale changes in protein structure and function and have been suggested by others to play a key role in mammalian ischemia tolerance. Using Western blot analysis, we explored patterns of protein ubiquitylation and SUMOylation in embryos of A. limnaeus exposed to anoxia and anoxic preconditioning. Surprisingly, we report stage-specific protein ubiquitylation patterns that suggest different mechanisms for altering protein turnover in dormant and actively developing embryos that both survive long-term anoxia. Anoxic preconditioning does not appear to alter levels of ubiquitin conjugates in a unique manner. Global SUMOylation of proteins does not change in response to anoxia, but there are stage-specific changes in SUMOylation of specific protein bands. Contrary to other systems, global changes in protein SUMOylation may not be required to support long-term tolerance to anoxia in embryos of A. limnaeus. These data lead us to conclude that embryos of A. limnaeus respond to anoxia in a unique manner compared to other vertebrate models of anoxia tolerance and may provide novel mechanisms for engineering vertebrate tissues to survive long-term anoxia.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To determine their walking direction they use primarily celestial cues, the sky’s polarization pattern and the sun position. To examine the relative importance of these two celestial cues, we performed cue conflict experiments. We manipulated the polarization pattern experienced by the ants during their outbound foraging excursions, reducing it to a single electric field (e-)vector direction with a linear polarization filter. The simultaneous view of the sun created situations in which the directional information of the sun and the polarization compass disagreed. The heading directions of the homebound runs recorded on a test field with full view of the natural sky demonstrate that none of both compasses completely dominated over the other. Rather the ants seemed to compute an intermediate homing direction to which both compass systems contributed roughly equally. Direct sunlight and polarized light are detected in different regions of the ant’s compound eye, suggesting two separate pathways for obtaining directional information. In the experimental paradigm applied here, these two pathways seem to feed into the path integrator with similar weights.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Previous studies have shown that male vocal activity varies both seasonally and daily in this species and that females use male advertisement calls to locate and select mates. The present results show that both EEG and locomotor activity exhibit highly correlated circadian patterns with peaks around light onset and offset. Importantly, during the reproductive stage, statistically significant sex differences in EEG output across brain regions during the light and dark phases were found indicating that sexual dimorphism exists for EEG activity which may underlie sexually specific information processing and behavioral activities.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested the hypothesis that increased desiccation resistance in acclimated flies is associated with changes in cuticular permeability and/or content of energy metabolites that act as osmolytes. Under an ecologically relevant humidity regime (~50 % relative humidity), both sexes showed desiccation acclimation which persisted for 2–3 days. However, only females responded to acclimation at ~5 % relative humidity (RH). Acclimated flies exhibited no changes in the rate of water loss, which is consistent with a lack of plastic changes in cuticular traits (body melanization, epicuticular lipid). Therefore, changes in cuticular permeability are unlikely in drought-acclimated adult flies of D. melanogaster. In acclimated flies, we found sex differences in changes in the content of osmolytes (trehalose in females versus glycogen in males). These sex-specific changes in osmolytes are rapid and reversible and match to corresponding changes in the increased desiccation resistance levels of acclimated flies. Further, the increased content of trehalose in females and glycogen in males support the bound-water hypothesis for water retention in acclimated flies. Thus, drought acclimation in adult flies of D. melanogaster involves inducible changes in osmolytes (trehalose and glycogen), while there is little support for changes in cuticular permeability.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A thin septum in the midline of a connecting trachea coupling both ears is regarded to be important in producing frequency-dependent interaural intensity differences (IIDs) for sound localization. However, the fundamental role of the septum in directional hearing has recently been challenged by the finding that the localization ability is ensured even with a perforated septum, at least under controlled laboratory conditions. Here, we investigated the influence of the medial septum on phonotaxis of female Gryllus bimaculatus under natural conditions. Surprisingly, even with a perforated septum, females reliably tracked a male calling song in the field. Although reduced by 5.2 dB, IIDs still averaged at 7.9 dB and provided a reliable proximate basis for the observed behavioural performance of operated females in the field.

Conceivably, these changes enable the ear to adapt toward sensing various physically well-characterized stimuli. This review develops a scenario that integrates sensory cell with organ evolution. We propose that molecular and cellular evolution of the vertebrate hair cells occurred prior to the formation of the vertebrate ear. We previously proposed that the genes driving hair cell differentiation were aggregated in the otic region through developmental re-patterning that generated a unique vertebrate embryonic structure, the otic placode. In agreement with the presence of graviceptive receptors in many vertebrate outgroups, it is likely that the vertebrate ear originally functioned as a simple gravity-sensing organ. Based on the rare occurrence of angular acceleration receptors in vertebrate outgroups, we further propose that the canal system evolved with a more sophisticated ear morphogenesis. This evolving morphogenesis obviously turned the initial otocyst into a complex set of canals and recesses, harboring multiple sensory epithelia each adapted to the acquisition of a specific aspect of a given physical stimulus. As support for this evolutionary progression, we provide several details of the molecular basis of ear development.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The rules governing the interactions, in particular, who is listening to whom are largely unknown, presumably influenced by distance between callers, caller density, and intensities of interfering calls. We report vocal interactions in a unison bout caller, the green tree frog (Hyla cinerea). Using a microphone array, we monitored bouts from a local group of six callers embedded in a larger chorus. Data were analyzed in a 21-min segment at the peak of the chorus. Callers within this group were localized and their voices were separated for analysis of spatio-temporal interactions. We show that callers in this group: (1) synchronize with one another, (2) prefer to time their calls antiphonally, almost exactly at one-third and two-thirds of the call intervals of their neighbors, (3) tolerate call collision when antiphonal calling is not possible, and (4) perform discrete phase-hopping between three preferred phases when tracking other callers.

We measured feeding and digestive parameters at three concentrations of detritus (0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mm3 l−1), so that functional relationships between ingestive and digestive processes could be assessed. Increasing concentrations of detritus (food) resulted in a reduction in filtering activity (clearance rate l h−1), but an increase in ingestion rate. Consequently, gut content also increased with increasing food concentration, irrespective of food type. In contrast, the trend followed by absorption efficiency with increasing ingestion rate was determined by food type, being significantly reduced (from 0.63 to 0.11) with Juncus but remaining almost constant with the green macroalgae (0.58 ± 0.07 with Ulva) or only minimally reduced (from 0.66 to 0.48 with Enteromorpha).

We show that chemical stimuli reach the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons but not their somata, and that odorant-induced Ca2+ signals in the somata are sufficiently stable over time to allow stimulation with a substantial number of odorants. Pharmacological manipulations served to elucidate the source of odorant-induced Ca2+ transients and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in the somata of olfactory receptor neurons. Both Ca2+ signals are primarily mediated by an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels that can be blocked by CoCl2 and the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. Intracellular Ca2+ stores contribute little to odorant-induced Ca2+ transients and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. The odorant-induced Ca2+ transients as well as the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations depend on action potentials mediated by Na+ channels that are largely TTX-insensitive but blocked by the local anesthetics tetracaine and lidocaine. Collectively, these results corroborate the conclusion that odorant-induced Ca2+ transients and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in the somata of olfactory receptor neurons closely reflect action potential activity associated with odorant-induced phasic-tonic responses and spontaneous bursting, respectively.

Specimens from Svalbard, Greenland (Nuuk), Iceland (Hólar and Mossfellsbær) and continental Europe [Norway (Bergen), Sweden (Kullen) and Germany] were reared in the laboratory in a common-garden experiment. The aim was to test for variations in minimum lethal temperature, freeze duration tolerance, carbohydrate reserves and metabolic rate among the populations. Cold tolerance was related to environmental temperature of the respective location. Populations from the coldest climatic regions were able to tolerate freezing down to at least −15 °C and endured being frozen at −5 °C for 27–48 days, respectively. Populations from milder climates had a lower freeze duration tolerance (about −9 °C) and endured −5 °C for a shorter period (between 9 and 16 days). Glucose accumulation and glycogen reserves varied significantly between populations, but was not related directly to cold tolerance. Metabolic rate varied significantly between populations, but was not significantly related to cold tolerance. The metabolic rates at −2 °C of frozen and unfrozen worms from Germany and Svalbard were tested. The metabolic depression due to freezing of these populations was relatively small (<50 %), suggesting that the large carbohydrate accumulations may also be important as fuel during long-term freezing at moderately low temperatures.

However, whether they are involved in performing the T-maze task is still unknown. In this study, the delayed nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task in a T-maze was given to rats. The percentage of correct choices denoting the performance accuracy was calculated and the protein levels of PKMζ and KIBRA in rat’s prefrontal cortex were measured. The results showed significantly increased performance accuracy after the training phase, which was maintained on the next day in groups with a delay of 10 s but not 30 s, indicating that 30 s is too long for rats to maintain working memory. As for the expressions of PKMζ and KIBRA, significant increases were observed 1 day after the training phase, indicating that the formation of reference memory accompanies an increase in PKMζ and KIBRA. No significant difference was found among groups with various delay intervals, indicating that the expressions of PKMζ and KIBRA exert no effects on the performance of working memory. These results provide the first evidence that KIBRA as well as PKMζ is closely related to reference memory but not working memory in rats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Pairwise comparison of α-amylase nucleotide sequences revealed 96–98 % identity, and comparison of amino acid portions revealed 93–95 % similarity among the four prickleback species. Expression was determined using in situ hybridization and intensity of expression quantified using image analysis. Alpha-amylase expression level was compared in three feeding categories of the four species: (1) small, wild-caught carnivorous juveniles; (2) larger, wild-caught juveniles of the carnivorous species and the three that had shifted to herbivory or omnivory; and (3) larger, juveniles produced by feeding a low-starch artificial diet to small juveniles until they reached the size of the larger wild-caught juveniles. The results showed no dietary effect in any species but significant ontogenetic and species-level effects in Cebidichthys violaceus, as well as in the sister species Xiphister mucosus and X. atropurpureus. Based on a phylogeny for the Stichaeidae produced for this study using two mtDNA genes and one nuclear gene, the ontogenetic dietary shifts to herbivory/omnivory evolved independently in C. violaceus and in the clade containing the two species of Xiphister. All three of these species increased α-amylase gene expression with increase in size and had higher expression than Anoplarchuspurpurescens, which is a member of a third, stichaeid clade comprising carnivores.

Dances are composed of repeated waggle runs, which encode the distance and direction vector from the hive or swarm to the resource. Distance is encoded in the duration of the waggle run, and direction is encoded in the angle of the dancer’s body relative to vertical. Glass-walled observation hives enable researchers to observe or video, and decode waggle runs. However, variation in these signals makes it impossible to determine exact locations advertised. We present a Bayesian duration to distance calibration curve using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to quantify how accurately distance to a food resource can be predicted from waggle run durations within a single dance. An angular calibration shows that angular precision does not change over distance, resulting in spatial scatter proportional to distance. We demonstrate how to combine distance and direction to produce a spatial probability distribution of the resource location advertised by the dance. Finally, we show how to map honey bee foraging and discuss how our approach can be integrated with Geographic Information Systems to better understand honey bee foraging ecology.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Lower animals can synthesize all four classes of fatty acids from non-lipid sources, but both omega-6 and omega-3 cannot be synthesized de novo by ‘higher’ animals and are therefore essential components of their diet. The relationship between normal variation in diet fatty acid composition and membrane fatty acid composition is little investigated. Studies in the rat show that, with respect to the general classes of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) membrane fatty acid composition is homeostatically regulated despite diet variation. This is not the case for fatty acid composition of storage lipids, which responds to diet variation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are important determinants of physical and chemical properties of membranes. They are the substrates for lipid peroxidation and it is possible to calculate a peroxidation index (PI) for a particular membrane composition. Membrane PI appears to be homeostatically regulated with respect to diet PI.

We hypothesised that due to rumino-hepatic nitrogen (N) recycling adaptation of N homeostasis and adjustment of electrolyte handling to LCP intake differs between goats and monogastric animals. Therefore, an experiment similar to that with goats was conducted with rats. Two feeding groups received a diet either containing 20 or 8 % crude protein (as fed basis) for 5 weeks and intake and excretion of N, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) were determined. To detect systemic and endocrine adaptation to LCP intake plasma concentrations of urea, Ca, phosphate (Pi), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were measured. Adjustment of renal electrolyte transport was assessed by detecting protein expression of key proteins of renal Pi transport. All data were compared with the data of the goat experiment. LCP intake decreased plasma urea concentration stronger in goats than in rats. In both species urinary N excretion declined, but faecal N excretion decreased in goats only. Furthermore, in goats urinary Ca excretion decreased, but in rats urinary Ca concentration increased. Decreased plasma IGF-1 and calcitriol concentrations were found in goats only. Thus, renal Ca excretion appears to be a common target in adaptation of electrolyte homeostasis in both species, but is regulated differently.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study examined the mobilization of fatty acids from blubber and their subsequent partitioning into maternal metabolism and milk production in northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). The fatty acid composition of blubber and milk was measured in both early and late lactation. Proportions of fatty acids in milk and blubber were found to display a high degree of similarity both early and late in lactation. Seals mobilized an enormous amount of lipid (~66 kg in 17 days), but thermoregulatory fatty acids, those that remain fluid at low temperatures, were relatively conserved in the outer blubber layer. Despite the stratification, the pattern of mobilization of specific fatty acids conforms to biochemical predictions. Long chain (>20C) monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were the least mobilized from blubber and the only class of fatty acids that showed a proportional increase in milk in late lactation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were more mobilized from the blubber, but neither proportion increased in milk at late lactation. These data suggest that of the long chain MUFA mobilized, the majority is directed to milk synthesis. The mother may preferentially use PUFA and SFA for her own metabolism, decreasing the availability for deposition into milk. The potential impacts of milk fatty acid delivery on pup diving development and thermoregulation are exciting avenues for exploration.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A dive response during aerobic dives enables the efficient use of blood and muscle oxygen stores, but it is exercise modulated to maximize the aerobic dive limit at different levels of exertion. Blood volume and concentrations of blood hemoglobin and muscle myoglobin are elevated and serve as a significant oxygen store that increases aerobic dive duration. However, myoglobin is not homogeneously distributed in the locomotory muscles and is highest in areas that produce greater force and consume more oxygen during aerobic swimming. Muscle fibers are primarily fast and slow twitch oxidative with elevated mitochondrial volume densities and enhanced oxidative enzyme activities that are highest in areas that produce more force generation. Most of the muscle mitochondria are interfibriller and homogeneously distributed. This reduces the diffusion distance between mitochondria and helps maintain aerobic metabolism under hypoxic conditions. Mitochondrial volume densities and oxidative enzyme activities are also elevated in certain organs such as liver, kidneys, and stomach. Hepatic and renal function along with digestion and assimilation continue during aerobic dives to maintain physiological homeostasis. Most ATP production comes from aerobic fat metabolism in carnivorous marine mammals. Glucose is derived mostly from gluconeogenesis and is conserved for tissues such as red blood cells and the central nervous system. Marine mammals minimize the energetic cost of swimming and diving through body streamlining, efficient, lift-based propulsive appendages, and cost-efficient modes of locomotion that reduce drag and take advantage of changes in buoyancy with depth. Most dives are within the animal’s aerobic dive limit, which maximizes time underwater and minimizes recovery time at the surface. The result of these adaptations is increased breath-hold duration and enhanced foraging ability that maximizes energy intake and minimizes energy output while making aerobic dives to depth. These adaptations are the long, evolutionary legacy of an aquatic lifestyle that directly affects the fitness of marine mammal species for different diving abilities and environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A series of in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to understand the role of cutaneous ammonia excretion (Jamm) under control conditions and after 12-h pre-exposure to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 2 mmol/l NH4HCO3). Divided chamber experiments with bladder-catheterized, rectally ligated fish under light anesthesia were performed to separate cutaneous Jamm from branchial, renal, and intestinal Jamm. Under control conditions, cutaneous Jamm accounted for 4.5 % of total Jamm in vivo. In fish pre-exposed to HEA, plasma total ammonia concentration increased 20-fold to approximately 1,000 μmol/l, branchial Jamm increased 1.5- to 2.7-fold, and urinary Jamm increased about 7-fold. Urinary Jamm still accounted for less than 2 % of total Jamm. Cutaneous Jamm increased 4-fold yet amounted to only 5.7 % of total Jamm in these fish. Genes (Rhcg1, Rhcg2, Rhbg, NHE-2, v-type H+-ATPase) known to be involved in ammonia excretion at the gills of trout were all expressed at the mRNA level in the skin, but their expression did not increase with HEA pre-exposure. In vitro analyses using [14C] methylamine (MA), an ammonia analog which is transported by Rh proteins, demonstrated that MA permeability in isolated skin sections was higher in HEA pre-exposed fish than in control fish. The addition of basolateral ammonia (1,000 μmol/l) to this system abolished this increase in permeability, suggesting ammonia competition with MA for Rh-mediated transport across the skin of HEA pre-exposed trout; this did not occur in skin sections from control trout. Moreover, in vitro Jamm by the skin of fish which had been pre-exposed to HEA was also higher than in control fish in the absence of basolateral ammonia, pointing towards a possible cutaneous ammonia loading in response to HEA. In vitro MA permeability was reduced upon the addition of amiloride (10−4 mol/l), but not phenamil (10−5 mol/l) suggesting a role for a Na/H-exchanger (NHE) in cutaneous ammonia transport, as has been previously described in the skin of larval fish. Overall, it appears that under control conditions and in response to HEA pre-exposure, the skin makes only a very minor contribution to total Jamm, but the observed increases in cutaneous Jamm in vivo and in cutaneous Jamm and MA permeability in vitro demonstrate the capacity for ammonia transport in the skin of adult trout. It remains unclear if this capacity may become significant under certain environmental challenges or if it is merely a remnant of cutaneous transport capacity from early life stages in these fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the presence of visual landmarks, six sharks were trained in a fixed turn response. Group 1 started from two possible compartments approaching two goal locations, while group 2 started from and approached only one location, respectively. The learning criterion was reached within 9 ± 5.29 (group 1) and 8.3 ± 3.51 sessions (group 2). Transfer tests revealed that sharks had applied a direction strategy, possibly in combination with some form of place learning. Without visual cues, sharks relied solely on the former. To identify the underlying neural substrate(s), telencephalic were lesioned and performance compared before and after surgery. Ablation of the dorsal and medial pallia only had an effect on one shark (group 1), indicating that the acquisition and retention of previously gained knowledge were unaffected in the remaining four individuals. Nonetheless, the shark re-learned the task. In summary, C. griseum can utilize fixed turn responses to navigate to a goal; there is also some evidence for the use of external visual landmarks while orienting. Probably, strategies can be used alone or in combination. Neither the dorsal nor medial pallium seems to be responsible for the acquisition and processing of egocentric information.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hildebrand,"2010; Hansson and Stensmyr 2011; Martin et al. 2011). Especially, research on sex-pheromone systems in Lepidoptera has significantly contributed to the understanding of the functional organization and physiology of the insect olfactory system (Hildebrand 1996). The pioneering studies on moths were followed by research on other insect chemosensory model systems, which boosted the whole field of chemosensory sciences. Social Hymenoptera like the honeybee and ants have opened up the field for the study of mechanisms of chemosensory behavior in the context of social communication, learning and memory (e.g. Hölldobler 1999; Menzel and Giurfa 2001; Galizia and Rössler 2010). The astounding genetic tool-box of Drosophila melanogaster allowed for the rise of neurogenetics that dissected chemosensory behavior all the way down to the level of behaviorally relevant genes (e.g. Konopka and Benzer 1971; Fernández and Kravitz 2013, in this issue). Due to the enormous breadth of experimental approaches that can be applied, chemosensory research on insects today represents a most lively, original, stimulating, and innovative field in the behavioral neurosciences with a close link to chemical and behavioral ecology. On one hand, it demonstrates common principles of chemosensory systems even shared between insects and mammals (e.g. Hildebrand and Shepherd 1997), and on the other hand, it illustrates the amazingly inventive variations to common schemes across different species adapted to various environments (Galizia and Rössler 2010; Hansson and Stensmyr 2011). This special issue is based upon the topics of an international symposium at the University of Würzburg, Germany, in July 2012, in honor of John Hildebrand. The symposium was initiated by Ed Kravitz and Monika Stengl and was organized by Wolfgang Rössler (University Würzburg, Germany) and Monika Stengl (University of Kassel, Germany). The meeting was supported by the DFG priority This special issue is dedicated to John G. Hildebrand, Regents Professor, founding director and many years (1985–2013) head of the Arizona Research Laboratories Division of Neurobiology (since 2009 the Department of Neuroscience), University of Arizona in Tucson, to pay tribute to his outstanding contributions over his long career devoted to understanding the neuroethology of insect chemoreception. Chemosensory systems play key roles for the survival and reproduction of most animal species. It has puzzled scientists since many years how the highly complex molecular olfactory world is detected by olfactory receptors, encoded into neuronal activity, and processed within the central nervous system to finally trigger adaptive behavior. Even today, olfactory transduction as well as encoding and perception are far from being understood and are lively debated in the various areas of chemosensory research. Since the beginning, insects have played a very influential role in this field, due to the important role of olfaction for insect behavior and the accessibility of insects for different experimental manipulations.

Here we investigated the impact of predicted environmental warming (+3 °C) on the development, metabolism, heat shock response and antioxidant defense mechanisms of the early stages of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris. As expected, warming shortened embryonic developmental time by 13 days, from 38 days at 18 °C to 25 days at 21 °C. Concomitantly, survival decreased significantly (~29.9 %). Size at hatching varied inversely with temperature, and the percentage of smaller premature paralarvae increased drastically, from 0 % at 18 °C to 17.8 % at 21 °C. The metabolic costs of the transition from an encapsulated embryo to a free planktonic form increased significantly with warming, and HSP70 concentrations and glutathione S-transferase activity levels were significantly magnified from late embryonic to paralarval stages. Yet, despite the presence of effective antioxidant defense mechanisms, ocean warming led to an augmentation of malondialdehyde levels (an indicative of enhanced ROS action), a process considered to be one of the most frequent cellular injury mechanisms. Thus, the present study provides clues about how the magnitude and rate of ocean warming will challenge the buffering capacities of octopus embryos and hatchlings’ physiology.

Their characteristic “zigzagging” trajectory has long been thought to result from the interaction of two mechanisms, an odor-modulated orientation to wind and a built-in central nervous system turning program. An interesting and as of yet unanswered question about this tracking behavior is how the cross-section of an odor plume or its clean-air “edges” affects moths’ odor tracking behavior. This study attempts to address this question by video recording and analyzing the behavior of freely flying M. sexta males tracking plumes from pheromone sources of different lengths and orientations with equal odor concentration per unit area. Our results showed that moths generated significantly wider tracks in wide plumes from the longest horizontally-oriented sources as compared to narrower point-source plumes, but had relatively unaltered tracks when orienting to plumes from the same length sources oriented vertically. This suggests that in addition to wind and the presence of pheromones, the area of the plume’s cross section or its edges may also play an important role in the plume tracking mechanisms of M. sexta.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Recent studies have focused on the importance of maintaining sensory stimulation to the limbs of SCI patients as a way to initiate and control the CPG locomotor network. We began assessing the role of sensory feedback to the locomotor CPG network using a neonatal mouse spinal cord preparation where the hindlimbs are still attached. Removing sensory feedback coming from the hindlimbs by way of a lower lumbar transection or by ventral root denervation revealed a positive correlation in the ability of sensory input deprivation to disrupt ongoing locomotor activity on older versus younger animals. The differences in the motor responses as a function of age could be correlated with the loss of excitatory activity from sensory afferents.

Courtship and aggression are the most important social behaviors in nature for procreation and survival: for males, making the right choice between the two depends on the ability to identify the sex of the other individual. In flies as in most species, males court females and attack other males. Although many sensory modalities are involved in sex recognition, chemosensory communication mediated by specific molecules that serve as pheromones plays a key role in helping males distinguish between courtship and aggression targets. The chemosensory signals used by flies include volatile and non-volatile compounds, detected by the olfactory and gustatory systems.

Dimensions of functional importance are defined and measured, and normalized in relation to animal mass.

More generally, our method allows morphologists to identify sensory organ combinations that are characteristic of particular ecological niches. After normalization for animal size, we note that arboreal mammals tend to have larger eyes and smaller noses than terrestrial mammals.

In vivo, total ammonia concentrations (Tamm) in the chyme were approximately 1 mmol L−1 across the entire intestine at 24 h after the meal. Highest chyme pH and PNH3 values occurred in the posterior intestine. In vitro gut sac experiments examined ammonia handling with mucosal (Jmamm) and serosal (Jsamm) fluxes under conditions of fasting and feeding, with either background (control ≤0.013 mmol L−1) or high luminal ammonia concentrations (HLA = 1 mmol L−1), the latter mimicking those seen in chyme in vivo. Feeding status (fasted or fed) appeared to influence ammonia handling by each individual section. The anterior intestine exhibited the greatest Jmamm and Jsamm values under fasted control conditions, but these differences tended to disappear under typical post-feeding conditions when total endogenous ammonia production (Jtamm = Jsamm − Jmamm, signs considered) was greatly elevated in all intestinal sections. Under fasted conditions, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutaminase (GLN) activities were equal across all sections, but the ammonia-trapping enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) exhibited highest activity in the posterior intestine, in contradiction to previous literature. Feeding clearly stimulated the total rate of endogenous ammonia production (Jtamm), even in the absence of a high luminal ammonia load. This was accompanied by an increase in GDH activity of the anterior intestine, which was also the site of the largest Jtamm. In all sections, during HLA exposure, either alone or in combination with feeding, there were much larger increases in endogenous Jtamm, most of which was effluxed to the serosal solution. This is interpreted as a response to avoid potential cytotoxicity due to overburdened detoxification mechanisms in the face of elevated mucosal ammonia. Thus Tamm of the intestinal tissue remained relatively constant regardless of feeding status and exposure to HLA. Ammonia production by the gut may explain up to 18 % of whole-body ammonia excretion in vivo under fasting conditions, and 47 % after feeding, of which more than half originates from endogenous production rather than from absorption from the lumen.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The aim of the current study was to specifically target potential critical windows in renal development, and assess altered renal function through disruptions in embryonic fluid compartments. In addition, the effect of exogenous tRA administration on embryonic growth and metabolism was determined. Embryos were exposed to 0.1 or 0.3 mg tRA on embryonic day 8. Morphological and physiological measurements were made on days 12, 14, 16 and 18. Embryo wet mass on day 18 was reduced by 23 % (0.1 mg tRA) and 44 % (0.3 mg tRA). tRA exposure elevated mass-specific oxygen consumption in embryos exposed to 0.1 mg (21.2 ± 0.3 μL−1 g−1 min−1) and 0.3 mg (23.4 ± 0.4 μL−1 g−1 min−1) when compared to sham (18.9 ± 0.6 μL−1 g−1 min−1) on day 14, but not subsequent incubation days.

A temperature decrease in the heat-sensing membrane of the pit organ has the potential to enhance heat flux between their endothermic prey and the thermal sensors, affect the optimal functioning of thermal sensors in the pit membrane and reduce the formation of thermal “afterimages”, improving thermal detection. We examined the potential for respiratory cooling to improve strike behaviour, capture, and consumption of endothermic prey in the South American rattlesnake, as behavioural indicators of thermal detection. Snakes with a higher degree of rostral cooling were more accurate during the strike, attacking warmer regions of their prey, and relocated and consumed their prey faster. These findings reveal that by cooling their pit organs, rattlesnakes increase their ability to detect endothermic prey; disabling the pit organs caused these differences to disappear. Rattlesnakes also modify the degree of rostral cooling by altering their breathing pattern in response to biologically relevant stimuli, such as a mouse odour. Our findings reveal that low humidity increases their ability to detect endothermic prey, suggesting that habitat and ambush site selection in the wild may be influenced by external humidity levels as well as temperature.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we investigated how these proportions are encoded in the primary olfactory processing center, the antennal lobe, of male Manduca sexta moths. Two key components of the female’s sex pheromone, present in an approximately 2:1 ratio, are processed in each of two neighboring glomeruli in the macroglomerular complex (MGC) of males of this species. In wind-tunnel flight experiments, males exhibited behavioral selectivity for ratios approximating the ratio released by conspecific females. The ratio between components was poorly represented, however, in the firing-rate output of uniglomerular MGC projection neurons (PNs). PN firing rate was mostly insensitive to the ratio between components, and individual PNs did not exhibit a preference for a particular ratio. Recording simultaneously from pairs of PNs in the same glomerulus, we found that the natural ratio between components elicited the most synchronous spikes, and altering the proportion of either component decreased the proportion of synchronous spikes. The degree of synchronous firing between PNs in the same glomerulus thus selectively encodes the natural ratio that most effectively evokes the natural behavioral response to pheromone.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Lipid and protein oxidation level, oxidant (H2O2) generation, antioxidative status (levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and reductase, ascorbic acid and non-protein sulfhydryl) and activities of respiratory complexes (I, II, III and IV) in mitochondria were investigated in muscle of H. fossilis under air exposure condition (0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 h at 25 °C). The increased levels of both H2O2 and tissue oxidation were observed due to the decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes in muscle under water deprivation condition. However, ascorbic acid and non-protein thiol groups were the highest at 18 h air exposure time. A linear increase in complex II activity with air exposure time and an increase up to 12 h followed by a decrease in activity of complex I at 18 h were observed. Negative correlation was observed for complex III and V activity with exposure time. Critical time to modulate the above parameters was found to be 3 h air exposure. Dehydration induced oxidative stress due to modulation of electron transport chain and redox metabolizing enzymes in muscle of H. fossilis was clearly observed.

Across space, we examine altitudinal and latitudinal patterns, incorporating inter-specific analyses at regional and global scales. This synthesis highlights the consistency or lack thereof, of thermal trait responses, the relative magnitude of change among traits and several knowledge gaps identified in the relationships examined.

This study compares stress and condition measures of co-occurring declining and non-declining tropical grass finch species in Australia. We monitored declining Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) and non-declining long-tailed and masked finches (Poepila acuticauda and P. personata) during two seasons that are potentially stressful: peak breeding (early dry season when food is plentiful) and moult (late dry to early wet season when food may be scarce). We measured body condition (muscle and fat), haematocrit, and stress response to capture using plasma corticosterone and binding globulin concentrations. All species had higher muscle and lower fat indices during breeding than moult. Haematocrit did not consistently differ between seasons. Long-tailed finches had higher stress responses during breeding than moult, similar to other passerines studied. Masked finches showed no seasonal changes in stress response. Gouldian finches had stress response patterns opposite to those of long-tailed finches, with higher stress responses during moult. However, seasonal trends in Gouldian and long-tailed finch stress responses sometimes differed between years or sites. The differences in stress response patterns between species suggest that the declining Gouldian finch is more sensitive to recent environmental changes which are thought to further reduce grass seed food resources during the late dry to early wet season. Retention of stress responsiveness during a protracted moult could increase the survival potential of Gouldian finches.

As knowledge about the energy conserving strategies in desert bats is scant, we used temperature-telemetry to quantify the thermal physiology of tree-roosting inland freetail bats (Mormopterus species 3, 8.5 g, n = 8) at Sturt National Park over two summers (2010–2012), when Ta was high and insects were relatively abundant. Torpor use and activity were affected by Ta. Bats remained normothermic on the warmest days; they employed one “morning” torpor bout on most days and typically exhibited two torpor bouts on the coolest days. Overall, animals employed torpor on 67.9 % of bat-days and torpor bout duration ranged from 0.5 to 39.3 h. At any given Ta, torpor bouts were longer in Mormopterus than in bats from temperate and subtropical habitats. Furthermore, unlike bats from other climatic regions that used only partial passive rewarming, Mormopterus aroused from torpor using either almost entirely passive (68.9 % of all arousals) or active rewarming (31.1 %). We provide the first quantitative data on torpor in a free-ranging arid-zone molossid during summer.

In voltage sensitive sodium channel (Nav) channels from jellyfish to human the fourth amino acid is Ala. This Ala, when mutated to Asp, promotes slow inactivation. In some Nav channels of pufferfishes, the Ala is replaced with Gly. We studied the biophysical properties of an Ala-to-Gly substitution (A1529G) in rat Nav1.4 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes alone or with a β1 subunit. The Ala-to-Gly substitution does not affect monovalent cation selectivity and positively shifts the voltage-dependent inactivation curve, although co-expression with a β1 subunit eliminates the difference between A1529G and WT. There is almost no difference in channel fast inactivation, but the β1 subunit accelerates WT current inactivation significantly more than it does the A1529G channels. The Ala-to-Gly substitution mainly influences the rate of recovery from slow inactivation. Again, the β1 subunit is less effective on speeding recovery of A1529G than the WT. We searched Nav channels in numerous databases and noted at least four other independent Ala-to-Gly substitutions in Nav channels in teleost fishes. Thus, the Ala-to-Gly substitution occurs more frequently than previously realized, possibly under selection for alterations of channel gating.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These redirections were largely restricted to rather small deviations from the trained route (<60°, <200 m) and occurred only if the animal did not receive the trained odorant stimulus at the trained feeding site.

Deviation from this ratio results in reduced attraction. Projection neurons innervating prominent male-specific glomeruli in the male’s antennal lobe produce maximal synchronized spiking activity in response to synthetic mixtures of the two components centering around the natural ratio, suggesting that behaviorally effective mixture ratios are encoded by synchronous neuronal activity. We investigated the physiological activity and morphology of downstream protocerebral neurons that responded to antennal stimulation with single pheromone components and their mixtures at various concentration ratios. Among the tested neurons, only a few gave stronger responses to the mixture at the natural ratio whereas most did not distinguish among the mixtures that were tested. We also found that the population response distinguished among the two pheromone components and their mixtures, prior to the peak population response. This observation is consistent with our previous finding that synchronous firing of antennal-lobe projection neurons reaches its maximum before the firing rate reaches its peak.

A well-developed longitudinal muscle layer exists in the posterior mesenteric artery of adult female chickens but not adult male chickens. The muscle layer is poorly developed in chickens aged < 15 weeks, even in female chickens. Mechanical responses of muscles were recorded and perivascular nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). EFS induced monophasic contractions in longitudinal muscle of the posterior mesenteric artery segment, and those responses were inhibited by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin. Blockers for cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors did not affect EFS-evoked contractions but an antagonist for P2X purinoceptors blocked them. The present study demonstrated that the longitudinal muscle in the posterior mesenteric artery of the domestic fowl develops between the 5th and 15th week of life, suggesting that its development is involved in oviposition.

The timing of these physiological transitions has been estimated using measures of substrate oxidation including changes in respiratory exchange ratios, blood metabolites, nitrogen excretion, or enzyme activities in tissues. Here, we demonstrate how 13CO2-breath testing can be used to partition among the oxidation of distinct nutrient pools in the body (i.e., carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) that have become artificially enriched in 13C. Seventy-two Swiss Webster mice were raised to adulthood on diets supplemented with 13C-1-l-leucine, 13C-1-palmitic acid, 13C-1-d-glucose, or no tracer.

Measurements of endogenous nutrient oxidation by way of 13CO2-breath testing revealed a decrease in the rate of oxidation of carbohydrates from 61 to 10 % of the total energy expenditure during the first 6 h without food. This response was mirrored by a coincidental increase in rate of endogenous lipid oxidation from 18 to 64 %. A transient peak in carbohydrate oxidation occurred between 8 and 14 h, presumably during increased glycogen mobilization. A well-defined period of protein sparing between 8 and 12 h was observed where endogenous protein oxidation accounted for as little as 8 % of the total energy expenditure. Thereafter, protein oxidation continually increased accounting for as much as 24 % of the total energy expenditure by 72 h.

During these fasts, energetic requirements are met primarily through the catabolism of blubber lipid. To assess whether fatty acid (FA) composition changes during the postweaning fast in northern elephant seals, blubber biopsies were acquired longitudinally from 43 pups at 2.3 ± 1.5 and 55.2 ± 3.7 days postweaning in 1999 and 2000. At weaning, short-chain monounsaturated FA (SC-MUFA, ≤18 carbons) dominated the blubber while saturated FA (SFA) were found in the next highest proportion. The major FA (all ≥1 % by mass) comprised approximately 91 % of total blubber FA. In both years, 18:1n-9 and 16:0 were the most prevalent FA. Major FA mobilized during the fast consisted of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), SFA, and SC-MUFA. Long-chain MUFA (>18 carbons) tended to be conserved. The fractional mobilization value of 20:5n-3 was the highest, resulting in significant reductions of this PUFA. Although concentrations of some blubber FA changed significantly during the postweaning fast, the general FA signature of blubber was similar at weaning and near the end of the fast. Changes in some FA differed across years. For example, the concentration of 20:4n-6, a minor PUFA, was significantly reduced in 1999 but not in 2000. FA mobilization patterns in northern elephant seal pups are somewhat similar to those reported previously for other fasting phocids and terrestrial mammals, though there are some notable differences. Differences in FA mobilization patterns across mammalian species may be related to differences in diets, geographical distribution, environmental factors, physiological adaptations, and life history stage.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, some data suggested that bees may be able to use alternative channels for shape processing, and recent work shows conditioning type and training length can significantly influence bee learning and cue use. We thus tested the honeybees’ ability to discriminate between two closed shapes considering either absolute or differential conditioning, and using eight stimuli differing in their spectral characteristics. Consistent with previous work, green contrast enabled reliable shape learning for both types of conditioning, but surprisingly, we found that bees trained with appetitive-aversive differential conditioning could additionally use colour and/or UV contrast to enable shape discrimination. Interestingly, we found that a high blue contrast initially interferes with bee shape learning, probably due to the bees innate preference for blue colours, but with increasing experience bees can learn a variety of spectral and/or colour cues to facilitate spatial learning. Thus, the relationship between bee pollinators and the spatial and spectral cues that they use to find rewarding flowers appears to be a more rich visual environment than previously thought.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, shifts in sex ratio have been demonstrated across bird species and it was suggested that females are able to adjust the primary sex ratio. One possible mechanism is the glucocorticoid corticosterone which rises under stressful conditions and can be deposited into egg yolk by mothers. We analysed primary sex ratio of common terns Sterna hirundo from 2006 to 2008 and related it to maternal baseline corticosterone level, laying date and year. Therefore, we took 101 blood samples of 71 breeding females via blood sucking bugs, a method with negligible stress for the birds. Sex ratio did not differ from parity in any of the analysed years, which were characterized by poor food availability and breeding success. Only within 1 year there was a tendency for more females in the last hatched chick. Neither corticosterone level nor laying date or year showed an influence on hatching sex ratio. The negative result concerning primary sex ratio and maternal baseline corticosterone level might suggest conditions to be good enough for mothers to prevent them from depositing high levels of corticosterone into eggs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In both sensilla types the activity level was reduced during winter, which correlated to changes in acclimatization temperature (r = 0.7), the reduction was greater at high recording temperatures, and the effects of exposure to cold were reversed by transferring the animals indoors. However, T1 activity always increased monotonically, if the recording temperature was increased from 5 to 35 °C, whereas T2 activity in cold-acclimatized animals increased to temperatures between 20 and 30 °C and then started decreasing. As a result, the temperature sensitivity of the activity was reduced more profoundly in T2 sensilla (in T2Q10 was reduced from 3.5 in October to 1.4 in January, whereas in T1 it was reduced from 2.5 to 2.2). In conclusion, we have shown that prolonged exposure to cold does affect filiform sensilla; however, the effect is significantly different in the two sensilla types.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In the olfactory system of the moth Manduca sexta, the response properties of different types of antennal olfactory receptor cells are known. Likewise, a subset of antennal lobe glomeruli has been functionally characterized and the olfactory tuning of their innervating neurons identified. This provides a unique opportunity to determine functional interactions between glomeruli of known input, specifically, (1) glomeruli processing plant odors and (2) glomeruli activated by antennal stimulation with pheromone components of conspecific females. Several studies describe reciprocal inhibitory effects between different types of pheromone-responsive projection neurons suggesting lateral inhibitory interactions between pheromone component-selective glomerular neural circuits. Furthermore, antennal lobe projection neurons that respond to host plant volatiles and innervate single, ordinary glomeruli are inhibited during antennal stimulation with the female’s sex pheromone.

Rhopalial pacemakers control locomotion through a complex neural signal transmitted to the ring nerve and the signal frequency is modulated by the visual input. Since electrical synapses have never been found in the cubozoan nervous system all signals are thought to be transmitted across chemical synapses, and so far information about the neurotransmitters involved are based on immunocytochemical or behavioural data. Here we present the first direct physiological evidence for the types of neurotransmitters involved in sensory information processing in the rhopalial nervous system. FMRFamide, serotonin and dopamine are shown to have inhibitory effect on the pacemaker frequency. There are some indications that the fast acting acetylcholine and glycine have an initial effect and then rapidly desensitise.

We previously have shown that this seasonal change in physiology is associated with higher levels of mRNA for the potent inhibitor of leptin signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of LD hamsters relative to hamsters in SD. The alteration in SOCS3 gene expression preceded the body weight change suggesting that SOCS3 might be the molecular switch of seasonal body weight changes. To functionally characterize the role of SOCS3 in seasonal body weight regulation, we injected SOCS3 expressing recombinant adeno-associated virus type-2 (rAAV2-SOCS3) constructs into the ARC of leptin sensitive SD hamsters immediately after weaning. Hamsters that received rAAV2 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rAAV2-EGFP) served as controls. ARC-directed SOCS3 overexpression led to a significant increase in body weight over a period of 12 weeks without fully restoring the LD phenotype. This increase was partially due to elevated brown and white adipose tissue mass. Gene expression of pro-opiomelanocortin was increased while thyroid hormone converting enzyme DIO3 mRNA levels were reduced in SD hamsters with SOCS3 overexpression. In conclusion, our data suggest that ARC-directed SOCS3 overexpression partially overcomes the profound seasonal body weight cycle exhibited by the hamster which is associated with altered pro-opiomelanocortin and DIO3 gene expression.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To date no report exists regarding the role of the ambient photoperiod in the regulation of melatonin receptor MT1 and clock gene (PER1 and CRY1) expression in the SCN of any tropical rodent that experiences the least variation in the photoperiod. We noted the expression of MT1, PER1 and CRY1 in the SCN of a tropical squirrel, Funambulus pennanti, along with the plasma level of melatonin over 24 h during the reproductively active (summer) and inactive (winter) phases. The seasonal day length affected the peripheral melatonin, which was inversely related with the MT1 expression in the SCN. The timing for peak expression of PER1 was the same in both phases, while the decline in PER1 expression was delayed by 4 h during the inactive phase. The CRY1 peak advanced by 4 h during the active phase, while the interval between the peak and decline of CRY1 remained the same in both phases. It can be suggested that seasonally changing melatonin levels modulate MT1 expression dynamics in the SCN, altering its functional state, and gate SCN molecular “clock” gene profiles through changes in PER/CRY expression.

We examined the effect of distress calls on bats emitting the call as well as the bats receiving the distress signal through analysis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and catacholaminargic systems. We measured the levels of neurotransmitters [serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE)] and stress hormones [(adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT)]. Our results showed that distress call emission elevated the level of ACTH and CORT, as well as 5-HT, DA and NE in the amygdala, for both the call emitting bat and the responding bat. Subsequently, we observed increased activity of glucocorticoid receptor and its steroid receptor co-activator (SRC-1). An expression of SRC-1 was up-regulated in the distress call emitter only, whereas it was at a similar level in both the call responder and silent bats. These findings suggest that bats emitting distress calls and also bats responding to such calls have similar neurotransmitter expression patterns, and may react similarly in response to stress.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Each antennal olfactory receptor neuron expresses one OR with an odorant binding site together with a conserved coreceptor called Orco which does not bind odorants. Orco is necessary for localization of ORs to dendritic membranes and, thus, is essential for odorant detection. It forms a spontaneously opening cation channel, activated via phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Thereafter, Orco is also activated via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Orco forms homo—as well as heteromers with ORs with unknown stoichiometry. Contradictory publications suggest different mechanisms of olfactory transduction. On the one hand, evidence accumulates for the employment of more than one G protein-coupled olfactory transduction cascade in different insects. On the other hand, results from other studies suggest that the OR–Orco complex functions as an odorant-gated cation channel mediating ionotropic signal transduction. This review analyzes conflicting hypotheses concerning the role of Orco in insect olfactory transduction. In conclusion, in situ studies in hawkmoths falsify the hypothesis that Orco underlies odorant-induced ionotropic signal transduction in all insect species. Instead, Orco forms a metabotropically gated, slow cation channel which controls odorant response threshold and kinetics of the sensory neuron.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

For this purpose artificial canals were constructed, some of which were fitted with artificial neuromasts. In still water, the response of a simple canal versus two types of Xiphister-like canals to a vibrating sphere stimulus were similar, as was the decrease in the responses as a function of sphere distance. Also comparable was the mechanical coupling between neighboring parts of the main canal. However, compared to the simple canal, the Xiphister-like canals showed a lower spatial resolution. Equipping artificial lateral line canals with artificial neuromasts revealed that Xiphister-like canals, i.e., lateral lines canals with tubuli that contained widely spaced pores, improve the signal-to-noise ratio in a highly turbulent environment. Even though a reduced spatial resolution is the price for this improvement, Xiphister may compensate for this compromise by having four instead of the usual single trunk lateral line canal. We suggest that lateral line canals with tubuli that contain widely spaced pores and multiple lateral line canals on each body side are an adaptation to a highly turbulent aquatic environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study attempted to clarify if urea flux to the porcine cecum is similarly regulated. Thirty-two weaned piglets were fed diets containing protein (P) of poor prececal digestibility and fibre (F) at high (H) or low levels (L) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After slaughter, cecal content was analyzed and the cecal mucosa incubated in Ussing chambers to measure the effect of pH, SCFA and NH4+ on the flux rates of urea, short-circuit current (Isc) and tissue conductance (Gt). NH4+ significantly enhanced Isc (from 0.5 ± 0.2 to 1.2 ± 0.1 μEq cm−2 h−1). No acute effects of SCFA or ammonia on urea flux were observed. Tissue conductance was significantly lower in the high dietary fibre groups irrespective of the protein content. Only the HP-LF group emerged as different from all others in terms of urea flux (74 ± 6 versus 53 ± 3 nmol cm−2 h−1), associated with higher cecal ammonia concentration and reduced fecal consistency. The data suggest that as in the rumen, uptake of ammonia by the cecum may involve electrogenic transport of the ionic form (NH4+). In contrast to findings in the rumen, neither a high fibre diet nor acute addition of SCFA enhanced urea transport across the pig cecum. Instead, a HP-LF diet had stimulatory effects.

In the present study, we investigated the perception of host odorants and its neuronal substrate with regard to host-plant finding behaviour in oligolectic bees. We reconstructed the antennal lobes (AL) in the Salix specialist, Andrena vaga, and counted about 135 glomeruli and thereby less than the approximately 160 in honeybees. Using calcium imaging experiments to measure neural activity in the bee brain, we recorded odorant-evoked activity patterns in the AL of A. vaga and, for comparison, in the generalist honeybee, Apis mellifera. Our physiological experiments demonstrated that A. vaga bees were particularly sensitive to 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, a behaviour-mediating odorant of Salix host flowers. We found more sensitive glomeruli in the specialised bees as compared to generalist honeybees.

Moths altered their foraging behavior when placed in low humidity environments by increasing the volume of nectar imbibed and by consuming more dilute nectar. When placed in high humidity environments the total volume imbibed decreased, because moths consumed less from dilute nectars (water and 12 % sucrose). Survivorship was higher with higher humidity. Daily foraging patterns changed with relative humidity (RH): moths maximized their nectar consumption earlier, at lower humidities. Although ambient humidity had an impact on foraging activity, activity levels and nectar preferences, total energy intake was not affected. These results show that foraging decisions made by M. sexta kept under different ambient RH levels allow individuals to meet their osmotic demands while maintaining a constant energy input.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This requires animals which have clear relationships between behavior and corresponding neural activities. Insects are precisely such animals and one of the adaptive behaviors of insects is high-accuracy odor source orientation. The most direct way to know the relationships between neural activity and behavior is by recording neural activities in a brain from freely behaving insects. There is also a method to give stimuli mimicking the natural environment to tethered insects allowing insects to walk or fly at the same position. In addition to these methods an ‘insect–machine hybrid system’ is proposed, which is another experimental system meeting the conditions necessary for approaching the dynamic processing in the brain of insects for generating adaptive behavior. This insect–machine hybrid system is an experimental system which has a mobile robot as its body. The robot is controlled by the insect through its behavior or the neural activities recorded from the brain. As we can arbitrarily control the motor output of the robot, we can intervene at the relationship between the insect and the environmental conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Although eel vagal nerve consisted of five branches, other branches (X2, X3, X4 and X5) did not influence the esophageal pressure. When the X1 nerve branch was stimulated electrically, the balloon pressure in the UES area increased with optimum frequency of 20 Hz. Since similar optimum frequency was observed both in the pithed eel and in the isolated UES preparation, such characteristic of X1 nerve is not due to anesthetic used during experiment. As the isolated UES preparation consists of muscle cells and nerve terminals, and as the optimum frequency of the nerve terminal is identical with that of the X1 branch, it is most likely that the X1 nerve branch is identical with the nerve terminals within the UES preparation. On the other hand, since the GVC neurons fire spontaneously at around 20 Hz, the optimum frequency of 20 Hz means that the eel UES is usually closed vigorously and relaxed only when the GVC neuron is inactivated. The effect of X1 stimulation was inhibited by curare, but not by atropine, indicating that the X1 nerve branch releases acetylcholine, which acts on the nicotinic receptor on the UES striated muscle. Beside vagal nerve X1 branch, spinal nerve SN2, SN3 and SN4 also contributed to the UES closure, but SN1 did not influence the UES movement. However, since the efficacy of these spinal nerve stimulations is about 1/10 of that by vagal X1 branch, the eel UES may be controlled primarily by a vagal nerve X1 branch, and secondarily by spinal nerves (SN2, SN3 and SN4).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The results show that E. calcaratus produces weak advertisement calls of about 72 dB sound pressure level (SPL) at 0.25 m from the caller. The signals are affected by attenuation and degradation patterns as they propagate in their native environment, reaching average values of 61 and 51 dB SPL at 1 and 2 m from the sound source, respectively.

However, their diet may include fruits, buds, petioles, and flowers, as well as leaves, suggesting they must cope with variations in the nutrient composition of their food. We studied the physiological basis of the dietary flexibility of these monkeys by comparing food choice, digestive performance and patterns of digesta flow in six adults, fed diets of either leaves or a mixture of fruit and leaves. Although monkeys ate similar amounts of the two diets, they ingested more digestible protein when offered the leaf diet, on which they lost body mass, but they ingested much more soluble sugars when offered fruit and leaves on which they gained mass. Digestibilities of dry matter, fat, energy and fibre did not differ between diets, but those of crude protein, soluble sugars and minerals were higher on the fruit–leaf diet. Mean retention times in the gut of solute (Co-EDTA) and particulate markers (Cr-mordanted cell walls) did not differ between diets, but on both diets the monkeys retained the particulate marker (mean retention time ca 55 h) for longer than they did the solute marker (MRT ca 50 h).

Liver glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalyses the final step in glucose production and is central to glucose regulation in other animals. G6Pase comprises a translocase (SLC37A4) and a catalytic subunit (G6PC). G6PC and SLC37A4 expression and activity are normally regulated by nutritional state and glucostatic hormones, particularly insulin, and are elevated in diabetes. We tested the hypotheses that (1) grey seal G6PC and SLC37A4 cDNA and predicted protein sequences differ from other species’ at functional sites, (2) relative G6Pase protein abundances are lower during feeding than fasting and (3) relative G6Pase protein abundances are related to insulin, insulin receptor phosphorylation and key metabolite levels. We show that G6PC and partial SLC37A4 cDNA sequences encode proteins sharing 82–95 % identity with other mammals. Seal G6PC contained no differences in sites responsible for activity, stability or subcellular location. Several substitutions in seal SLC37A4 were predicted to be tolerated with low probability, which could affect glucose production. Suckling pups had higher relative abundance of both subunits than healthy, postweaned fasting pups. Furthermore, relative G6PC abundance was negatively related to glucose levels. These findings contrast markedly with the response of relative hepatic G6Pase abundance to feeding, fasting, insulin, insulin sensitivity and key metabolites in other animals, and highlight the need to understand the regulation of enzymes involved in glucose control in phocids if these animals are to be informative models of diabetes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Total plasma androgens and body mass residuals were positively associated in males, but showed no association in females. The maximal CORT elevation after handling stress in this single-clutching species was of comparable magnitude to responses in related multi-clutching lizard species with longer breeding seasons.

The contribution of the parallel anatomic arrangement to total vascular R (RT), independent of blood viscosity, is unknown. We measured pulmonary (RP) and systemic (RS) vascular R with an in situ Ringer’s solution perfusion technique using anesthetized anuran and urodele species to determine: (1) relative contributions of vascular anatomy and blood viscosity to RT; (2) distensibility index (%Δ flow kPa−1) of the pulmonary and systemic vascular circuits; and (3) interspecific correlates of variation in these parameters with red blood cell size, cardiac power output, and aerobic capacities. RP was lower than RS in anurans, while RP of the urodeles was greater than RS and significantly greater than anuran RP. Anuran RT was lowest and did not vary interspecifically, whereas urodele RT was significantly greater than anuran, and varied interspecifically. Pulmonary and systemic circuit distensibility differences may explain cardiac shunt patterns in toads with changes in cardiac output from rest to activity. When blood viscosity was taken into account, vascular resistance accounted for about 25 % of RT while blood viscosity accounted for the remaining 75 %. Owing to lower RT, terrestrial anuran species required lower cardiac power outputs when moving fluid through their vasculature compared to aquatic species. These results indicate that physical characteristics of the vasculature can account for interspecific differences in cardiovascular physiology and suggest a co-evolution of cardiac and vascular anatomy among amphibians.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this movement, which is analogous to saccadic eye movement in mammals, head stabilization plays an important role in stabilizing the retinal image.

Previous studies focusing on anatomical and behavioral features have pointed out that visual information is also important for diving birds, indicating its significance in the head movements of diving birds. In the present study, the kinematic and behavioral features of head bobbing in diving little grebes were described by motion analysis to identify the head movement in diving birds. The results showed that head-bobbing stroke (HBS) consisted of a thrust phase and a hold phase as is typical for head bobbing during walking birds. This suggests that HBS is related to visual stabilization under water. In HBS, grebes tended to dive with longer stroke length and smaller stroke frequency than in non-bobbing stroke. This suggests that the behavior, which is related to vision, affects the kinematic stroke parameters. This clarification of underwater head movement will help in our understanding not only of vision, but also of the kinematic strategy of diving birds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The fuel mixture of long distance migrant birds can also be affected by the rate of water loss, where birds catabolize more protein to increase endogenous water production under dehydrating flight conditions. Despite many studies investigating flight metabolism, few have focused on the metabolic response to flight during the switchover to fat catabolism in migrants, and none have examined the effect of ambient conditions on fuel selection during early flight. We investigated the effect of water loss on the metabolic response to short duration flight in the American robin (Turdus migratorius). Birds were flown in a climatic wind tunnel and changes in body composition and plasma metabolites were measured. As flight duration increased, there was a gradual switchover from carbohydrate and protein catabolism to fat catabolism. Plasma metabolite profiles indicate that the mobilization of fat occurred within 20 min of initiating flight. Plasma glucose decreased and uric acid increased with flight duration. Ambient humidity did not affect fuel mixture. Thus, it seems that the utilization of fat may be delayed as migrants initiate flight. Short-hop migrants may exploit high rates of endogenous water production resulting from carbohydrate and protein catabolism early in flight to offset high water loss associated with low humidity. Rapid catabolism of lean body components at the start of a flight also reduces mass quickly, and may reduce energy costs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

PNAS 105:13451–13455, 2008; Burda et al. PNAS 106:5708–5713, 2009). Nonetheless, a subsequent study from a different laboratory did not confirm this phenomenon (Hert et al. J Comp Physiol A 197:677–682, 2011). The aim of our study was to enlarge the pool of independently gained data on this remarkable animal behavior. By satellite snapshots analysis and using blinded protocol we scored positions of 2,235 individuals in 74 herds. Our results are in line with the original findings of prevailing N–S orientation of grazing cattle. In addition, we found that mutual distances between individual animals within herds (herd density) affect their N–S preference—a new phenomenon giving some insight into biological significance of alignment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Physiological rates were measured at the maintenance temperature (17 °C), and compared with measurements performed at 10 and 24 °C after 16 h and 14 days to analyze acute and acclimated responses, respectively. Metabolic rates (both RMR and SMR) differed significantly between F and S seeds, irrespective of temperature. Mass-specific CRs were not different for F and S seeds but were significantly higher in F clams for rates standardized according to allometric size-scaling rules. Acute thermal dependency of CR was equal for F and S clams: mean Q10 were ≈3 and 2 in temperature ranges of 10–17 and 17–24 °C, respectively. CR did not change after 2 weeks of acclimation to temperatures. Acute thermal effects on SMR were similar in both groups (Q10 ≈ 1 and 1.6 in temperature ranges of 10–17 and 17–24 °C, respectively). Large differences between groups were found in the acute thermal dependence of RMR: Q10 in F clams (≈1.2 and 1.9 at temperature ranges of 10–17 and 17–24 °C, respectively) were similar to those found for SMR (Q10 = 1.0 and 1.7). In contrast, RMR of S clams exhibited maximum thermal dependence (Q10 = 3.1) at 10–17 °C and become depressed at higher temperatures (Q10 = 0.9 at 17–24 °C). A recovery of RMR in S clams was recorded upon acclimation to 24 °C. Contrasting metabolic patterns between fast and slow growers are interpreted as a consequence of differential thermal sensitivity of the fraction of metabolism associated to food processing and assimilation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To test predictions concerning the role of insularity and low predation risk as factors selecting for the use of torpor, and the evolution of low basal metabolic rate in island species, we examined thermoregulation under laboratory and semi-natural conditions in a mainland species, the African Green Pigeon (Treron calvus). Under laboratory conditions, rest-phase body temperature (Tb) was significantly and positively correlated with air temperature (Ta) between 0 and 35 °C, and the relationship between resting metabolic rate (RMR) and Ta differed from typical endothermic patterns. The minimum RMR, which we interpret as basal metabolic rate (BMR), was 0.825 ± 0.090 W. Green pigeons responded to food restriction by significantly decreasing rest-phase Tb, but the reductions were small (at most ~5 °C below normothermic values), with a minimum Tb of 33.1 °C recorded in a food-deprived bird. We found no evidence of the large reductions in Tb and metabolic rate and the lethargic state characteristic of torpor. The absence of torpor in T. calvus lends support to the idea that species restricted to islands that are free of predators are more likely to use torpor than mainland species that face the risk of predation during the rest-phase. We also analysed interspecific variation in columbid BMR in a phylogenetically informed framework and verified the conclusions of an earlier study which found that BMR is significantly lower in island species compared to those that occur on mainlands.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Yet we know very little about the ontogeny of monoaminergic systems and whether they contribute to the development of social behavior. Anurans are an excellent model for studying the development of social behavior because one of its primary components, phonotaxis, is expressed early in life. To examine the effect of social signals on monoamines early in ontogeny, we presented juvenile Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata) with a male mating call or no sound and measured norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and a serotonin metabolite, across the brain using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Our results demonstrate that adult-like monoaminergic systems are in place shortly after metamorphosis. Perhaps more interestingly, we found that mating calls increased the level of monoamines in the juvenile tegmentum, a midbrain region involved in sensory-motor integration and that contributes to brain arousal and attention. We saw no such increase in the auditory midbrain or in forebrain regions. We suggest that changes in monoamine levels in the juvenile tegmentum may reflect the effects of social signals on arousal state and could contribute to context-dependent modulation of social behavior.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the biogenic amine octopamine plays a crucial role in appetitive odor learning, but little is known about how octopamine affects the brain. We investigated its effect in the antennal lobe, the first olfactory center in the brain, using calcium imaging to record background activity and odor responses before and after octopamine application. We show that octopamine increases background activity in olfactory output neurons, while reducing average calcium levels. Odor responses were modulated both upwards and downwards, with more odor response increases in glomeruli with negative or weak odor responses. Importantly, the octopamine effect was variable across glomeruli, odorants, odorant concentrations and animals, suggesting that the octopaminergic network is shaped by plasticity depending on an individual animal’s history and possibly other factors. Using RNA interference, we show that the octopamine receptor AmOA1 (homolog of the Drosophila OAMB receptor) is involved in the octopamine effect. We propose a network model in which octopamine receptors are plastic in their density and located on a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons in a disinhibitory pathway. This would improve odor-coding of behaviorally relevant, previously experienced odors.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Fish are an excellent model for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation.

Some signaling pathways, such as redox status, AMPK, MAPK and IGF/PI3K/Akt, are known to play a central role in hypoxia adaptation. These networks regulate oxygen-sensitive transcription factors which, in turn, affect the expression of hypoxia adaptation-related genes.

They have little difficulty navigating the turbid waterways, which often contain obstacles that they must circumnavigate. Anatomical and behavioral research suggests that the vibrissae and associated follicle–sinus complexes that manatees possess over their entire body form a sensory array system for detecting hydrodynamic stimuli analogous to the lateral line system of fish. This is consistent with data highlighting that manatees are tactile specialists, evidenced by their specialized facial morphology and use of their vibrissae during feeding and active investigation/manipulation of objects. Two Florida manatees were tested in a go/no-go procedure using a staircase method to assess their ability to detect low-frequency water movement. Hydrodynamic vibrations were created by a sinusoidally oscillating sphere that generated a dipole field at frequencies from 5 to 150 Hz, which are below the apparent functional hearing limit of the manatee. The manatees detected particle displacement of less than 1 μm for frequencies of 15–150 Hz and of less than a nanometer at 150 Hz. Restricting the facial vibrissae with various size mesh openings indicated that the specialized sensory hairs played an important role in the manatee’s exquisite tactile sensitivity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We use a comparative approach toward contrasting olfactory coding and the behavioral efficacy of mixtures in different insect species, and organize these topics around four sections: (1) Examples of the behavioral efficacy of odor mixtures and the olfactory environment; (2) mixture processing in the periphery; (3) mixture coding in the antennal lobe; and (4) evolutionary implications and adaptations for olfactory processing. We also include pertinent background information about the processing of individual odorants and comparative differences in wiring and anatomy, as these topics have been richly investigated and inform the processing of mixtures in the insect olfactory system.

Energy is supplied as food (often nectar from flowers) or as heat (in sun-tracking or thermogenic plants). The requirements of pollinators for these resources depend on many factors, including the costs of living, locomotion, thermoregulation and behaviour, all of which are influenced by body size. These requirements are modified by the availability of energy offered by plants and environmental conditions. Endothermic insects, birds and bats are very effective, because they move faster and are more independent of environmental temperatures, than are ectothermic insects, but they are energetically costly for the plant. The body size of endothermic pollinators appears to be influenced by opposing requirements of the animals and plants. Large body size is advantageous for endotherms to retain heat. However, plants select for small body size of endotherms, as energy costs of larger size are not matched by increases in flight speed. If high energy costs of endothermy cannot be met, birds and mammals employ daily torpor, and large insects reduce the frequency of facultative endothermy. Energy uptake can be limited by the time required to absorb the energy or eliminate the excess water that comes with it. It can also be influenced by variations in climate that determine temperature and flowering season.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Little evidence exists for polarized light among these visual cues despite extensive orientation by celestial and underwater polarized light in other crustaceans and in insects. We used electroretinography to assess spectral sensitivity in the eye of the beach flea Platorchestia platensis, and behavioral studies to test whether linearly polarized light serves as an orientation cue. Two spectral classes were present in the P. platensis eye with maxima at 431 and 520 nm. Non-uniform orientation of amphipods in the laboratory arena required either light/dark or polarized cues. Scototactic movements depended on arena conditions (day/night, wet/dry), while orientation under linearly polarized light was wavelength-dependent and parallel to the e-vector. Subsequent tests presented conflicting and additive scototactic and polarotactic cues to differentiate among these responses. In dry conditions, orientation parallel to the polarization e-vector overcame a dominant negative scototaxis, confirming that polarotaxis and scototaxis are separate orientation responses in this species. These behavioral results demonstrate talitrid amphipods can perceive and orient to linearly polarized light, and may use it to orient toward preferred zones on beaches.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Unlike voice cues that affect all calls of an animal, signature whistles are distinct whistle types carrying identity information in their frequency modulation pattern. Signature whistle development is influenced by vocal production learning. Animals use a whistle from their environment as a model, but modify it, and thus invent a novel signal. Dolphins also copy signature whistles of others, effectively addressing the whistle owner. This copying occurs at low rates and the resulting copies are recognizable as such by parameter variations in the copy. Captive dolphins can learn to associate novel whistles with objects and use these whistles to report on the presence or absence of the object. If applied to signature whistles, this ability would make the signature whistle a rare example of a learned referential signal in animals. Here, we review the history of signature whistle research, covering definitions, acoustic features, information content, contextual use, developmental aspects, and species comparisons with mammals and birds. We show how these signals stand out amongst recognition calls in animals and how they contribute to our understanding of complexity in animal communication.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A review of recent evidence,"For millennia, dolphins have intrigued humans. Scientific study has confirmed that bottlenose dolphins are large-brained, highly social mammals with an extended developmental period, flexible cognitive capacities, and powerful acoustic abilities including a sophisticated echolocation system. These findings have led some to ask if dolphins experience aspects of consciousness. Recent investigations targeting self-recognition/self-awareness and metacognition, constructs tied to consciousness on some accounts, have analyzed the dolphin’s ability to recognize itself in a mirror or on a video as well as to monitor its own knowledge in a perceptual categorization task. The current article reviews this work with dolphins and grapples with some of the challenges in designing, conducting, and interpreting these studies as well as with general issues related to studying consciousness in animals. The existing evidence does not provide a convincing case for consciousness in dolphins. For productive scientific work on consciousness in dolphins (and other animals including humans), we need clearer characterizations of consciousness, better methods for studying it, and appropriate paradigms for interpreting outcomes.

With the transition from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment, the different physical properties of air and water required new adaptations. Many mammalian species still live in both worlds, and we include these semi-aquatic mammals in our present definition of aquatic mammals. This special issue on the ‘‘Sensory biology of aquatic mammals’’ presents reviews and original studies on most major taxa that have been studied so far. The authors of original studies were encouraged to extend the discussion part to aid the nonspecialist reader in gaining an overview. This special issue is closely related to, but not exactly congruent with, an international conference with the same title that was held at the Marine Science Center in Rostock, Germany, in October 2012. Marine mammals are the most extensively studied group of aquatic mammals. This is partly due to the fact that they represent the majority of species of aquatic mammals. Furthermore, marine mammals have often been more relevant economically to humans than freshwater species, e.g. in fisheries or whaling. And last but not least, people have a deeply rooted fascination for marine mammals. Maybe this is founded in the awareness that in the animal kingdom marine mammals are our close relatives, but at the same time they easily roam the last unexplored areas of the earth, where humans have not really managed to follow them even with modern technology. The three major groups of marine mammals are the pinnipeds, the cetaceans and the sirenians (dugong and manatees). They are covered by original work and a review in this special issue. In addition, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) are counted among the marine mammals. For information on the sensory biology of the polar bear, the reader is referred to Nachtigall et al. (2007); for the sea otter, to Murphy et al. (1990) and Ghoul and Reichmuth (2012); for marine mammals in general, to Supin et al. (2001), Dehnhardt (2002) and Thewissen and Nummela (2008). All major clades of marine mammals also include species that live fully or partly in fresh water, such as the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica), two families of river dolphins (Iniidae and Platinistidae), dolphins of the genera Sotalia, Sousa and Orcaella, and the manatees (Trichechus). Aquatic mammals originally living in limnic waters have also attracted a lot of attention. In the present special issue, they are represented by an insectivore and a monotreme, the American water shrew (see article by K. C. Catania) and the duck-billed platypus (see article by N. Czech-Damal et al.). The anatomy of some sensory systems was also studied in other originally limnic mammals: the otters of the genus Lutra, the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), the beavers (Castor spp.) and the Australian water rat (Hydromys chrysogaster).

Currently, no studies have been conducted on small systemic arteries from wild birds. We hypothesized that ACh-mediated vasodilation of isolated small arteries from mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) would likewise depend on endothelial-derived factors. Small resistance mesenteric and cranial tibial (c. tibial) arteries (80–150 μm, inner diameter) were cannulated and pre-constricted to 50 % of resting inner diameter with phenylephrine then exposed to increasing concentrations of ACh (10−9–10−5 M) or the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10−12–10−3 M). For mesenteric arteries, ACh-mediated vasodilation was significantly blunted with the potassium channel antagonist tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, 10 mM); whereas responses were only moderately impaired with endothelial disruption or inhibition of prostaglandins (indomethacin, 10 μM). In contrast, endothelial disruption as well as exposure to TEA largely abolished vasodilatory responses to ACh in c. tibial arteries while no effect of prostaglandin inhibition was observed. For both vascular beds, responses to ACh were moderately dependent on the NO signaling pathway. Inhibition of NO synthase had no impact, despite complete reversal of phenylephrine-mediated tone with SNP, whereas inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) caused minor impairments. Endothelium-independent vasodilation also relied on potassium channels. In summary, ACh-mediated vasodilation of mesenteric and c. tibial arteries occurs through the activation of potassium channels to induce hyperpolarization with moderate reliance on sGC. Prostaglandins likewise play a small role in the vasodilatory response to ACh in mesenteric arteries.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

There have been many attempts to estimate these costs to mammalian herbivores in terms of energy, but this ignores what may be a more important cost—increases in protein turnover and concomitant losses of amino acids. We measured the effect of varying dietary protein concentrations on the ingestion of two PSMs (1,8 cineole—a monoterpene, and benzoic acid—an aromatic carboxylic acid) by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). The dietary protein concentration had a small effect on how much cineole possums ingested. In contrast, protein had a large effect on how much benzoate they ingested, especially at high dietary concentrations of benzoate. This prompted us to measure the effects of dietary protein and benzoate on whole-body protein turnover using the end-product method following an oral dose of [15N] glycine. Increasing the concentration of dietary protein in diets without PSMs improved N balance but did not influence whole-body protein turnover. In contrast, feeding benzoate in a low-protein diet pushed animals into negative N balance. The concomitant increases in the rates of whole-body protein turnover in possums eating diets with more benzoate were indicative of a protein cost of detoxification. This was about 30 % of the dietary N intake and highlights the significant effects that PSMs can have on nutrient metabolism and retention.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

These whales ensonify thousands of organisms per dive but select only about 25 prey for capture. They negotiate their cluttered environment by radiating sound in a narrow 20° field of view which they sample with 1.5–3 clicks per metre travelled requiring only some 60 clicks to locate, select and approach each prey. Sampling rates do not appear to be defined by the range to individual targets, but rather by the movement of the predator. Whales sample faster when they encounter patches of prey allowing them to search new water volumes while turning rapidly to stay within a patch. This implies that the Griffin search–approach–capture model of biosonar foraging must be expanded to account for sampling behaviours adapted to the overall prey distribution. Beaked whales can classify prey at more than 15 m range adopting stereotyped motor patterns when approaching some prey. This long detection range relative to swimming speed facilitates a deliberate mode of sensory-motor operation in which prey and capture tactics can be selected to optimize energy returns during long breath-hold dives.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The molecular mass of the α and β chains of the cathodic component as well as the 2 α and 4 β of the anodic components were determined. Analysis of the intact α and β chains from cathodic hemoglobin and their proteolytic digestion products by high-resolution MS and MS/MS experiments resulted in 92 and 95 % sequence coverage of the α and β globins, respectively. The oxygen binding properties of both hemoglobin components were analyzed with respect to their interactions with their physiological effectors. Stripped cathodic hemoglobin displayed the highest oxygen affinity among Anguilliformes with no significant effect of pH on O2-affinity. In the presence of both chloride and organic phosphates, O2-affinity was strongly reduced, and cooperativity was enhanced; moreover, cathodic hemoglobin contains two indistinguishable GTP-binding sites. Stripped anodic hemoglobins exhibited both low O2-affinity and low cooperativity and a larger Bohr effect than cathodic hemoglobin.

In the present study, we investigated thermal dependence of cholinergic and adrenergic cardiovascular tone in embryonic American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) and assessed possible phenotypic plasticity in a chronic hypoxic incubation treatment. We compared changes in heart rate (fH) and mean arterial blood pressure (PM) for chronically hypoxic and normoxic-incubated embryos after cholinergic and adrenergic blockade following three different acute temperature treatments: (1) 30 °C (control incubation temperature), (2) acute, progressive decrease 30–24 °C then held at 24 °C, and (3) acute, progressive increase 30–36 °C then held at 36 °C. fH progressively fell in response to decreasing temperature and rose in response to increasing temperature. PM did not significantly change with decreasing temperature, but was lowered significantly with increasing acute temperature in the normoxic group at 90 % of development only. Propranolol administration (β adrenergic antagonist) produced a significant fH decrease at 24, 30, and 36 °C that was similar at all temperatures for all groups. For normoxic-incubated embryos at 90 % of development, atropine administration (cholinergic antagonist) significantly increased fH in both 24 and 36 °C treatments, but not in the 30 °C control treatment.

Previous research has documented that RVM correlates with dehydration tolerance and maximal aerobic capacity in amphibians. The power output (mW g−1 ventricle mass) and stroke work (mJ g−1 ventricle muscle mass) were independent of RVM and were indistinguishable from previously published results for fish and reptiles. RVM was significantly correlated with maximum power output (Pmax, mW kg−1 body mass), stroke volume, cardiac output, afterload pressure (PO) at Pmax, and preload pressure (PI) at Pmax. PI at Pmax and PO at Pmax also correlated very closely with each other. The increases in both PI and PO at maximal power outputs in large hearts suggest that concomitant increases in blood volume and/or increased modulation of vascular compliance either anatomically or via sympathetic tone on the venous vasculature would be necessary to achieve Pmax in vivo. Hypotheses for variation in RVM and its concomitant increased Pmax in amphibians are developed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The essential amino acid, l-methionine, at 20 mM significantly (p < 0.0001) inhibited the 2-min uptakes of 1 mM 3H-l-leucine in both Na+- and K+-containing incubation media. The residual 3H-l-leucine uptake in the two media were significantly greater than zero (p < 0.001), but not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05) and may represent an l-methionine- and cation-independent transport system. 3H-l-leucine influxes in both NaCl and KCl incubation media were hyperbolic functions of [l-leucine], following the carrier-mediated Michaelis–Menten equation. In NaCl, 3H-l-leucine influx displayed a low apparent KM (high affinity) and low apparent Jmax, while in KCl the transport exhibited a high apparent KM (low affinity) and high apparent Jmax. l-methionine or l-phenylalanine (7 and 20 mM) were competitive inhibitors of 3H-l-leucine influxes in both NaCl and KCl media, producing a significant (p < 0.01) increase in 3H-l-leucine influx KM, but no significant response in 3H-l-leucine influx Jmax. Potassium was a competitive inhibitor of sodium co-transport with 3H-l-leucine, significantly (p < 0.01) increasing 3H-l-leucine influx KM in the presence of sodium, but having negligible effect on 3H-l-leucine influx Jmax in the same medium. These results suggest that shrimp BBMV transport 3H-l-leucine by a single l-methionine- and l-phenylalanine-shared carrier system that is enhanced by acidic pH and can be stimulated by either Na+ or K+ acting as co-transport drivers binding to shared activator sites.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique, hearing thresholds were determined in four age-classes of hapuka, from larvae to juveniles. The youngest age-class had poor hearing abilities, with lowest thresholds of 132 dB re 1 μPa, and a narrow auditory bandwidth (100–800 Hz). Hearing ability improved significantly throughout the remainder of their first year, including decreases in thresholds of up to 27 dB, and an increase in auditory bandwidth (up to 1,000 Hz). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate structural mechanisms that may account for this ontogenetic improvement in hearing. These showed rostral extensions of the swim bladder developing early in the juvenile stage, and extending with increasing age closer to the otic capsule. It is suggested that this indirect connection between the swim bladder and the otic capsule could impart pressure sensitivity closer to the inner ear, accounting for the increase in sensitivity seen during development, although further investigation of older fish is required for conclusive evidence. The improvement in hearing ability in hapuka could be potentially related to a unique life history of extended pelagic durations up to 4 years.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We hypothesized that head-bobbing is a unique prey-processing behaviour, which alternatively could be structurally and functionally analogous with raking in basal teleosts, or with pharyngognathy in neoteleosts. Modulation of head-bobbing was elicited by prey with different motility and toughness. Head-bobbing involved sustained mouth occlusion and pronounced cranial elevation, similar to raking. However, the hyoid and pectoral girdle were protracted, and not retracted as in both raking and pharyngognathy. High-speed videofluoroscopy of hyoid movements confirmed that head-bobbing differs from other known aquatic prey-processing behaviours. Nevertheless, head-bobbing and other prey-processing behaviours converge on a recurrent functional theme in the trophic ecology of aquatic feeding vertebrates; the use of intraoral and oropharyngeal dentition surfaces to immobilize, reduce and process relatively large, tough or motile prey. Prey processing outside the pharyngeal region has not been described for neoteleosts previously, but morphological evidence suggests that relatives of Betta might use similar processing behaviours. Thus, our results suggest that pharyngognathy did not out-compete ancestral prey-processing mechanisms completely during the evolution of neoteleosts.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Parallel processing is a common principle of sensory systems supporting this task, for example in visual and auditory systems, but its role in olfaction remained unclear. Studies in the honeybee focused on a dual olfactory pathway. Two sets of projection neurons connect glomeruli in two antennal-lobe hemilobes via lateral and medial tracts in opposite sequence with the mushroom bodies and lateral horn. Comparative studies suggest that this dual-tract circuit represents a unique adaptation in Hymenoptera. Imaging studies indicate that glomeruli in both hemilobes receive redundant sensory input. Recent simultaneous multi-unit recordings from projection neurons of both tracts revealed widely overlapping response profiles strongly indicating parallel olfactory processing. Whereas lateral-tract neurons respond fast with broad (generalistic) profiles, medial-tract neurons are odorant specific and respond slower. In analogy to “what-” and “where” subsystems in visual pathways, this suggests two parallel olfactory subsystems providing “what-” (quality) and “when” (temporal) information. Temporal response properties may support across-tract coincidence coding in higher centers. Parallel olfactory processing likely enhances perception of complex odorant mixtures to decode the diverse and dynamic olfactory world of a social insect.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Female presence should increase the expression of male signal traits relevant for mate-choice, while male presence should promote the enhancement of traits involved in male-male competition. The electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio produces a biphasic electric pulse for electrolocation and communication. Pulse amplitude predicts the signaler’s body size while pulse duration predicts circulating androgen levels. Males enhance pulse amplitude and duration when the numbers of males and females increase simultaneously. Here we tested the relative effects of female presence and male presence on male signal enhancement, and whether the size of the male competitor affected this enhancement. We found that male presence drives the enhancement of both pulse amplitude and second phase duration, independently of the size of the male competitor. Female presence induces the enhancement of pulse duration, but not pulse amplitude. These data suggest that males probably attend to information about a competitor’s body size coded by pulse amplitude and attend to aggressiveness coded by a competitor’s pulse duration, both potential predictors of fight outcome. Females may be primarily concerned about information on reproductive condition coded by pulse duration.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Insect photoreceptors vary in response speed between different species, but recently it has also been shown that different spectral photoreceptor classes within a species possess diverse response characteristics. However, it has not been quantified what roles phototransduction and membrane properties play in such diversity. Here, we use electrophysiological methods in combination with system analysis to study whether the membrane properties could create the variation of the response speed found in the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) photoreceptors. We recorded intracellular responses from each photoreceptor class to white noise-modulated current stimuli and defined their input resistance and linear filtering properties. We found that green sensitive cells exhibit smaller input resistance and membrane impedance than other cell classes. Since green sensitive cells are the fastest photoreceptor class in the bumblebee retina, our results suggest that the membrane filtering properties are correlated with the speed of light responses across the spectral classes.

The first process could be responsible for the reaction times (mean about 400 ms) of the nerve impulses at threshold. The second process has been postulated for flux detectors such as olfactory sensilla of moths. The odorant deactivation could involve a modification of the pheromone-binding protein (PBP) that “locks” the pheromone inside the inner binding cavity of the protein. The model combines seemingly contradictory functions of the PBP such as pheromone transport, protection of the pheromone from enzymatic degradation, pheromone deactivation, and pheromone–receptor interaction. Model calculations reveal a density of at least 6,000 receptor molecules per µm2 of neuronal membrane. The volatile decanoyl-thio-1,1,1-trifluoropropanone specifically blocks pheromone receptor neurons, probably when bound to the PBP and by competitive binding to the receptor molecules.

Previous comparisons between aerial and underwater hearing capabilities have considered media-dependent differences relative to auditory anatomy, acoustic communication, ecology, and amphibious life history. New data for several species, including recently published audiograms and previously unreported measurements obtained in quiet conditions, necessitate a re-evaluation of amphibious hearing in pinnipeds. Several findings related to underwater hearing are consistent with earlier assessments, including an expanded frequency range of best hearing in true seals that spans at least six octaves. The most notable new results indicate markedly better aerial sensitivity in two seals (Phoca vitulina and Mirounga angustirostris) and one sea lion (Zalophus californianus), likely attributable to improved ambient noise control in test enclosures. An updated comparative analysis alters conventional views and demonstrates that these amphibious pinnipeds have not necessarily sacrificed aerial hearing capabilities in favor of enhanced underwater sound reception.

Our first objective was to investigate the physiology of individual rainbow trout in 4-fish hierarchies. Our second was to compare conclusions drawn from grouping physiological data on the basis of social rank with those based on relating individual physiology to individual aggressive behavior. To create a social hierarchy, groups of 4 juvenile trout were fed (1 % ration) using a darkened feeding container, twice daily (morning and evening). Each morning feeding was videotaped to record aggressive behavior, thereby facilitating the assignment of a social status rank to each fish. On days 5 and 10–11, physiological parameters were measured in fish fasted for 24 h. Social hierarchies formed in all tested groups. One fish would become dominant, whereas the three subordinate individuals would each assume a stable social rank. When classified according to this social rank, the three subordinate individuals all displayed similar physiology, different from the physiology of the dominant fish. The latter included higher ammonia excretion rate, greater protein utilization in aerobic metabolism, greater feeding, higher specific growth rate, greater increase in condition factor, and lower routine oxygen consumption rate. However, when individual aggression was taken into account, a continuous gradient was observed between aggression and physiology for most parameters, regardless of social status. These relationships could be improved by normalizing the aggression score to the overall level of aggression in each hierarchy. We argue that individual behavior should be considered instead of just social rank when studying the physiology of trout in social hierarchies.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hibernation is made up of energy-saving torpor bouts [periods of controlled reduction in body temperature (Tb)], which are interrupted by brief periodic arousals to normothermic Tb. What triggers these arousals in free-ranging hibernators is not well understood. Some temperate bats with intermittent access to flying insects during winter synchronize arousals with sunset, which suggests that, in some species, feeding opportunities influence arousal timing. We tested whether hibernating bats from a cold climate without access to food during winter also maintain a circadian rhythm for arousals or whether cues from conspecifics in the same cluster are more important. We used temperature telemetry to monitor skin temperature (Tsk) of free-ranging little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) hibernating in central Manitoba, Canada, where temperatures from 22 October to 22 March were too cold for flying insects. We found no evidence bats synchronized arousals with photoperiod but they did arouse synchronously with other bats in the same cluster. Thus, in the northern part of their range where flying insects are almost never available during winter, little brown bats exhibit no circadian pattern to arousals. Warming synchronously with others could reduce the energetic costs of arousal for individuals or could reflect disturbance of torpid bats by cluster-mates.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hypoxic depression of plasma [non-esterified fatty acids] (NEFA), an important cardiac aerobic fuel, is a common response in many species of hypoxia-tolerant fishes, including tilapia. We tested the hypothesis that decreased plasma [NEFA] is important for maintaining stable cardiac function during and following hypoxia exposure, based on the premise that continued reliance upon cardiac fatty acid metabolism under such conditions could impair cardiac function. We examined the effect of severe hypoxia exposure (PO2 < 0.2 kPa) on routine and maximum performance of the in situ perfused tilapia heart under conditions of routine (400 μmol L−1) and low (75 μmol L−1) [palmitate], which mimicked the in vivo levels of plasma [NEFA] found in normoxic and hypoxic tilapia, respectively. Under both concentrations of palmitate, the in situ tilapia heart showed exceptional hypoxic performance as a result of a high maximum glycolytic potential, confirming our previous results using a perfusate without fatty acids. We additionally provide evidence suggesting that non-contractile ATP demand is depressed in tilapia heart during hypoxia exposure. Cardiac performance during and following severe hypoxia exposure was unaffected by the level of palmitate. Thus, we conclude that hypoxic depression of plasma [NEFA] in fishes does not play a role in cardiac hypoxia tolerance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In birds, limiting resources can affect growth as nestlings, but also fitness and survival as adults. Following periods of food restriction, individuals may accelerate development, undergoing a period of rapid “catch-up” growth, in an attempt to reach the appropriate size at adulthood. Previous studies of altricial birds have shown that catch-up growth can have negative consequences in adulthood, although this has not been explored in species with different developmental strategies. Here, we investigated the effects of resource limitation and the subsequent period of catch-up growth, on the morphological and metabolic phenotype of adult Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), a species with a precocial developmental strategy. Because males and females differ in adult body size, we also test whether food restriction had sex-specific effects. Birds that underwent food restriction early in development had muscles of similar size and functional maturity, but lower adult body mass than controls. There was no evidence of sex-specific sensitivity of food restriction on adult body mass; however, there was evidence for body size. Females fed ad lib were larger than males fed ad lib, while females subjected to food restriction were of similar size to males. Adults that had previously experienced food restriction did not have an elevated metabolic rate, suggesting that in contrast to altricial nestlings, there was no metabolic carry-over effect of catch-up growth into adulthood. While Japanese quail can undergo accelerated growth after re-feeding, timing of food restriction may be important to adult size, particularly in females. However, greater developmental flexibility compared to altricial birds may contribute to the lack of metabolic carryover effects at adulthood.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Furthermore, our study provides evidence for a wavelength-dependent effect of light on magnetic compass orientation in amphibians. Tadpoles trained and then tested under full-spectrum light displayed magnetic compass orientation that coincided with the trained shore-deep water axes of their training tanks. Conversely, tadpoles trained under long-wavelength (≥500 nm) light and tested under full-spectrum light, and tadpoles trained under full-spectrum light and tested under long-wavelength (≥500 nm) light, exhibited a 90° shift in magnetic compass orientation relative to the trained y-axis direction. Our results are consistent with earlier studies showing that the observed 90° shift in the direction of magnetic compass orientation under long-wavelength (≥500 nm) light is due to a direct effect of light on the underlying magnetoreception mechanism. These findings also show that wavelength-dependent effects of light do not compromise the function of the magnetic compass under a wide range of natural lighting conditions, presumably due to a large asymmetry in the relatively sensitivity of antagonistic short- and long-wavelength inputs to the light-dependent magnetic compass.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Snails rapidly suppressed their metabolism and minimized their water loss using discontinuous gas exchange pattern. The metabolic suppression probably included periods of tissue hypoxia and anaerobism as indicated by accumulation of typical end products of anaerobic metabolism: lactate, alanine and succinate. Though the drought-induced metabolic suppression was sufficient to stimulate moderate increase of supercooling capacity, the seasonally highest levels of supercooling capacity and the highest tolerance to subzero temperatures were tightly linked to hibernation (diapause). Hibernating snails did not survive freezing of their body fluids and instead relied on supercooling strategy which allowed them to survive when air temperatures dropped to as low as −21 °C.

Here, I present a mechanism to facilitate signal transmission in a group of communicating common squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus sciureus). Vocal onsets of a conspecific affect call initiation in all other members of the group in less than 100 ms. The probability of vocal onsets in a range of 100 ms after the beginning of a vocalization of another monkey was significantly decreased compared to the mean probability of call onsets. Additionally, the probability for vocal onsets of conspecifics was significantly increased just a few hundreds of milliseconds after call onset of others. These behavioral data suggest neural mechanisms that suppress vocal output just after the onset of environmental noise, such as vocalizations of conspecifics, and increase the probability of call initiation of group mates shortly after. These findings add new audio–vocal behaviors to the known strategies that modulate signal transmission in vocal communication. The present study will guide future neurobiological studies that explore how the observed audio–vocal behaviors are implemented in the monkey brain.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In ectotherms, variation in environmental temperature can cause parallel changes in skeletal muscle temperature, potentially leading to significant alterations in muscle performance. Endotherms can also undergo meaningful changes in skeletal muscle temperature that can affect muscle performance. Alterations in skeletal muscle temperature can affect contractile performance in both endotherms and ectotherms, changing the rates of force generation and relaxation, shortening velocity, and consequently mechanical power. Such alterations in the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle can in turn affect locomotory performance and behaviour. For instance, as temperature increases, a consequent improvement in limb muscle performance causes some lizard species to be more likely to flee from a potential predator. However, at lower temperatures, they are much more likely to stand their ground, show threatening displays and even bite. There is no consistent pattern in reported effects of temperature on skeletal muscle fatigue resistance. This review focuses on the effects of temperature variation on skeletal muscle performance in vertebrates, and investigates the thermal sensitivity of different mechanical measures of skeletal muscle performance. The plasticity of thermal sensitivity in skeletal muscle performance has been reviewed to investigate the extent to which individuals can acclimate to chronic changes in their thermal environment.

Eye shape was significantly different among foraging modes, with diving and pursuit-diving species having relatively smaller corneal diameters compared to non-diving species. This may be associated with differences in ambient light intensity while foraging or an ability to tightly constrict the pupil in divers in order to facilitate underwater vision. Retinal topography was similar across all species, consisting of an oblique visual streak, a central area of peak cell density, and no discernible fovea. Because the bill faces downwards when the head is held in the normal posture in waterfowl, the visual streak will be held horizontally, allowing the horizon to be sampled with higher visual acuity. Estimates of spatial resolving power were similar among species with only the Canada goose having a higher spatial resolution. Overall, we found no evidence of ecomorphological adaptations to different foraging modes in the retinal ganglion cell layer in waterfowl. Rather, retinal topography in these birds seems to reflect the ‘openness’ of their habitats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The characteristic features of 5-HTP-treated crickets include an elevated posture, enhanced general activity, longer duration of fighting, enhanced rival singing and a decreased ability to produce a clear fight loser. In addition, 5-HTP-treated males showed a slightly delayed latency to spread their mandibles, a decreased number of attacks and an equal potential to win in comparison to controls (physiological solution-treated males). The obtained results imply a significant role for serotonin in the regulation of social status-related behaviors in G. bimaculatus.

Physiological parameters including energy metabolism correlate with the life history such that tropical species with a slower ‘pace of life’ have lower resting and maximal metabolic rates than temperate congeners. To better understand the physiological mechanisms underlying these differences, we investigated the relationship of metabolic capacity, muscle oxidative capacity and activity patterns to variation in life history patterns in American robins (Turdus migratorius), while resident in central North America and Clay-colored robins (Turdus grayi) resident in Panama. We measured summit metabolism $$ \left( {\dot{V}{\text{O}_{2\text{summit}}}} \right) $$ in birds from both tropical and temperate habitats and found that the temperate robins have a 60 % higher metabolic capacity. We also measured the field metabolic rate (FMR) of free-living birds using heart rate (HR) telemetry and found that temperate robins’ daily energy expenditure was also 60 % higher. Thus, $$\dot{V}{\text{O}_{2\text{summit}}} $$ and FMR both reflect life history differences between the species. Further, both species operate at a nearly identical ~50 % of their thermogenic capacity throughout a given day. As a potential mechanism to explain differences in activity and metabolic capacity, we ask whether oxidative properties of flight muscle are altered in accordance with life history variation and found minimal differences in oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. These data demonstrate a close relationship between thermogenic capacity and daily activity in free-living birds. Further, they suggest that the slow pace of life in tropical birds may be related to the maintenance of low activity rather than functional capacity of the muscle tissue.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Not much is known about the classical neurotransmitters of input pathways to the cockroach circadian system. The circadian pacemaker center receives photic input from the compound eye, via unknown excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory entrainment pathways. In addition, neuropeptidergic inputs couple both pacemaker centers. A histamine-immunoreactive centrifugal neuron connects the ventral aMe with projection areas in the lateral protocerebrum and may provide non-photic inputs. To identify neurotransmitters of input pathways to the circadian clock with Fura-2-dependent Ca2+ imaging, primary cell cultures of the adult aMe were stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh), as the most prominent excitatory, and histamine, as common inhibitory neurotransmitter. In most of aMe neurons, ACh application caused dose-dependent increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels via ionotropic nicotinic ACh receptors. These ACh-dependent rises in Ca2+ were mediated by mibefradil-sensitive voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. In contrast, histamine application decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels in only a subpopulation of aMe cells via H2-type histamine receptor chloride channels. Thus, our data suggest that ACh is part of the light entrainment pathway while histamine is involved in a non-photic input pathway to the ventral circadian clock of the Madeira cockroach.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Olfactory signals are mainly used at a distance, whereas gustatory stimuli play an important role when insects directly contact chemical substrates. In noctuid moths, although the antennae are the main olfactory organ, they also bear taste sensilla. These taste sensilla detect sugars and hence are involved in appetitive learning but could also play an important role in food evaluation by detecting salts and bitter substances. To investigate this, we measured the responses of individual taste sensilla on the antennae of Spodoptera littoralis to sugars and salts using tip recordings. We also traced the projections of their neuronal axons into the brain. In each sensillum, we found one or two neurons responding to sugars: one NaCl-responsive and one water-sensitive neuron. Responses of these neurons were dose-dependent and similar across different locations on the antenna. Responses were dependent on the sex for sucrose and on both sex and location for glucose and fructose. We did not observe a spatial map for the projections from specific regions of the antennae to the deutocerebrum or the tritocerebrum/suboesophageal ganglion complex. In accordance with physiological recordings, back-fills from individual sensilla revealed up to four axons, in most cases targeting different projection zones.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Jellyfish were tethered inside a small experimental tank, where the four vertical walls formed light panels. All four panels were lit at the start of an experiment. The shape of the opening in the velarium was recorded in response to switching off different combinations of panels. We found that under the experimental conditions the opening in the velarium assumed three distinct shapes during a swim contraction.

The shape of the opening in the velarium followed the direction of the stimulus as long as the stimulus contained directional information. When the stimulus contained no directional information, the percentage of centred pulses increased and the shape of the off-centred pulses had a random orientation. Removing one rhopalium did not change the directional response of the animals, however, the number of centred pulses increased.

Extracellular recording sites were chosen based on anatomical landmarks, and neurobiotin injections confirmed the location of auditory sites in subdivisions of the magnocellular nucleus.

Results show that oval- and round-shaped targets were most effective, while triangles with the same surface area as oval ‘face like’ targets hardly elicited spitting. The likelihood of spitting depended on neither the presence, the spatial arrangement (horizontal or vertical) nor the surface texture (shiny or matt) of glass eyes.

All species had centro-temporally located foveae that project into the frontal part of the lateral visual field. Visual acuity was the highest in nuthatches, intermediate in titmice, and the lowest in chickadees. Chickadees and titmice had relatively wide binocular fields with a high degree of eye movement right above their short bills probably to converge their eyes while searching for food. Nuthatches had narrower binocular fields with a high degree of eye movement below their bills probably to orient the fovea toward the trunk while searching for food. Chickadees and titmice had higher scanning (e.g., head movement) rates than nuthatches probably due to their wider blind areas that limit visual coverage.

It has been suggested that whiskers could be used to discriminate between different sized objects in one of two ways: (i) to use whisker positions, such as angular position, spread or amplitude to approximate size; or (ii) to calculate the number of whiskers that contact an object. This study describes in detail how two adult harbor seals use their whiskers to differentiate between three sizes of disk. The seals judged size very fast, taking <400 ms. In addition, they oriented their smaller, most rostral, ventral whiskers to the disks, so that more whiskers contacted the surface, complying to a maximal contact sensing strategy. Data from this study supports the suggestion that it is the number of whisker contacts that predict disk size, rather than how the whiskers are positioned (angular position), the degree to which they are moved (amplitude) or how spread out they are (angular spread).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Tactile investigations are supplemented with underwater sniffing. This remarkable behavior consists of exhalation of air bubbles that spread onto objects and are then re-inhaled. Recordings for ultrasound both above and below water provide no evidence for echolocation or sonar, and presentation of electric fields and anatomical investigations provide no evidence for electroreception. Counts of myelinated fibers show by far the largest volume of sensory information comes from the trigeminal nerve compared to optic and cochlear nerves. This is in turn reflected in the organization of the water shrew’s neocortex, which contains two large somatosensory areas and much smaller visual and auditory areas.

The velvet bean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis) is a key soybean pest species that is well-adapted to proteinase inhibitors, particularly serine-proteinase inhibitors, which are abundant in the caterpillar host. The expression of diverse proteolytic enzymes by gut symbionts may allow the velvet bean caterpillar to circumvent proteinase inhibitors produced by the host plant. In this study, we characterized the proteolytic activity of the four nonpathogenic species of gut bacteria isolated from the velvet bean caterpillar—Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus mundtii and Staphylococcus xylosus. Two proteinase substrates, N-α-benzoyl-l-Arg-p-nitroanilide (l-BApNA) and N-α-p-tosyl-l-Arg methyl ester (l-TAME) and five proteinase inhibitors [aprotinin, E-64, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), pepstatin and N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK)] as well as CaCl2, pH and temperature profiles were used to characterize the expressed proteolytic activity of these bacterial strains in vitro. Kinetic parameters for proteolytic activity were also estimated. The results of these experiments indicated that serine- and cysteine-proteinase activities were expressed by all four gut bacteria symbionts of the velvet bean caterpillar. The cysteine- and serine-proteinase activities of these gut symbionts were distinct and different from that of gut proteinases of the caterpillar itself.

Injection of histamine caused an initial phasic hypertension which recovered, followed by a longer lasting hypertensive response accompanied by a tachycardia. Injection of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine itself caused a hypotensive tachycardia with subsequent recovery of heart rate. Ranitidine also abolished the cardiac effects of histamine injection while leaving the initial hypertensive response intact. In series, two embryos were injected with histamine after injection of diphenhydramine, the antagonist to H1 receptors.

Reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress are mostly a by-product of energy metabolism and it is therefore often assumed that oxidative stress is proportional to energy consumption. In mammals, an increased metabolic rate induced by cold exposure generally increases oxidative stress. However, compared to mammals, birds generate fewer free radicals per ATP produced and hence it is not obvious that, in birds, a cold-induced increase of metabolic rate increase oxidative stress. We tested whether cold-induced increase in metabolic rate increased oxidative stress in zebra finches by exposing individuals to cold and warm overnight temperatures. We registered metabolic rate and plasma levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs), a measure of oxidative damage. Metabolic rate was on average 88 % higher in cold compared to warm temperature, with females being stronger affected than males. However, temperature had no effect on plasma antioxidants or our measure of oxidative damage. Middle-age birds had higher levels of plasma antioxidants than younger and older birds, but age was unrelated to ROMs. Birds showed repeatability of plasma ROMs across temperatures but not of non-enzymatic antioxidants.

However, hypoxia induced a rapid and muscle-specific response concerning truncated isoforms of AMPKα. In the smooth muscle, a truncated isoform of AMPKα was increased from 1 to 6 h of hypoxia, and was linked with accumulation of AKT kinase, a key enzyme of the insulin signaling pathway which controls intracellular glucose metabolism. In this muscle, aerobic metabolism was maintained over the 6 h of hypoxia, as mitochondrial citrate synthase activity remained constant. In contrast, in striated muscle, hypoxia did not induce any significant modification of neither truncated AMPKα nor AKT protein content, and citrate synthase activity was altered after 6 h of hypoxia.

Contributing to change detection is the fact that adaptation is often stimulus specific: adaptation to a particular stimulus reduces excitability to a specific subset of stimuli, while the ability to respond to other stimuli is unaffected. Phasic cells (e.g., cells responding to stimulus onset) are good candidates for detecting the most rapid changes in natural auditory scenes, as they exhibit fast and complete adaptation to an initial stimulus presentation. We made recordings of single phasic auditory units in the frog midbrain to determine if adaptation was specific to stimulus frequency and ear of input. In response to an instantaneous frequency step in a tone, 28 % of phasic cells exhibited frequency specific adaptation based on a relative frequency change (delta-f = ±16 %). Frequency specific adaptation was not limited to frequency steps, however, as adaptation was also overcome during continuous frequency modulated stimuli and in response to spectral transients interrupting tones. The results suggest that adaptation is separated for peripheral (e.g., frequency) channels. This was tested directly using dichotic stimuli. In 45 % of binaural phasic units, adaptation was ear specific: adaptation to stimulation of one ear did not affect responses to stimulation of the other ear. Thus, adaptation exhibited specificity for stimulus frequency and lateralization at the level of the midbrain.

We have investigated the haemocyanins of two freshwater shrimps, the Amano shrimp Caridina multidentata and the bamboo shrimp Atyopsis moluccensis. We obtained three full-length and one partial cDNA sequences of haemocyanin subunits from the Amano shrimp, which were assigned to the α- and γ-types of decapod haemocyanin subunits. Three complete and two partial haemocyanin cDNA sequences were obtained from the bamboo shrimp, which represent subunit types α, β and γ. This is the first time that sequences of all three subunit types of the decapod haemocyanins were obtained from a single species. However, mass spectrometry analyses identified only α- and γ-type subunits, suggesting that a β-subunit is not a major component of the native haemocyanin of the bamboo shrimp. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses showed that malacostracan haemocyanins commenced to diversify into distinct subunit types already ~515 million years ago. β-subunits diverged first, followed by α- and γ-type subunits ~396 million years ago. The haemocyanins of phyllocarids and peracarids form distinct clades within the α/γ-cluster. Within the Caridea, an early divergence of distinct α-type subunits occurred ~200 MYA. The tree of the γ-subunits suggests a common clade of the Caridea (shrimps) and Penaeidae (prawns).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We employ signals covering the duration and frequency range of communication signals of this species (40–1,010 ms; 2, 4, 6.3 kHz), and we measure threshold level-duration (TLD) function (relating threshold level to signal duration) in silence as well as under behaviorally relevant environmental noise conditions (urban noise, woodland noise). Detection thresholds decreased with increasing signal duration. Thresholds at any given duration were a function of signal frequency and were elevated in background noise, but the shape of Great Tit TLD functions was independent of signal frequency and background condition. To enable comparisons of our Great Tit data to those from other species, TLD functions were first fitted with a traditional leaky-integrator model. We then applied a probabilistic model to interpret the trade-off between signal amplitude and duration at threshold. Great Tit TLD functions exhibit features that are similar across species. The current results, however, cannot explain why Great Tits in noisy urban environments produce shorter song elements or faster songs than those in quieter woodland environments, as detection thresholds are lower for longer elements also under noisy conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We asked whether, as in other cricket species, females were able to analyze such a high pulse rate. In phonotaxis experiments, females failed to respond to stimuli with pulse rates substantially higher or lower than the species-typical value, demonstrating that they are indeed selective for this parameter. We also examined how pulse rate was represented by modulation in firing rate of the neuron AN1, the main carrier of information about cricket-song-like stimuli to the brain. For attractive stimuli, i.e. with high pulse rates, modulation of AN1 firing rate through time was surprisingly modest. This suggests that the brain circuits that analyze AN1 spike trains might be more sensitive to slight variations in AN1 firing rate than their counterparts in more slowly singing species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The calls are complex, having two components: a frequency-modulated “whine” followed by 0–7 harmonic bursts or “chucks”. The whine is necessary and sufficient to elicit phonotaxis from females and the chuck enhances call attractiveness when it follows a whine. Although chucks are never made alone, females perceptually bind the whine and chuck when they are spatially separated. We tested whether an unintended receiver with independent evolution of phonotaxis, the frog-eating bat, Trachops cirrhosus, has converged with frogs in its auditory grouping of the call components. In contrast to frogs, bats approached chucks broadcast alone; when the chuck was spatially separated from the whine the bats preferentially approached the whine, and bats were sensitive to whine–chuck temporal sequence. This contrast suggests that although disparate taxa may be selected to respond to the same signals, different evolutionary histories, selective regimes, and neural and cognitive architectures may result in different weighting and grouping of signal components between generalist predators and conspecific mates.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we tested a novel implementation of diffusive optical imaging (also known as diffuse optical imaging, DOI) for monitoring brain physiology associated with vocal signal perception. DOI noninvasively measures brain activity using red and near-infrared light delivered through optic fibers (optodes) resting on the scalp. DOI does not harm subjects, so it raises the possibility of repeatedly measuring brain activity and the effects of accumulated experience in the same subject over an entire life span, all while leaving tissue intact for further study. We developed a custom-made apparatus for interfacing optodes to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) head using 3D modeling software and rapid prototyping technology, and applied it to record responses to presentations of birdsong in isoflurane-anesthetized zebra finches. We discovered a subtle but significant difference between the hemoglobin spectra of zebra finches and mammals which has a major impact in how hemodynamic responses are interpreted in the zebra finch. Our measured responses to birdsong playback were robust, highly repeatable, and readily observed in single trials. Responses were complex in shape and closely paralleled responses described in mammals. They were localized to the caudal medial portion of the brain, consistent with response localization from prior gene expression, electrophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.

This is consistent with the increased number of immunopositive MRCs (immunostained for NKA and ClC-3). However, the ClC-3 mRNA expression was significantly lower in FW gills.

In many cases, the ability to perform rapid movements may be crucial to fitness as doing so may allow animals to do things like effectively capture an elusive prey or to elude a chasing predator. A significant body of research has been devoted toward the musculoskeletal and neurobiological basis of animal movement, with large reviews and volumes written on locomotion and feeding. Biologists have also defined how movement can be quantified and compared among different species. Arnold (Am Zool 23:347–361, 1983) first clearly explained that the ability to perform an ecologically important task could be labeled and quantified as maximum performance abilities, a point that is elaborated upon later (Garland and Losos, Ecological morphology: integrative organismal biology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994; Irschick et al., Evol Ecol Res 10:177–196, 2008). Some commonly examined performance traits include maximum sprint speed, maximum acceleration or deceleration, maneuverability, maximum aerobic capacity (VO2max), bite force, and rapidity of tongue projection, among other examples. Although the ability to perform such movements can be limited by muscle physiology, there are several situations in which the limits of muscle physiology are circumvented with a range of specializations. Here, we synthesize the literature dealing with movement (primarily ballistic) enhancers. Our goal is both to encapsulate the current state of knowledge of enhancers, and also to provide a broader evolutionary framework that might explain in which ecological contexts they have evolved, and how they can be studied in the future. Some common mechanisms for enhancing movement include elastic energy storage (e.g., tendons and other materials) in vertebrates and invertebrates, or hormonal changes (e.g., increased testosterone levels).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Processes studied included heat shock protein expression and protein kinase activation. Molecular responses were addressed through the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases and particularly p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3). The induction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNKs and ERKs in the examined five tissues of the gilthead sea bream indicated a cellular stress response under the prism of a seasonal pattern which was characterized by distinct tissue specificity. Specifically, Hsp induction and MAPK activation occurred before peak summer water temperatures, with no further increases in their levels despite increases in water temperatures. Moreover, although water temperature did not vary significantly with depth of immersion, significant effects of depth on cellular stress response were observed, probably caused by different light regime. The expression and the activation of these certain proteins can be used as tools to define the extreme thermal limits of the gilthead sea bream.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Therefore, activities of pancreatic and intestinal enzymes processing the same substrate can be hypothesized to change together in unison, as well as to be adjusted to the concentration of their substrate in the diet. However, our knowledge of ontogenetic and diet-related changes in the digestive enzymes of birds is limited mainly to intestinal enzymes; it is largely unknown whether they are accompanied by changes in activities of enzymes produced by the pancreas. Here, we analyzed age- and diet-related changes in activities of pancreatic enzymes in five passerine and galloanserine species, and compared them with simultaneous changes in activities of intestinal enzymes. Mass-specific activity of pancreatic amylase increased with age in young house sparrows but not in zebra finches, in agreement with changes in typical dietary starch content and activity of intestinal maltase. However, we found little evidence for the presence of adaptive, diet-related modulation of pancreatic enzymes in both passerine and galloanserine species, even though in several cases the same birds adaptively modulated activities of their intestinal enzymes. In general, diet-related changes in mass-specific activities of pancreatic and intestinal enzymes were not correlated. We conclude that activity of pancreatic enzymes in birds is under strong genetic control, which enables evolutionary adjustment to typical diet composition but is less adept for short term, diet-related flexibility.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Torpor can confer substantial energy savings, but also incurs ecological costs, such as hindering allocation of energy towards reproduction. We placed temperature-sensitive radio transmitters on 44 adult Rafinesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) and deployed microclimate dataloggers inside 34 day roosts to compare the use of torpor by different sex and reproductive classes of bats during the summer. We collected 324 bat-days of skin-temperature data from 36 females and 4 males. Reproductive females employed fewer torpor bouts per day than non-reproductive females and males (P < 0.0001), and pregnant and lactating females had higher average (P < 0.0001) and minimum (P < 0.0001) skin temperatures than non-reproductive females. Pregnant females spent less time torpid (P < 0.0001) than non-reproductive females, but lactating females used relatively deep, long torpor bouts. Microclimates varied inside tree species with different configurations of entrances to the roost cavity (P < 0.0001). Bats spent more time torpid when roosting in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) trees possessing only a basal entrance to the cavity (P = 0.001). Of the tree species used as roosts, water tupelo cavities exhibited the least variable daytime and nighttime temperatures. These data demonstrate that use of summer torpor is not uniform among sex and reproductive classes in Rafinesque’s big-eared bat, and variation in microclimate among tree roosts due to species and structural characteristics facilitates the use of different thermoregulatory strategies in these bats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The decapod crustacean gut is essentially an internal tube that is divided into three functional areas, the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut houses the gastric mill apparatus which functions in mastication (cutting and grinding) of the ingested food. The processed food passes into the pyloric region of the foregut which controls movement of digesta into the midgut region and hepatopancreas where intracellular digestion takes place. The movements of the foregut muscles and gastric mill are controlled via nerves from the stomatogastric ganglion. Contraction rates of the gastric mill and foregut muscles can be influenced by environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen levels. Gut contraction rates depend on the magnitude of the environmental perturbation and the physiological ability of each species. The subsequent transit of the digesta from the foregut into the midgut and through the hindgut has been followed in a wide variety of crustaceans. Transit rates are commonly used as a measure of food processing rates and are keys in understanding strategies of adaptation to trophic conditions. Transit times vary from as little as 30 min in small copepods to over 150 h in larger lobsters. Transit times can be influenced by the size and the type of the meal, the size and activity level of an animal and changes in environmental temperature, salinity and oxygen tension. Ultimately, changes in transit times influence digestive efficiency (the amount of nutrients absorbed across the gut wall). Digestive efficiencies tend to be high for carnivorous crustaceans, but somewhat lower for those that consume plant material. A slowing of the transit rate allows more time for nutrient absorption but this may be confounded by changes in the environment, which may reduce the energy available for active transport processes. Given the large number of articles already published on the stomatogastric ganglion and its control mechanisms, this area will continue to be of interest to scientists. There is also a push towards studying animals in a more natural environment or even in the field and investigation of the energetic costs of the components of digestion under varying biotic and environmental conditions will undoubtedly be an area that expands in the future.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Because of the different sensitivities of their metabolism to temperature variation, both species were exposed to different thermal ranges. Sea bass were acclimated to 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C, and common sole to 6, 12, 18, and 24 °C, for 1 month. Isometric tension developed by ventricular strips was recorded over a range of physiological stimulation frequencies, whereas the depolarization-induced calcium transients were recorded on isolated ventricular cells through hyperpotassic solution application (at 100 mM). The SR contribution was assessed by ryanodine (RYAN) perfusion on ventricular strips and by caffeine application (at 10 mM) on isolated ventricular cells. Rates of contraction and relaxation of ventricular strip, in both species, increased with increasing acclimation temperature. At a low range of stimulation frequency, ventricular strips of common sole developed a positive force–frequency relationship at high acclimation temperature. In both the species, SR Ca2+-cycling was dependent on fish species, acclimation temperature and pacing frequency. The SR contribution was more important to force development at low acclimation temperatures in sea bass but at high acclimation temperatures in common sole. The results also revealed that high acclimation temperature causes an increase in the maximum calcium response amplitude on ventricular cells in both the species. Although sea bass and common sole occupy similar environments and tolerate similar environmental temperatures, this study indicated that sea bass and common sole can acclimatize to new thermal conditions, adjusting their cellular process in a different manner.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Sepia officinalis camouflage body patterns have been characterized spectrally in the laboratory but not in the field due to the challenges of dynamic natural light fields and the difficulty of using spectrophotometric instruments underwater. To assess cuttlefish color match in their natural habitats, we studied the spectral properties of S. officinalis and their backgrounds on the Aegean coast of Turkey using point-by-point in situ spectrometry. Fifteen spectrometry datasets were collected from seven cuttlefish; radiance spectra from animal body components and surrounding substrates were measured at depths shallower than 5 m. We quantified luminance and color contrast of cuttlefish components and background substrates in the eyes of hypothetical di- and trichromatic fish predators. Additionally, we converted radiance spectra to sRGB color space to simulate their in situ appearance to a human observer. Within the range of natural colors at our study site, cuttlefish closely matched the substrate spectra in a variety of body patterns. Theoretical calculations showed that this effect might be more pronounced at greater depths. We also showed that a non-biological method (“Spectral Angle Mapper”), commonly used for spectral shape similarity assessment in the field of remote sensing, shows moderate correlation to biological measures of color contrast. This performance is comparable to that of a traditional measure of spectral shape similarity, hue and chroma.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to summarize the parameters of torpor use in G. moholi to conclude the general patterns and discuss them in comparison to other heterotherms to elucidate possible causes and constraints that underlie these differences in deployment of heterothermy. Our study was carried out on wild animals using temperature loggers and open-flow respirometry for measurements of body temperature and metabolic rate, respectively. G. moholi uses torpor only as a last resort and not as a routine, seasonal behavior. Nevertheless, we found that the general physiological patterns of torpor, e.g., torpor bout duration or entry and arousal times from torpor, were mainly consistent with those described for other nocturnal daily heterotherms. The greatest difference found was the unusual low rewarming rates during arousal from torpor, probably due to already depleted internal energy stores and thus inability to mobilize sufficient energy for endogenous heating. We therefore conclude that while general physiological parameters of heterothermy seem to have remained conserved in heterotherms, the underlying causes which elicit this physiological response, and thus the extent of expression and timing of heterothermy, have evolved very differently in different groups, depending on body mass and the specific habitat and lifestyle of the species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study examines the effects of seasonal fluctuations in food quality and temperature on the gut morphology and the activity of sucrase, maltase, and aminopeptidase-N in the small intestinal brush-border membrane of male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Based on the adaptive modulation hypothesis and the principle of optimal gut function design, we hypothesize that the gut size, tissue-specific activity, and total hydrolytic capacity of intestinal digestive enzyme are upregulated in winter and downregulated in summer in response to diet shifts and energy demand in free-living Mongolian gerbils. Various seasonal modulation patterns in digestive enzyme activity in different regions of the small intestines were observed. The results show that male gerbils have the longest and heaviest small intestines in winter. This mechanism may be adapted to increase their food intake during winter. Male gerbils also exhibit the highest tissue-specific and total sucrase, maltase, and aminopeptidase-N activity in winter and in spring. Seasonal modulations are more distinct in the jejunum than in the duodenum and the ileum of the small intestines.

The current study compares temperature responses of the cardiac SERCA in two fish species, burbot (Lota lota) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius), which differ in regard to thermal tolerance and activity pattern. Burbot are cold stenothermal and cold-active, while crucian carp are eurythermal and cold-dormant. The fish were acclimated at 4 °C (cold-acclimation, CA) or 18 °C (warm-acclimation, WA) and expression of SERCA proteins and transcript was measured from atrium and ventricle. Burbot heart expresses one major isoform of SERCA (110 kDa), while crucian carp heart expresses two isoforms (110 and 93 kDa). Expression of SERCA proteins was about four times higher (P < 0.05) in the heart of CA burbot than WA burbot, in both cardiac chambers. In the heart of crucian carp, thermal acclimation did not affect SERCA proteins, in either chamber (P > 0.05). The expression of SERCA transcripts did not follow the expression pattern of SERCA protein in either species, suggesting that SERCA expression is mainly regulated posttranscriptionally. These findings show that the stenothermal and cold-active burbot compensates for the decrease in ambient temperature by increasing the expression of SERCA. In the eurythermal and cold-dormant crucian carp SERCA expression is independent of temperature, while the presence of two SERCA isoforms may provide some thermal independence in SR Ca2+ pumping.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The exponent is significantly higher than 0.75, so does not conform to quarter-power scaling theory, but rather is likely an emergent property with no single explanation. SMR at 1 kg body mass is similar to the literature for C. porosus and for alligators. The high exponent is not related to feeding, growth, or obesity of captive animals. The log-transformed data appear slightly curved, mainly because SMR is somewhat low in many of the largest animals (291–389 kg). A 3-parameter model is scarcely different from the linear one, but reveals a declining exponent between 0.862 and 0.798. A non-linear model on arithmetic axes overestimates SMR in 70 % of the smallest animals and does not satisfactorily represent the data.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hibernation alters dentin deposition, and a distinct hibernation mark has been described on incisor surfaces of several rodent species; the factors that influence the morphology of this mark are poorly understood. We tested the effects of day length, torpor expression, and ambient temperature on incisor surface morphology in Turkish hamsters housed in one of four conditions: long days (LDs) at 22 °C, short days (SDs) at 22 °C, SDs at 5 °C, and SDs at 13 °C. Body temperature was monitored continuously with implanted radio transmitters, and teeth examined postmortem. Teeth of SD hamsters had narrower, less distinct circadian increments than those of LD hamsters, but the width of ultradian increments was similar in both photoperiods. Hibernation at both 5 and 13 °C was associated in most specimens with very narrow, sharply defined dentin increments and increased tooth heterogeneity. Hamsters in SDs at 5 °C that did not hibernate lacked characteristic hibernation increments. At 5 °C, but not 13 °C, the number and cumulative width of hibernation increments were related to number and cumulative duration of periodic arousals.

Cats were provided with foods in different combinations (1 wet + 3 dry; 1 dry + 3 wet; 3 wet + 3 dry) in three separate experiments. Within each experiment cats were offered the wet and dry food combinations in two (naïve and experienced) diet selection phases where all the foods were offered simultaneously, separated by a phase in which the foods were offered sequentially in 3-day cycles in pairs (1 wet with 1 dry). Using nutritional geometry we demonstrate convergence upon the same dietary macronutrient composition in the naïve and experienced self-selection phases of each experiment as well as over the course of the 3-day cycles in the pair-wise choice phase of each experiment. Furthermore, even though the dietary options were very different in each of these experiments the macronutrient composition of the diets achieved across all experiments were remarkably similar. These results indicate that a mammalian obligate carnivore, the domestic cat, is able to regulate food selection and intake to balance macronutrient intake despite differences in moisture content and textural properties of the foods provided.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study evaluates the responses to salt solutions and the regulation of salt intake in white-bellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala) and New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Birds were first offered a choice of four sucrose diets, containing no salt or 25, 50 or 75 mM NaCl. The experiment was repeated using five sucrose concentrations (0.075–0.63 M) as the base solution. Both species ingested similar amounts of all diets when fed the concentrated base solutions. However, when birds had to increase their intake to obtain enough energy on the dilute sucrose diets, there was a general avoidance of the higher salt concentrations. Through this diet switching, birds maintained constant intakes of both sucrose and sodium; the latter may contribute to absorption of their sugar diets. A second, no-choice experiment was designed to elucidate the renal concentrating abilities of these two nectarivores, by feeding them 0.63 M sucrose containing 5–200 mM NaCl over a 4-h trial. In both species, cloacal fluid osmolalities increased with diet NaCl concentration, but honeyeaters tended to retain ingested Na+, while sunbirds excreted it. Comparison of Na+ and K+ concentrations in ureteral urine and cloacal fluid showed that K+, but not Na+, was reabsorbed in the lower intestine of both species. The kidneys of sunbirds and honeyeaters, like those of hummingbirds, are well suited to diluting urine; however, they also appear to concentrate urine efficiently when necessary.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Known colour preferences and requirements for flower-constant foraging bees predict different responses to colour variability. In experimental settings, we simulated small variations of unicoloured petals and variations in the spatial arrangement of colours within tricoloured petals using artificial flowers and studied their impact on the colour choices of bumblebees and honeybees. Workers were trained to artificial flowers of a given colour and then given the simultaneous choice between three test colours: either the training colour, one colour of lower and one of higher spectral purity, or the training colour, one colour of lower and one of higher dominant wavelength; in all cases the perceptual contrast between the training colour and the additional test colours was similarly small. Bees preferred artificial test flowers which resembled the training colour with the exception that they preferred test colours with higher spectral purity over trained colours. Testing the behaviour of bees at artificial flowers displaying a centripetal or centrifugal arrangement of three equally sized colours with small differences in spectral purity, bees did not prefer any type of artificial flowers, but preferentially choose the most spectrally pure area for the first antenna contact at both types of artificial flowers. Our results indicate that innate preferences for flower colours of high spectral purity in pollinators might exert selective pressure on the evolution of flower colours.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Consequently, we predicted that the latter species might have a better ability to follow the flow of freshwater or lower salinity water in the sea than the former. We investigated the freshwater discrimination ability of three sea krait species, using a Y-maze apparatus. We found that Laticauda semifasciata and Laticauda laticaudata, less terrestrial species, followed freshwater significantly more frequently than seawater, whereas Laticauda colubrina, more terrestrial species, unbiasedly selected freshwater and seawater.

We investigated their thermal and metabolic response to three weeks of 50 % food reduction at ambient temperatures of 23, 27, 32 and 35 °C by long term records of metabolic rate and body temperature in the laboratory. At all ambient temperatures, A. russatus responded to starvation by a reduction of daily energy expenditure. At 32 and 35 °C, this metabolic adjustment fully compensated the reduced food availability and they maintained their energy balance at a slightly reduced body mass. At lower ambient temperatures, they could not fully compensate for the reduced food availability and kept a negative energy balance. The reduction of daily energy expenditure was largely achieved by the occurrence of daily torpor. Torpor even occurred at high ambient temperatures of 32 and 35 °C during which metabolic depression was not associated with a marked decrease of body temperature. The results show that the occurrence of daily torpor is not necessarily linked to cold exposure and the development of a pronounced hypothermia, but may even occur as depression of metabolic rate in a hot environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Until recently, technological constraints prevented electroencephalogram (EEG) studies of animals sleeping in the wild. However, the recent development of a small recorder (Neurologger 2) that animals can carry on their head permitted the first recordings of sleep in nature. To facilitate sleep studies in the field and to improve the welfare of experimental animals, herein, we test the feasibility of using minimally invasive surface and subcutaneous electrodes to record the EEG in barn owls. The EEG and behaviour of four adult owls in captivity and of four chicks in a nest box in the field were recorded. We scored a 24-h period for each adult bird for wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep using 4 s epochs. Although the quality and stability of the EEG signals recorded via subcutaneous electrodes were higher when compared to surface electrodes, the owls’ state was readily identifiable using either electrode type. On average, the four adult owls spent 13.28 h awake, 9.64 h in SWS, and 1.05 h in REM sleep. We demonstrate that minimally invasive methods can be used to measure EEG-defined wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep in owls and probably other animals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Using passive electroreception, the animal can detect and analyze electric fields in its environment. Most electric fields in the environment are of biogenic origin, often produced by prey items. These electric fields can be relatively strong and can be a highly valuable source of information for a predator, as underlined by the fact that electroreception has evolved multiple times independently. The only mammals that possess electroreception are the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and the echidnas (Tachyglossidae) from the monotreme order, and, recently discovered, the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) from the cetacean order. Here we review the morphology, function and origin of the electroreceptors in the two aquatic species, the platypus and the Guiana dolphin. The morphology shows certain similarities, also similar to ampullary electroreceptors in fishes, that provide cues for the search for electroreceptors in more vertebrate and invertebrate species. The function of these organs appears to be very similar. Both species search for prey animals in low-visibility conditions or while digging in the substrate, and sensory thresholds are within one order of magnitude. The electroreceptors in both species are innervated by the trigeminal nerve. The origin of the accessory structures, however, is completely different; electroreceptors in the platypus have developed from skin glands, in the Guiana dolphin, from the vibrissal system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These high rates of EGP suggest extensive glucose recycling during fasting. We investigated lactate metabolism in fasting elephant seals to assess its role in glucose recycling. Whole-animal glucose and lactate fluxes were measured as the rates of appearance of glucose and lactate (Ragluc and Ralac, respectively) using a primed constant infusion of [U-14C] lactate and [6-3H] glucose, and we calculated the minimum contribution of lactate to gluconeogenesis (GNGlac). Ralac was high compared to resting values in other species (3.21 ± 0.71 mmol min−1* kg−1), did not change between 14 ± 1 and 31 ± 8 days of fasting and varied directly with Raglu. The minimum GNGlac was 44.6 ± 6.0 % of EGP, varied directly with plasma lactate levels, and did not change over the fast. Ralac and Raglu both varied directly with plasma insulin concentrations. These data suggest that lactate is the predominant gluconeogenic precursor in fasting elephant seals and that high rates of glucose recycling through Cori cycle activity contribute to the maintenance of EGP during fasting. High levels of Cori cycle activity and EGP may be important components of metabolic adaptations that maintain glucose production while avoiding ketosis during extended fasting or are related to sustained metabolic alterations associated with extended breath-holds in elephant seals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

They can use their vibrissae to detect and discriminate objects by direct touch. At least in Phocidae and Otariidae, the vibrissae can also be used to detect and analyse water movements. Here, we review what is known about this ability, known as hydrodynamic perception, in pinnipeds. Hydrodynamic perception in pinnipeds developed convergently to the hydrodynamic perception with the lateral line system in fish and the sensory hairs in crustaceans. So far two species of pinnipeds, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) representing the Phocidae and the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) representing the Otariidae, have been studied for their ability to detect local water movements (dipole stimuli) and to follow hydrodynamic trails, that is the water movements left behind by objects that have passed by at an earlier point in time. Both species are highly sensitive to dipole stimuli and can follow hydrodynamic trails accurately. In the individuals tested, California sea lions were clearly more sensitive to dipole stimuli than harbour seals, and harbour seals showed a superior trail following ability as compared to California sea lions. Harbour seals have also been shown to derive additional information from hydrodynamic trails, such as motion direction, size and shape of the object that caused the trail (California sea lions have not yet been tested). The peculiar undulated shape of the harbour seals’ vibrissae appears to play a crucial role in trail following, as it suppresses self-generated noise while the animal is swimming.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Effective object recognition requires the segregation of size and shape information. Previous studies have shown that, like in visual object recognition, bats can transfer an echo-acoustic object discrimination task to objects of different size and that they spontaneously classify scaled versions of virtual echo-acoustic objects according to trained virtual-object standards. The current study aims to bridge the gap between these previous findings using a different class of real objects and a classification—instead of a discrimination paradigm. Echolocating bats (Phyllostomus discolor) were trained to classify an object as either a sphere or an hour-glass shaped object. The bats spontaneously generalised this classification to objects of the same shape. The generalisation cannot be explained based on similarities of the power spectra or temporal structures of the echo-acoustic object images and thus require dedicated neural mechanisms dealing with size-invariant echo-acoustic object analysis. Control experiments with human listeners classifying the echo-acoustic images of the objects confirm the universal validity of auditory size invariance. The current data thus corroborate and extend previous psychophysical evidence for sonar auditory-object normalisation and suggest that the underlying auditory mechanisms following the initial neural extraction of the echo-acoustic images in echolocating bats may be very similar in bats and humans.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements revealed a temporal extension of up to 25.5 min and a spatial extension of up to 1.53 m (extrapolated) for a certain flow structure called jet 1, that is the flow produced by the tail fin. Duration and spatial extension of jet 2, the flow produced by the body, were on average lower, and both jets differed in size. The fish escaped in a mean direction approximately parallel to jet 1, and antiparallel to jet 2, with a range well above 200°. This study quantified the flow patterns generated by escaping fish and, as piscivorous predators would greatly benefit from being able to analyse these flow patterns, provides cues for the behavioural and physiological investigation of hydrodynamic sensory systems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We look initially at the recognition, by the avian immune system, of pathogen associated molecular patterns and the likely role of toll-like receptors in signaling the presence of bacteria and viruses. Several mediators of fever are subsequently released by immune cells, including interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β, that eventually reach the brain and alter thermoregulatory function. As is the case in mammals, prostaglandins appear to be the ultimate mediators of fever in birds, since the febrile response is attenuated when prostaglandin synthesis is inhibited. Ambient temperature modulates the fever response, with larger fevers at higher, and smaller fevers at lower ambient temperatures. Glucocorticoid levels are increased during fever and seem to play an important role by modulating the extent of fever generation, possibly playing a role in the attenuation of fever after repeated exposure to a pathogen in a process termed tolerance, suggesting that the fever process can be phenotypically adapted to likely future conditions. While fever has an ancient phylogenetic history and many of the underling mechanisms in birds appear similar to mammals, there are several important differences that suggest fever has evolved quite differently in these two homeothermic classes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

One prediction of the pre-existing bias hypothesis is that signal innovations that additionally excite the “untapped” organ will be more behaviorally effective than normal calls. However, recent studies have shown that females of three species with single-peaked calls that stimulate only the basilar papilla (BP) preferred single-peaked synthetic calls with a frequency typical of conspecific calls to two-peaked calls that also stimulated the amphibian papilla (AP). We report that in spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer) that also produce single-peaked calls, females did not show a preference in choices between single-peaked and two-peaked synthetic calls. Thus, the addition of energy exciting the AP had a neutral effect on signal attractiveness. Together, these results are unsupportive of the pre-existing bias hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis is that positive fitness consequences of responding to sounds providing extraordinary spectral stimulation are required for a novel call to become established as a mate-attracting signal. Testing these ideas requires a taxonomically broader examination of responses to sounds with novel spectral complexity, and attention to some methodological details will improve the comparability of such studies.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Psychophysical results,"Small songbirds have a difficult analysis problem: their head is small compared to the wavelengths of sounds used for communication providing only small interaural time and level differences. Klump and Larsen (1992) measured the physical binaural cues in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) that allow the comparison of acoustical cues and perception. We determined the starling’s minimum audible angle (MAA) in an operant Go/NoGo procedure for different spectral and temporal stimulus conditions.

The closed-loop MAA improved from 26° to 19° with an increase in pure tone frequency from 1 to 4 kHz. This finding is in line with the physical cues available.

In comparison to the killer whale and the bottlenose dolphin, the ABR of the harbour porpoise has shorter intervals between the peaks and consequently a shorter ABR duration.

The ABR to a sinusoidal amplitude modulated stimulus at 125 kHz (sensitivity threshold 63 dB re 1 μPa rms) was evaluated to determine the modulation rate transfer function of a harbour porpoise. The ABR showed distinct envelope following responses up to a modulation rate of 1,900 Hz.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the inanga α-1a and α-1b formed a clade with the α-1a and α-1b isoforms of rainbow trout, while another clade contained the α-1c isoforms of these species. The expression of all the α-1 isoforms was modulated after seawater exposure (28 ‰). In gills, the expression of the α-1a isoform was progressively down-regulated after seawater exposure, while the expression of the α-1b isoform was up-regulated. The α-1c isoform behaved similarly to the α-1a, although changes were less dramatic. Physiological indicators of salinity acclimation matched the time frame of the changes observed at the molecular level. A 24-h osmotic shock period was highlighted by small increases in plasma osmolality, plasma Na+ and a decrease in muscle tissue water content. Thereafter, these values returned close to their pre-exposure (freshwater) values. Na+, K+-ATPase activity showed a decreasing trend over the first 72 h following seawater exposure, but activity increased after 240 h.

We assayed pre-adult development time and circadian period of locomotor activity rhythm of these flies at regular intervals of 5–10 generations. After 50 generations of selection, the overall egg-to-adult duration in the selected stocks was reduced by ~29 h (~12.5 %) relative to controls, with the selected populations showing a concurrent reduction in time taken to hatching, pupation and wing pigmentation, by ~2, ~16, and ~25.2 h, respectively. Furthermore, selected populations showed a concomitant reduction in the circadian period of locomotor activity rhythm, implying that circadian clocks and development time are correlated. Thus, our study provides the first ever unequivocal evidence for the evolution of circadian clocks as a correlated response to selection for faster pre-adult development, suggesting that circadian clocks and development are linked in fruit flies D. melanogaster.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We then tested salamanders for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and the thermal sensitivities of swimming performance and standard metabolic rate. Our results indicate limited capacity for thermal acclimation to constant and variable conditions in D. brimleyorum. Instead, variation in physiological traits is dominated by differences among populations. Population differences do not appear to be correlated with observed variation in the thermal conditions of the streams, but are likely a consequence of structural and ecological differences. Due to the mixed support for theoretical predictions for acclimation to alternative environments, further consideration should be given to revising and expanding current theoretical models.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The level of echoes varies widely by tens of decibels depending on the level of the emitted sonar pulse, the target strength, the distance to the target, and the sound absorption by the water media. The auditory system of odontocetes must be capable of effective perception, analysis, and discrimination of echo-signals within all this variability. The sonar of odontocetes has several mechanisms to compensate for the echo-level variation (gain control). To date, several mechanisms of the biosonar gain control have been revealed in odontocetes: (1) adjustment of emitted sonar pulse levels (the longer the distance to the target, the higher the level of the emitted pulse), (2) short-term variation of hearing sensitivity based on forward masking of the echo by the preceding self-heard emitted pulse and subsequent release from the masking, and (3) active long-term control of hearing sensitivity. Recent investigations with the use of the auditory evoked-potential technique have demonstrated that these mechanisms effectively minimize the variation of the response to the echo when either the emitted sonar pulse level, or the target distance, or both vary within a wide range. A short review of these data is presented herein.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We extend these results to the North American Lymnaea stagnalis appressa, which is a different species from the European Lymnaea stagnalis. We describe a non-serotonergic neuron pair, PeV1, which accelerates pedal sole mucociliary transport and a serotonergic neuron pair, PeD7, which slows mucociliary transport. We compare and discuss development and identified neurons in L. s. appressa and in L. stagnalis, which have homologs to L. s. appressa PeD7 and PeV1 neurons. In addition to PeD7 and PeV1 neurons, we test neurons immunoreactive to Tritonia pedal peptide antibodies with negative results for mucociliary transport. In characterizing PeD7 and PeV1 neurons, we find that PeV1 does not excite PeD7. In semi-intact preparations, a strong increase in PeD7 neuron activity occurs during tactile stimulation, but V1 neurons are inhibited during tactile stimulation. Following tactile stimulation, PeV1 neurons show strong activity. This suggests a distinct difference in function of the two neuron pairs, which both have their axons overlying pedal sole ciliary cells. Application of 5-HT to the pedal sole initiates mucociliary transport in 1.4–1.9 s with a time course similar to that seen when stimulating a PeV1 neuron. This result appears to be through a 5-HT1A-like receptor on the pedal sole. We describe a possible external source of 5-HT on the pedal sole from 5-HT immunoreactive granules that are released with mucus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we will briefly review findings associated with these receptors that throw light on their nature, their function and their role in avian navigation. Electrophysiological recordings from the ophthalmic nerve, behavioral studies and a ZENK-study indicate that the trigeminal system, the nerves innervating the beak, mediate information on magnetic changes, with the electrophysiological study suggesting that these are changes in intensity. Behavioral studies support the involvement of magnetite and the trigeminal system in magnetoreception, but clearly show that the inclination compass normally used by birds represents a separate system. However, if this compass is disrupted by certain light conditions, migrating birds show ‘fixed direction’ responses to the magnetic field, which originate in the receptors in the beak. Together, these findings point out that there are magnetite-based magnetoreceptors located in the upper beak close to the skin. Their natural function appears to be recording magnetic intensity and thus providing one component of the multi-factorial ‘navigational map’ of birds.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In crustaceans, this is achieved by regularly stacking photopigment-rich microvilli in alternating orthogonal bands within fused rhabdoms. Despite being critical for the efficient detection of polarised light, very little research has focused on the detailed arrangement of these microvilli bands. We report here a number of hitherto undescribed, but functionally relevant changes in the organisation of microvilli banding patterns, both within receptors, and across the compound eye of fiddler crabs. In all ommatidia, microvilli bands increase in length from the distal to the proximal ends of the rhabdom. In equatorial rhabdoms, horizontal bands increase gradually from 3 rows of microvilli distally to 20 rows proximally. In contrast, vertical equatorial microvilli bands contain 15–20 rows of microvilli in the distal 30 µm of the rhabdom, shortening to 10 rows over the next 30 µm and then increase in length to 20 rows in parallel with horizontal bands. In the dorsal eye, horizontal microvilli occupy only half the cross-sectional area as vertical microvilli bands. Modelling absorption along the length of fiddler crab rhabdoms suggests that (1) increasing band length assures that photon absorption probability per band remains constant along the length of photoreceptors, indicating that individual bands may act as units of transduction or adaptation; (2) the different organisation of microvilli bands in equatorial and dorsal rhabdoms tune receptors to the degree and the information content of polarised light in the environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In a neuron with a contralaterally descending axon, the male calling song elicited responses that copied the pulse pattern of the song during standing and walking. The accuracy of pulse copying increased during walking. Neurons with ipsilaterally descending axons responded weakly to sound only during standing. The responses were mainly to the first pulse of each chirp, whereas the complete pulse pattern of a chirp was not copied. During walking the auditory responses were suppressed in these neurons. The spiking activity of all four neuron types was significantly correlated to forward walking velocity, indicating their relevance for walking. Additionally, injection of depolarizing current elicited walking and/or steering in three of four neuron types described. In none of the neurons was the spiking activity both sufficient and necessary to elicit and maintain walking behaviour. Some neurons showed arborisations in the lateral accessory lobes, pointing to the relevance of this brain region for cricket audition and descending motor control.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Vocal tract movements consist of beak, tongue and hyoid movements, which change the volume of the oropharyngeal–esophageal cavity (OEC), glottal movements and tracheal length changes. The respective contributions of each movement to filter properties are not completely understood, but the effects of this filtering are thought to be very important for acoustic communication in birds. One of the most striking movements of the upper vocal tract during vocal behavior in songbirds involves the OEC. This study measured the acoustic effect of OEC adjustments in zebra finches by comparing resonance acoustics between an utterance with OEC expansion (calls) and a similar utterance without OEC expansion (respiratory sounds induced by a bilateral syringeal denervation). X-ray cineradiography confirmed the presence of an OEC motor pattern during song and call production, and a custom-built Hall-effect collar system confirmed that OEC expansion movements were not present during respiratory sounds. The spectral emphasis during zebra finch call production ranging between 2.5 and 5 kHz was not present during respiratory sounds, indicating strongly that it can be attributed to the OEC expansion.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

When controlling for trial temperature and body mass, velvet worms from the drier and warmer site had significantly lower water loss rates than the wetter and cooler site. Mass-corrected metabolic rate and cuticular water loss did not differ significantly between the two sites. The scaling exponent for the relationship between log metabolic rate and log body mass for O. cinctipes s.l. declined with an increase in temperature from 5 to 15 °C.

Previous studies have described D. simulans as a desiccation sensitive species which is inconsistent with its occurrence in temperate regions. We tested the hypothesis whether developmental plasticity of cuticular traits confers adaptive changes in water balance-related traits in the sibling species D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results are interesting in several respects. First, D. simulans grown at 15 °C possesses a high level of desiccation resistance in larvae (~39 h) and in adults (~86 h) whereas the corresponding values are quite low at 25 °C (larvae ~7 h; adults ~13 h). Interestingly, cuticular lipid mass was threefold higher in D. simulans grown at 15 °C as compared with 25 °C while there was no change in cuticular lipid mass in D. melanogaster. Second, developmental plasticity of body melanisation was evident in both species. Drosophila simulans showed higher melanisation at 15 °C as compared with D. melanogaster while the reverse trend was observed at 25 °C. Third, changes in water balance-related traits (bulk water, hemolymph and dehydration tolerance) showed superiority of D. simulans at 15 °C but of D. melanogaster at 25 °C growth temperature. Rate of carbohydrate utilization under desiccation stress did not differ at 15 °C in both the species. Fourth, effects of developmental plasticity on cuticular traits correspond with changes in the cuticular water loss i.e. water loss rates were higher at 25 °C as compared with 15 °C. Thus, D. simulans grown under cooler temperature was more desiccation tolerant than D. melanogaster. Finally, desiccation acclimation capacity of larvae and adults is higher for D. simulans reared at 15 °C but quite low at 25 °C. Thus, D. simulans and D. melanogaster have evolved different strategies of water conservation consistent with their adaptations to dry and wet habitats in the western Himalayas. Our results suggest that D. simulans from lowland localities seems vulnerable due to limited acclimation potential in the context of global climatic change in the western Himalayas. Finally, this is the first report on higher desiccation resistance of D. simulans due to developmental plasticity of both the cuticular traits (body melanisation and epicuticular lipid mass) when grown at 15 °C, which is consistent with its abundance in temperate regions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

They can discriminate landscape scenes, types of flowers, and even human faces. This suggests that in spite of their small brain, honeybees have a highly developed capacity for processing complex visual information, comparable in many respects to vertebrates. Here, we investigated whether this capacity extends to complex images that humans distinguish on the basis of artistic style: Impressionist paintings by Monet and Cubist paintings by Picasso. We show that honeybees learned to simultaneously discriminate between five different Monet and Picasso paintings, and that they do not rely on luminance, colour, or spatial frequency information for discrimination. When presented with novel paintings of the same style, the bees even demonstrated some ability to generalize. This suggests that honeybees are able to discriminate Monet paintings from Picasso ones by extracting and learning the characteristic visual information inherent in each painting style. Our study further suggests that discrimination of artistic styles is not a higher cognitive function that is unique to humans, but simply due to the capacity of animals—from insects to humans—to extract and categorize the visual characteristics of complex images.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This guarantees that they will not return to the dung pile, where they risk having their ball stolen by other beetles. Dung beetles are known to use celestial compass cues such as the sun, the moon and the pattern of polarised light formed around these light sources to roll their balls of dung along straight paths. Here, we investigate whether terrestrial landmarks have any influence on straight-line orientation in dung beetles. We find that the removal or re-arrangement of landmarks has no effect on the beetle’s orientation precision. Celestial compass cues dominate straight-line orientation in dung beetles so strongly that, under heavily overcast conditions or when prevented from seeing the sky, the beetles can no longer orient along straight paths. To our knowledge, this is the only animal with a visual compass system that ignores the extra orientation precision that landmarks can offer.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We hypothesised that an ability to detect and use polarised light could be valuable for seals, and thus tested if they are able to see this property of light. We performed two behavioural experiments, one involving object discrimination and the other involving object detection. These objects were presented to the seals as two-dimensional stimuli on a specially modified liquid crystal display that generated objects whose contrast was purely defined in terms of polarisation (i.e. objects lacked luminance contrast). In both experiments, the seals’ performance did not deviate significantly from chance. In contrast, the seals showed a high baseline performance when presented with objects on a non-modified display (whose contrast was purely defined in terms of luminance). We conclude that harbour seals are unable to use polarised light in our experimental context.

Call recognition by green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) in temporally fluctuating noise,"Despite the importance of perceptually separating signals from background noise, we still know little about how nonhuman animals solve this problem. Dip listening, an ability to catch meaningful ‘acoustic glimpses’ of a target signal when fluctuating background noise levels momentarily drop, constitutes one possible solution. Amplitude-modulated noises, however, can sometimes impair signal recognition through a process known as modulation masking. We asked whether fluctuating noise simulating a breeding chorus affects the ability of female green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) to recognize male advertisement calls. Our analysis of recordings of the sounds of green treefrog choruses reveal that their levels fluctuate primarily at rates below 10 Hz. In laboratory phonotaxis tests, we found no evidence for dip listening or modulation masking. Mean signal recognition thresholds in the presence of fluctuating chorus-like noises were never statistically different from those in the presence of a non-fluctuating control. An analysis of statistical effects sizes indicates that masker fluctuation rates, and the presence versus absence of fluctuations, had negligible effects on subject behavior. Together, our results suggest that females listening in natural settings should receive no benefits, nor experience any additional constraints, as a result of level fluctuations in the soundscape of green treefrog choruses.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, renesting is quite common among seabirds and can contribute considerably to individual fitness. Prolactin and corticosterone are two hormones involved in the mediation of breeding behavior and, as they are linked to body condition or effort, it is of interest if these hormone values change during a second demanding breeding phase within a year. We compared baseline prolactin and corticosterone between the first and the renesting attempt in common terns (Sterna hirundo) on individual level. Therefore, in addition to control birds, 37 breeders were sampled during incubation of their first and their replacement clutch in 2008 and 2009. Blood samples were taken non-invasively by blood-sucking bugs. Prolactin level was lower during the renesting period, especially in birds which abandoned their clutch afterwards, whereas corticosterone did not change. Excluding the deserting birds, the reduced prolactin level was not linked to minor success, but could be related to seasonal processes. The control group of late laying common terns showed comparably low prolactin values, but increased corticosterone concentrations. Renesting individuals exhibited higher prolactin during incubation of their first clutch than non-renesting birds, probably indicating their higher quality. The fact that terns still have relatively high prolactin and low corticosterone values during renesting might confirm their higher quality and suggests that they are able to meet the costs of a second demanding breeding period without being considerably stressed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Histological and behavioral evidence suggests that neurons are present in ALs and the AL acts as a sensory organ of equilibrium during walking. Neurons in the outer layer of the AL consistently show glutamate-like immunoreactivity and neurons in the central region of the AL show glutamate receptor-like immunoreactivity. However, it is unknown how glutamate acts on the functional activity of AL neurons. In this study, we examined the effects of glutamate on the electrical activities of AL neurons using the patch clamp technique. There are two types of neurons among isolated AL neurons: spontaneously firing and silent neurons. Among silent neurons, 42 % of neurons responded to glutamate and generated repetitive firing. Kainate and glutamate in combination with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, also induced firing and evoked an inward current. On the other hand, the application of AMPA, NMDA or glutamate in combination with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, CNQX, did not. These results indicate that chick AL neurons express functional kainate receptors to respond to glutamate and suggest that the glutamatergic transmission plays a role in excitatory regulation of AL neurons of the chick.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Diet 1 was enriched in 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 while Diet 2 was enriched in 22:6n-3. The FA composition of mitochondrial phospholipids was strongly affected by diet. 22:6n-3 levels were twice as high (49 %) in mitochondrial phospholipids of fish fed Diet 2 than in those fed Diet 1. 18:2n-6 content of the phospholipids also followed the diets, whereas 18:1n-9 changed little. All n-6 FA, most notably 22:5n-6, were significantly higher in fish fed Diet 1. Nonetheless, total saturated FA, total monounsaturated FA and total polyunsaturated FA in mitochondrial phospholipids varied little. Despite a marked impact of diet on specific FA levels in mitochondrial phospholipids, only non-phosphorylating (state 4) rates were higher in fish fed Diet 2. Phosphorylating rates (state 3), oxygen consumption due to flux through the electron transport chain complexes as well as the corresponding spectrophotometric activities did not differ with diet. Body mass affected state 4 rates and cytochrome c oxidase and F0F1 ATPase activities while complex I showed a diet-specific effect of body mass. Only the minor FA that were affected by body mass were correlated with functional properties. The regulated incorporation of dietary FA into phospholipids seems to allow fish to maintain critical membrane functions even when the lipid quality of their diets varies considerably, as is likely in their natural environment.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although the shapes of branches and the voids in arboreal habitats seem likely to affect searching behaviors, their influence is poorly understood. To gain insights into how both environmental structure and the attributes of an animal may affect movement and searching, we compared the three-dimensional exploratory movements of snakes in the dark on two simulated arboreal surfaces (disc and horizontal cylinder). Most of the exploratory movements of snakes in the dark were a small fraction of the distances they could reach while bridging gaps in the light. The snakes extended farther away from the edge of the supporting surface at the ends of the cylinder than from the sides of the cylinder or from any direction from the surface of the disc. The exploratory movements were not random, and the surface shape and three-dimensional directions had significant interactive effects on how the movements were structured in time. Thus, the physical capacity for reaching did not limit the area that was explored, but the shape of the supporting surface and the orientation relative to gravity did create biased searching patterns.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The nitrogen content of diet was tightly correlated with the fraction of gut contents represented by insects relative to plant material. The carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of diet, liver, and muscle were all linearly correlated, implying high temporal consistency in the isotopic value of the diet of these birds. However, δ15N was not significantly related with the percentage of insects in diet. These results cast doubt on the applicability of the use of 15N enrichment to diagnose trophic level in, at least some, terrestrial ecosystems. However, the residuals of the relationship relating the isotopic value of bird tissues with those of their diet were weakly negatively correlated with insect intake. We hypothesize that this negative correlation stems from the higher quality of protein found in insects relative to that of plant materials.

After 3 days of treatment with all immuno-stimulants, decreased numbers and changed composition of the coelomocytes were observed. The immuno-stimulants also induced numerous changes in bactericidal activity, including ROS production.

The results demonstrate that the fur seals as a group were able to discriminate between the optical isomers of carvone, dihydrocarvone, dihydrocarveol, menthol, limonene oxide, α-pinene, fenchone (all p < 0.01), and β-citronellol (p < 0.05), whereas they failed to distinguish between the (+)- and (−)-forms of limonene, isopulegol, rose oxide, and camphor (all p > 0.05). An analysis of odor structure–activity relationships suggests that a combination of molecular structural properties rather than a single molecular feature may be responsible for the discriminability of enantiomeric odor pairs. A comparison between the discrimination performance of the fur seals and that of other species tested previously on the same set of enantiomers (or subsets thereof) suggests that the olfactory discrimination capabilities of this marine mammal are surprisingly well developed and not generally inferior to that of terrestrial mammals such as human subjects and non-human primates. Further, comparisons suggest that neither the relative nor the absolute size of the olfactory bulbs appear to be reliable predictors of between-species differences in olfactory discrimination capabilities. Taken together, the results of the present study support the notion that the sense of smell may play an important and hitherto underestimated role in regulating the behavior of fur seals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

These fish have biochemical and molecular features that allow them to live at these extreme cold temperatures. Fine tuning of the level of unsaturated fatty acids content in membrane is a key mechanism of living organisms to adapt to cold and high temperatures. Desaturases are key enzymes that synthesize unsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs from saturated fatty acids. We cloned and sequenced a Δ9-desaturase gene and its cDNA of C. hamatus, and the cDNA of T. bernacchii. The coded proteins are virtually identical and share homology to other Δ9-desaturase fish sequences. These proteins contain, in the first trans-membrane domain, two cysteine residues that may form a disulfur bond present in the corresponding membrane region of Δ9-desaturase proteins of other Antarctic fish but not in Eleginops maclovinus that experiences higher environmental temperatures and in all other Δ9-desaturase genes of mammals present in data bases. C. hamatus Δ9-desaturase gene complements a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking Δ9-desaturase (Ole1) gene. Analysis of sequence homology of the trans-membrane domains of Δ9-desaturase and the cytoplasmic region of the same proteins of Antarctic fish, non-Antarctic fish and mammals suggest that the significant differences found in the homologous sequences of the first trans-membrane domain may be due to the specific lipid content of their membrane.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

BMR is one of the most widely measured physiological traits, and data are available for over 1,200 species. With data available for such a wide range of species, BMR is a benchmark measurement in ecological and evolutionary physiology, and is often used as a reference against which other levels of metabolism are compared. Implicit in such comparisons is the assumption that BMR is invariant for a given species and that it therefore represents a stable point of comparison. However, BMR shows substantial variation between individuals, populations and species. Investigation of the ultimate (evolutionary) explanations for these differences remains an active area of inquiry, and explanation of size-related trends remains a contentious area. Whereas explanations for the scaling of BMR are generally mechanistic and claim ties to the first principles of chemistry and physics, investigations of mass-independent variation typically take an evolutionary perspective and have demonstrated that BMR is ultimately linked with a range of extrinsic variables including diet, habitat temperature, and net primary productivity. Here we review explanations for size-related and mass-independent variation in the BMR of animals, and suggest ways that the various explanations can be evaluated and integrated.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We focused on feed intake, nutrient uptake, nutrient utilization, and endocrine regulation through growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factors (IGF), and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP). During prolonged thermal exposure, salmon reduced feed intake and growth. Feed utilization was reduced at 19 °C after 45 days compared with fish at lower temperatures, and body lipid storage was depleted with increasing water temperature. Although plasma IGF-1 concentrations did not change, 32-Da and 43-kDa IGFBP increased in fish reared at ≤17 °C, and dropped in fish reared at 19 °C. Muscle igf1 mRNA levels were reduced at 15 and 45 days in fish reared at 15, 17, and 19 °C. Muscle igf2 mRNA levels did not change after 15 days in response to increasing temperature, but were reduced after 45 days. Although liver igf2 mRNA levels were reduced with increasing temperatures after 15 and 45 days, temperature had no effect on igf1 mRNA levels. The liver igfbp2b mRNA level, which corresponds to circulating 43-kDa IGFBP, exhibited similar responses after 45 days. IGFBP of 23 kDa was only detected in plasma in fish reared at 17 °C, and up-regulation of the corresponding igfbp1b gene indicated a time-dependent catabolic response, which was not observed in fish reared at 19 °C. However, higher muscle ghr mRNA levels were detected in fish at 17 and 19 °C than in fish at lower temperatures, indicating lipolytic regulation in muscle. These results show that the reduction of muscle growth in large salmon is mediated by decreased igf1 and igf2 mRNA levels in addition to GH-associated lipolytic action to cope with prolonged thermal exposure. Accordingly, 13 °C appears to be a more optimal temperature for the growth of adult Atlantic salmon at sea.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, we aimed to define encephalopsin protein abundance and localization in the rodent brain. The distribution and localization of encephalopsin protein in a mouse brain and selected peripheral tissues were analysed in ten mice, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The specificity of immunoreaction was validated by primary antibody omitting and immunizing peptide blocking experiment. We found encephalopsin protein abundant in the mouse brain, but not in the periphery. Encephalopsin protein was present in neurons of the mouse cerebral cortex, paraventricular area, and cerebellar cells. Our results show that encephalopsin is expressed at the protein level in different brain areas of the mouse.

Many spinal interneurons are multifunctional, contributing to multiple limb movements, but others are specialized. It is unclear whether anatomical distributions of activated neurons differ for different limb movements. We examined distributions of activated neurons for locomotion and scratching using an activity-dependent dye. Adult turtles were stimulated to generate repeatedly forward swimming, rostral scratching, pocket scratching, or caudal scratching motor patterns, while sulforhodamine 101 was applied to the spinal cord. Sulforhodamine-labeled neurons were widely distributed rostrocaudally, dorsoventrally, and mediolaterally after each motor pattern, concentrated bilaterally in the deep dorsal horn, the lateral intermediate zone, and the dorsal to middle ventral horn. Labeled neurons were common in all hindlimb enlargement segments and the pre-enlargement segment following swimming and scratching, but a significantly higher percentage were in the rostral segments following swimming than rostral scratching. These findings suggest that largely the same spinal regions are activated during swimming and scratching, but there are some differences that may indicate locations of behaviorally specialized neurons. Finally, the substantial inter-animal variability following a single kind of motor pattern may indicate that essentially the same motor output is generated by anatomically variable networks.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This study employed continuous telemetric monitoring of body temperature (Tb) in hibernating male and female Turkish hamsters at ambient temperatures (Tas) of 5 and 13 °C to precisely characterize torpor bout depth, duration, and frequency, as well as rates of entry into and arousal from torpor. Hamsters generated brief intervals of short (<12 h), shallow test bouts (Tb > 20 °C), followed by deep torpor bouts lasting 4–6 days at Ta = 5 °C and 2–3 days at Ta = 13 °C. Females at Ta = 5 °C had longer bouts than males, but maintained higher torpor Tb; there were no sex differences at Ta = 13 °C. Neither body mass loss nor food intake differed between the two Tas. Hamsters entered torpor primarily during the scotophase (subjective night), but timing of arousals was highly variable.

How well do the results from these studies reflect the natural behaviour of flying insects considering the radical differences in contrast, spatial composition, colour and dimensionality between these visual environments? Here, we aim to answer this question by investigating the effect of three- and two-dimensional naturalistic and artificial scenes on bumblebee flight control in an outdoor setting and compare the results with those of similar experiments performed in an indoor setting. In particular, we focus on investigating the effect of axial (front-to-back) visual motion cues on ground speed and centring behaviour. Our results suggest that, in general, ground speed control and centring behaviour in bumblebees is not affected by whether the visual scene is two- or three dimensional, naturalistic or artificial, or whether the experiment is conducted indoors or outdoors. The only effect that we observe between naturalistic and artificial scenes on flight control is that when the visual scene is three-dimensional and the visual information on the floor is minimised, bumblebees fly further from the midline of the tunnel. The findings presented here have implications not only for understanding the mechanisms of visual flight control in bumblebees, but also for the results of past and future investigations into visually guided flight control in other insects.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Corneas of vertebrate simple camera-type eyes possess microprojections on the outer surface in the form of microridges, microvilli, and microplicae. Corneas of invertebrates, which have simple or compound eyes, or both, may be featureless or may possess microprojections in the form of nipples. It was previously unknown whether cephalopods (invertebrates with camera-type eyes like vertebrates) possess corneal microprojections and, if so, of what form. Using scanning electron microscopy, we examined corneas of a range of cephalopods and discovered nipple-like microprojections in all species. In some species, nipples were like those described on arthropod compound eyes, with a regular hexagonal arrangement and sizes ranging from 75 to 103 nm in diameter. In others, nipples were nodule shaped and irregularly distributed. Although terrestrial invertebrate nipples create an antireflective surface that may play a role in camouflage, no such optical function can be assigned to cephalopod nipples due to refractive index similarities of corneas and water.

In this study, we measured the expression of 11 metabolic genes in response to thermal and dehydration stress. During both heat and cold stress, we observed upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) and glycogen phosphorylase (gp) to support rapid glucose mobilization. In contrast, there was a general downregulation of pathways related to polyol, trehalose, and proline synthesis during both high- and low-temperature stress. Pepck was likewise upregulated in response to different types of dehydration stress; however, for many of the other genes, expression patterns depended on the nature of dehydration stress. Following fast dehydration, expression patterns were similar to those observed during thermal stress, i.e., upregulation of gp accompanied by downregulation of trehalose and proline synthetic genes. In contrast, gradual, prolonged dehydration (both at a constant temperature and in conjunction with chilling) promoted marked upregulation of genes responsible for trehalose and proline synthesis. On the whole, our data agree with known metabolic adaptations to stress in B. antarctica, although a few discrepancies between gene expression patterns and downstream metabolite contents point to fluxes that are not controlled at the level of transcription.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Therefore, during the reproductive period females could potentially adjust patterns of thermoregulation and foraging in concert to minimise the energetic constraints associated with pregnancy and lactation. We assessed the influence of pregnancy, lactation, and post-lactation on torpor use and foraging behaviour by female little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus. We measured thermoregulation by recording skin temperature and foraging by tracking bats which carried temperature-sensitive radio-tags. We found that individuals, regardless of reproductive condition, used torpor, but the patterns of torpor use varied significantly between reproductive (pregnant and lactating) females and post-lactating females. As we predicted, reproductive females entered torpor for shorter bouts than post-lactating females. Although all females used torpor frequently, pregnant females spent less time in torpor, and maintained higher skin temperatures than either lactating or post-lactating females. This result suggests that delayed offspring development which has been associated with torpor use during pregnancy, may pose a higher risk to an individual’s reproductive success than reduced milk production during lactation. Conversely, foraging behaviour of radio-tagged bats did not vary with reproductive condition, suggesting that even short, shallow bouts of torpor produce substantial energy savings, likely obviating the need to spend more time foraging. Our data clearly show that torpor use and reproduction are not mutually exclusive and that torpor use (no matter how short or shallow) is an important means of balancing the costs of reproduction for M. lucifugus.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Males and females have the same visual pigment expression patterns, but the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities are sexually dimorphic. The photoreceptors coexpressing three middle wavelength-absorbing opsins are broad-blue receptors in males, but in females they are narrow-blue receptors. Those with CeV1 and CeV2 are violet receptors in females, while they are shouldered-blue receptors in males.

In the present study, the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NPY and GABA receptor antagonists on food intake was examined in neonatal chicks. The ICV injection of NPY strongly stimulated food intake while co-administration of NPY and picrotoxin, a GABAA antagonist, (but not CGP54626, a GABAB antagonist) weakened food intake induced by NPY.

However, few studies have determined the identity or source of chemical compounds signaling amphibian defensive behaviors, in particular, whether alarm pheromones can be actively secreted from tadpoles signaling danger to conspecifics. Here we exposed tadpoles of the common toad Bufo bufo and common frog Rana temporaria to known cues signaling predation risk and to potential alarm pheromones. In both species, an immediate reduction in swimming activity extending over an hour was caused by chemical cues from the predator Aeshna cyanea (dragonfly larvae) that had been feeding on conspecific tadpoles. However, B. bufo tadpoles did not detectably alter their behavior upon exposure to potential alarm pheromones, neither to their own skin secretions, nor to the abundant predator-defense peptide bradykinin. Thus, chemicals signaling active predation had a stronger effect than general alarm secretions of other common toad tadpoles. This species may invest in a defensive strategy alternative to communication by alarm pheromones, given that Bufonidae are toxic to some predators and not known to produce defensive skin peptides.

In tests with a continuous series of pulses at different modulation frequencies, the transfer function of pattern discrimination was also determined. Females exhibited two ranges of high response scores indicating two temporal filters with an inhibitory interaction.

Colonies with a normal age structure were used to collect bees of different ages, as well as pollen foragers of unknown age. Single- and double-cohort colonies were established also to generate nurses and pollen foragers of the same age. Amdop1 was the only gene examined that showed no significant change in expression levels across the age groups tested.

This implies higher nutrient turnover with exercise. Higher retention of dietary protein (higher 15N uptake into white muscle during the entire post-prandial period) was found under sustained exercise, highlighting the protein-sparing effect. The combined effects of a carbohydrate-rich, low-protein diet plus sustained swimming enhanced amino acid retention and also prevented excessive lipid deposition in gilthead sea bream.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A special focus was laid on possible correlations between morphological and song traits of males that could be used by females to infer quality cues of potential mates. We also tested whether females exhibit preferences for males of their own population. Specific song features (onset accentuation, offset, syllable period) of males—but not of females—differed between populations. We observed size differences both in males and females from different populations, but the size ranks of the two sexes were not always correlated. Environmental factors appear to have a strong influence on different size traits, compared to genetic origin. In all populations a specific song feature, the accentuation of syllable onsets, showed a similar correlation with a morphological trait, hind leg size, but its correlation with other size indicators sometimes differed in sign. Females did not prefer songs of males from their own population. The best predictor for song attractiveness was—unexpectedly—not the onset accentuation but the offset depth.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

There were significant effects of species, temperature, and relative humidity on SMR. SMR was lower for A. raphiduca than both A. ‘Tropicana’ spp. with no difference between the two A. ‘Tropicana’ spp. Metabolic rate increased at higher temperature and relative humidity for all three species. There were significant effects of species, temperature, and relative humidity on EWL. The mesic Aganippe species had a significantly higher EWL than either arid Tropicana species. EWL was significantly higher at lower relative humidity. Our results suggest an environmental effect on EWL but not SMR, and that mygalomorphs are so vulnerable to desiccation that the burrow provides a crucial refuge to ameliorate the effects of low environmental humidity.

Due to the increased travelling distance involved when an air-breathing fish swims to and from the surface, and the increased drag when the surface is breached, it can be proposed that air-breathing results in a rise in the apparent cost of transport. In order to investigate this hypothesis, it is necessary to use a fish that is able to swim equally well with and without access to air. The striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus has been shown to have a sufficiently high capacity for aquatic oxygen uptake in normoxia, to allow for such a comparison. Here, we measured the partitioning of oxygen uptake ($$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$) during swimming and recovery, and calculated the apparent cost of transport with and without access to air, under normoxic conditions. Aerial $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ constituted 25–40 % of the total $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{2} $$ during swimming and less than 15 % during recovery. The net cost of transport was 25 % lower in fish that did not air-breathe compared to fish that did, showing that the cost of surfacing can be substantial. This is the first study to measure partitioning in an air-breathing fish during swimming at velocities close to the critical swimming speed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The relationship between Ucrit and temperature (T) approximately followed a bell-shaped curve as temperature increased: Ucrit = 8.21/{1 + [(T − 27.2)/17.0]2} (R2 = 0.915, P < 0.001, N = 40). The optimal temperature for maximal Ucrit (8.21 BL s−1) in juvenile qingbo was 27.2 °C.

The capacity for paracellular absorption seems greater in fliers than in nonfliers, although that conclusion rests mainly on a comparison of flying birds and nonflying mammals because only two frugivorous bat species have been studied. Furthermore, the bats studied so far were relatively large (>85 g, compared with most bat species which are <20 g) and were not insectivores (like about 70 % of bat species). We studied the small (11 g) insectivorous bat Tadarida brasiliensis and tested the prediction that the capacity for paracellular absorption would be as high as in the other bat and avian species studied so far, well above that in terrestrial, nonflying mammals. Using standard pharmacokinetic technique, we measured the extent of absorption (fractional absorption = f) of inert carbohydrate probes: L-arabinose (MM = 150.13) absorbed exclusively by paracellular route and 3OMD-glucose (MM = 194) absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly. As predicted, the capacity of paracellular absorption in this insectivorous bat was high (L-arabinose f = 1.03 ± 0.14) as in other frugivorous bats and small birds. Absorption of 3OMD-glucose was also complete (f = 1.09 ± 0.17), but >80 % was accounted for by paracellular absorption.

In this study, zebrafish were experimentally acclimated for 28 days to 18, 26 or 34 °C and a suite of non-invasive and invasive methods was applied to determine the thermal dependence of zebrafish physiological condition. With decreasing temperature, the metabolic rate of zebrafish decreased, as shown by the decreasing oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion rates, limiting the critical swimming speed, probably due to a decreased muscle fibre power output. In response to exercise, fuel stores were mobilized to the liver as shown by the increased hepatosomatic index, liver total absolute energetic value and liver carbohydrate concentration but due to the low metabolic rate they could not be adequately addressed to power swimming activity at 18 °C. Conversely, the increased metabolic performance at high temperature came with an increased metabolic cost resulting in decreased energy status reflected particularly well by the non-invasive condition factor and invasive measures of carcass protein concentration, carcass total absolute energetic value and liver carbohydrate concentration. We showed that the combined measurement of the relative condition factor and critical swimming speed is a powerful non-invasive tool for long-term follow-up studies. Invasive methods were redundant for measuring general energy status but they provided detailed information concerning metabolic reorganization. With this study we proved that the usefulness of the zebrafish as a model organism can easily be expanded to include physiological studies and we provided a reference dataset for the selection of measures of physiological responses for future studies using the zebrafish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

While most studies examining BMR have concentrated on inter-specific variation, relatively less attention has been paid to the determinants of within-species variation. Even fewer studies have analysed the determinants of within-species BMR variation corrected for the strong influence of body mass by appropriate means (e.g. ANCOVA). Here, we review recent advancements in studies on the quantitative genetics of BMR and organ mass variation, along with their molecular genetics. Next, we decompose BMR variation at the organ, tissue and molecular level. We conclude that within-species variation in BMR and its components have a clear genetic signature, and are functionally linked to key metabolic process at all levels of biological organization. We highlight the need to integrate molecular genetics with conventional metabolic field studies to reveal the adaptive significance of metabolic variation. Since comparing gene expressions inter-specifically is problematic, within-species studies are more likely to inform us about the genetic underpinnings of BMR. We also urge for better integration of animal and medical research on BMR; the latter is quickly advancing thanks to the application of imaging technologies and ‘omics’ studies. We also suggest that much insight on the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of BMR variation can be gained from integrating studies on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which appears to be the major regulatory pathway influencing the key molecular components of BMR.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, distribution of blubber FAs is not necessarily uniform along the body. It is therefore important to understand the deposition of dietary fat to be able to estimate the diet. We analysed the FA compositions of the thoracic ventral (T region) blubber of 28 New Zealand (NZ) sea lions Phocarctos hookeri by-caught by the southern arrow squid Nototodarus sloani fishery. Each blubber sample was divided into an inner and an outer layer. For 16 of these 28 animals, the pelvic dorsal (P) region was also sampled. The influence of body region and layer was statistically tested on the distribution of blubber FAs. We found minimal differences between the P and T regions (3 out of 29 FAs). The outer blubber layer was more concentrated in short-chain monounsaturated FAs, and less concentrated in saturated FAs, but the degree of stratification was small. Diet predictions from quantitative FA signature analysis (QFASA) applied on different body regions were similar. When applied to different blubber layers, QFASA gave some variation in the contribution of rattails (~25 % in outer blubber vs. ~12 % in inner blubber). Nonetheless, diet predicted from both layers was dominated by similar prey species: octopus, hoki and rattails. Hoki and rattails shared a similar ecological niche. Therefore, feeding ecology of NZ sea lions inferred from the inner or the outer blubber would lead to the same conclusions. In the case of NZ sea lions, the outer layer of blubber, if the only sample accessible, could be a useful tissue for diet inference from FAs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that confer protection to birds against excessive ROS generation. Hence, we investigated the ability of birds to control mitochondrial ROS generation during physiologically stressful periods. In our study, we analyzed the relationship between the thyroid status and the function of intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria located in glycolytic and oxidative muscles of ducklings. We found that the intermyofibrillar mitochondria of both glycolytic and oxidative muscles down regulate ROS production when plasma T3 levels rise. The intermyofibrillar mitochondria of the gastrocnemius muscle (an oxidative muscle) produced less ROS and were more sensitive than the pectoralis muscle (a glycolytic muscle) to changes in plasma T3. Such differences in the ROS production by glycolytic and oxidative muscles were associated with differences in the membrane proton permeability and in the rate of free radical leakage within the respiratory chain. This is the first evidence which shows that in birds, the amount of ROS that the mitochondria release is dependent on: (1) their location within the muscle; (2) the type of muscle (glycolytic or oxidative) and (3) on the thyroid status. Reducing muscle mitochondrial ROS generation might be an important mechanism in birds to limit oxidative damage during periods of physiological stress.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Although the mechanisms regulating ion loss are poorly understood, a significant component is thought to involve paracellular efflux through pathways formed via tight junction proteins. The mammalian orthologue (claudin-4) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) tight junction protein, claudin-b, has been proposed to form a cation-selective barrier regulating the paracellular loss of Na+. The present study investigated the cellular localization and regulation of claudin-b, as well as its potential contribution to Na+ homeostasis in adult zebrafish acclimated to ion-poor water. Using a green fluorescent protein-expressing line of transgenic zebrafish, we found that claudin-b was expressed along the lamellar epithelium as well as on the filament in the inter-lamellar regions. Co-localization of claudin-b and Na+/K+-ATPase was observed, suggesting its interaction with mitochondrion-rich cells. Claudin-b also appeared to be associated with other cell types, including the pavement cells. In the kidney, claudin-b was expressed predominantly in the collecting tubules. In addition, exposure to ion-poor water caused a significant increase in claudin-b abundance as well as a decrease in Na+ efflux, suggesting a possible role for claudin-b in regulating paracellular Na+ loss. Interestingly, the whole-body uptake of a paracellular permeability marker, polyethylene glycol-400, increased significantly after prolonged exposure to ion-poor water, indicating that an increase in epithelial permeability is not necessarily coupled with an increase in passive Na+ loss. Overall, our study suggests that in ion-poor conditions, claudin-b may contribute to a selective reduction in passive Na+ loss in zebrafish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the light of recent controversial findings of leucine’s effect on energy homeostasis further clarification of the metabolic impact of dietary leucine supplementation is required. We examined the pharmacological and dietary effects of leucine on energy metabolism in the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), a well-established model for studies of alterations in leptin sensitivity and energy metabolism. We acutely administered leucine into the lateral ventricle (1.1 μg) of hamsters to characterize whether leucine exhibits anorexigenic properties in this species as has been described in other rodents. Next the catabolic effect of dietary administered leucine via supplemented rodent diet (15 % leucine), drinking water (17 g/L leucine) and oral gavages (10 mg/day); as well as the effect of subcutaneously (0.1 and 3 mg/day) and intraperitoneally (0.1, 3 and 6 mg/day) injected leucine which avoids the gastrointestinal-track was analyzed. Centrally administered leucine reduced 24 h food intake (by 32 %) and body weight. Both parameters were also reduced in hamsters with leucine supplemented diet, but this catabolic response was based on a pronounced taste aversion to the leucine-diet. In all other experiments, dietary leucine and peripheral injections of leucine had no effect on food intake, body weight and basal blood glucose levels. Our data suggest that in the Djungarian hamster dietary leucine fails to exhibit catabolic effects that would override the evolutionary conserved adaptations of the species which is critical for its survival.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In temperate mammalian species, hibernation is improved by increasing the levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the body. The saturation of fatty acids (FA) in both white adipose tissue (WAT) and membrane phospholipids of mammals often reflects their diet composition. We found that the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) accumulates large amounts of fat at the end of summer by gradually shifting to a fat-rich diet (queen carpenter ants, Camponotus felah). PUFA are almost absent in this diet (<1 % of total FA), which contains a high fraction of saturated (SFA) and mono-unsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids. We found similar low levels of PUFA in mouse-tailed bat WAT, but not in their heart total lipids. The expression of two appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) hypothalamic neuropeptides, AgRP and NPY, increased in parallel to the shift in diet and with fat gain in these bats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only documented example of specific pre-hibernation diet in bats, and one which reveals the most saturated FA composition ever documented in a mammal. We suggest that the increase in expression levels of NPY and AgRP may contribute to the observed diet shift and mass gain, and that the FA composition of the bat’s specialized diet is adaptive in the relatively high temperatures we recorded in both their winter and summer roosts.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, a recent study found that after exposure to a freezing stress that produced intracellular freezing in a proportion of nematodes, the resulting survival levels could be explained if those nematodes that froze intracellularly had died. We have thus re-examined the survival of intracellular freezing in this nematode. The ability to survive a freezing exposure that is likely to produce intracellular freezing (freezing at −10 °C) declines with culture age. In cultures that are fed regularly, the ability to survive freezing at −10 °C increases, but in starved cultures freezing survival declines. Survival of intracellular freezing in fed cultures was confirmed using cryomicroscopy, staining of cells with vital dyes and by freeze substitution and transmission electron microscopy. We have thus confirmed that P. davidi can survive intracellular freezing and shown that this ability is dependent upon them being well fed. The effect of culture conditions on the nutrient status of the nematodes should thus be an important factor in the design of experiments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Intermittent ammonia release exploits glutamine (Gln) as an intermediary nitrogen store. Here, we explore the relationship between temporal patterns of ammonia release and Gln accumulation in three littoral oniscideans from Southern California. Results are interpreted in terms of water availability, habitat, activity patterns, and ancestry. A two-way experimental design was used to test whether ammonia excretion and Gln accumulation follow a tidal or diel periodicity. Ammonia excretion was studied in the laboratory using chambers with or without available seawater and using an acid trap to collect volatile ammonia. Ligia occidentalis releases ammonia directly into seawater and accumulates Gln during low tide (48.9 ± 6.5 μmol g−1 at low tide, 24.1 ± 3.0 μmol g−1 at high tide), indicating that excretion is tidally constrained. Alloniscus perconvexus and Tylos punctatus can excrete ammonia directly into seawater or utilize volatilization. Both species burrow in sand by day and show a diel excretory pattern, accumulating Gln nocturnally (31.8 ± 2.7 μmol g−1 at dawn and 21.8 ± 2.3 μmol g−1 at dusk for A. perconvexus; 85.7 ± 15.1 μmol g−1 at dawn and 25.4 ± 2.9 μmol g−1 at dusk for T. punctatus) and liberating ammonia diurnally. Glutaminase shows higher activity in terrestrial (0.54–0.86 U g−1) compared to intertidal (0.25–0.31 U g−1) species, consistent with the need to generate high PNH3 for volatilization.

Although relationships between habitat and the visual system are well documented in most vertebrates, relatively few studies have examined this relationship in birds. Here, we compare eye shape and retinal topography across seven species from the family Phasianidae (Galliformes) that are diurnally active in either open or enclosed habitats. Species from enclosed habitats have significantly larger corneal diameters, relative to transverse diameters, than species from open habitats, which we predict serves to enhance visual sensitivity. Retinal topography, however, was similar across all seven species and consisted of a centrally positioned area centralis and a weak horizontal visual streak, with no discernible fovea. In the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), there was also a dorso-temporal extension of increased neuron density and, in some specimens, a putative area dorsalis. The total number of neurons in the retinal ganglion cell layer was correlated with retinal whole-mount area. Average and peak neuron densities were similar across species, with the exception of the Japanese quail, which had greater average and peak densities. Peak anatomical spatial resolving power was also similar among species, ranging from approximately 10–13 cycles/°.

In 40 % of the successful moth-capture flights, the moth exhibited distinctive evasive flight behavior, but the bat pursued the moth by following its flight path. When the distance to the moth was approximately 3–4 m, the bats increased the duration of the pulses to 65–95 ms, which is 2–3 times longer than those during landing flight (30–40 ms). The mean of 5.8 long pulses were emitted before the final buzz phase of moth capture, without strengthening the sound pressure level. The mean duration of long pulses (79.9 ± 7.9 ms) corresponded to three times the fluttering period of G. pryeri (26.5 × 3 = 79.5 ms). These findings indicate that the bats adjust the pulse duration to increase the number of temporal repetitions of fluttering information rather than to produce more intense sonar sounds to receive fine insect echoes. The bats exhibited Doppler-shift compensation for echoes returning from large static objects ahead, but not for echoes from target moths, even though the bats were focused on capturing the moths. Furthermore, the echoes of the Telemike recordings from target moths showed spectral glints of approximately 1–1.5 kHz caused by the fluttering of the moths but not amplitude glints because of the highly acoustical attenuation of ultrasound in the air, suggesting that spectral information may be more robust than amplitude information in echoes during moth capturing flight.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A question that has received much attention has been which step, respiratory or cardiovascular, provides the principal rate limitation to gas flux at MMR? Limitation analyses have principally focused on O2 fluxes, though the excess capacity of the lung for O2 ventilation and diffusion remains unexplained except as a safety factor. Analyses of MMR normally rely upon allometry and temperature to define these factors, but cannot account for much of the variation and often have narrow phylogenetic breadth. The unique aspect of our comparative approach was to use an interclass meta-analysis to examine cardio-respiratory variables during the increase from resting metabolic rate to MMR among vertebrates from fish to mammals, independent of allometry and phylogeny. Common patterns at MMR indicate universal principles governing O2 and CO2 transport in vertebrate cardiovascular and respiratory systems, despite the varied modes of activities (swimming, running, flying), different cardio-respiratory architecture, and vastly different rates of metabolism (endothermy vs. ectothermy). Our meta-analysis supports previous studies indicating a cardiovascular limit to maximal O2 transport and also implicates a respiratory system limit to maximal CO2 efflux, especially in ectotherms. Thus, natural selection would operate on the respiratory system to enhance maximal CO2 excretion and the cardiovascular system to enhance maximal O2 uptake. This provides a possible evolutionary explanation for the conundrum of why the respiratory system appears functionally over-designed from an O2 perspective, a unique insight from previous work focused solely on O2 fluxes. The results suggest a common gas transport blueprint, or Bauplan, in the vertebrate clade.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The process of epithelial HCO3− secretion is under endocrine control, therefore, in this study we aimed to characterize the involvement of transmembrane (tmACs) and soluble (sACs) adenylyl cyclases on the regulation of bicarbonate secretion (BCS) and water absorption in the intestine of the sea bream (Sparus aurata). We observed that all sections of sea bream intestine are able to secrete bicarbonate as measured by pH–Stat in Ussing chambers. In addition, gut sac preparations reveal net water absorption in all segments of the intestine, with significantly higher absorption rates in the anterior intestine that in the rectum. BCS and water absorption are positively correlated in all regions of the sea bream intestinal tract. Furthermore, stimulation of tmACs (10 μM FK + 500 μM IBMX) causes a significant decrease in BCS, bulk water absorption and short circuit current (Isc) in a region dependent manner. In turn, stimulation of sACs with elevated HCO3− results in a significant increase in BCS, and bulk water absorption in the anterior intestine, an action completely reversed by the sAC inhibitor KH7 (200 μM). Overall, the results reveal a functional relationship between BCS and water absorption in marine fish intestine and modulation by tmACs and sAC. In light of the present observations, it is hypothesized that the endocrine effects on intestinal BCS and water absorption mediated by tmACs are locally and reciprocally modulated by the action of sACs in the fish enterocyte, thus fine-tuning the process of carbonate aggregate production in the intestinal lumen.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared using a MgCl2/EGTA precipitation method and uptake experiments were conducted using a high speed filtration technique. 3H-d-Glucose uptake was stimulated by both sodium and potassium and these transport rates were almost doubled in the presence of an inside-negative-induced membrane potential. Kinetics of 3H-d-glucose influx were hyperbolic functions of both external Na+ or K+, and an induced membrane potential increased influx Jmax and lowered Km in both salts. 3H-d-Glucose influx versus [glucose] in both Na+ or K+ media also displayed Michaelis–Menten properties that were only slightly affected by induced membrane potential. Phloridzin was a poor inhibitor of 0.5 mM 3H-d-glucose influx, requiring at least 5 mM in NaCl and 10 mM in KCl to significantly reduce hexose transport. Several sugars (d-galactose, α-methyl-d-gluco-pyranoside, unlabeled d-glucose, d-fructose, and d-mannose) were used at 75 mM as potential inhibitors of 0.1 mM 3H-d-glucose influx. Only unlabeled d-glucose, d-fructose, and d-mannose significantly (p < 0.05) reduced labeled glucose transport. An additional experiment using increasing concentrations of d-mannose (0, 10, 25, 75, and 100 mM) showed this hexose to be an effective inhibitor of 0.1 mM 3H-d-glucose uptake at concentrations of 75 mM and higher. As a whole these results suggest that 3H-d-glucose transport by hepatopancreatic BBMV occurs by a carrier system that is able to use both Na+ and K+ as drivers, is enhanced by membrane potential, is relatively refractory to phloridzin, and is only inhibited by itself, d-fructose, and d-mannose. These properties are similar to those exhibited by the mammalian SLC5A9/SGLT4 transporter, suggesting that an invertebrate analogue of this protein may occur in shrimp.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To identify potential changes in synaptic transmission induced by auditory stimulation in NCM, we used a slice preparation for path-clamp recordings of synaptic currents in the NCM of adult zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata) sacrificed after sound isolation followed by exposure to conspecific song or silence. Although post-synaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic currents in the NCM of control and song-exposed birds did not present any differences regarding their frequency, amplitude and duration after song exposure, we observed a higher probability of generation of bursting glutamatergic currents after blockade of GABAergic transmission in song-exposed birds as compared to controls. Both song-exposed males and females presented an increase in the probability of the expression of bursting glutamatergic currents, however bursting was more commonly seen in males where they appeared even without blocking GABAergic transmission. Our data show that song exposure changes the excitability of the glutamatergic neuronal network, increasing the probability of the generation of bursts of glutamatergic currents, but does not affect basic parameters of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this study, cardiac performance was investigated in Xenopus laevis from 2 to 25 days post-fertilization (dpf). Larvae were reared under either normoxia or moderate hypoxia (PO2 = 110 mmHg), and each population was assessed in both normoxia and acute hypoxia. Heart rate (fh) of normoxic-reared larvae exhibited an early increase from 77 ± 1 beats min−1 at 2 dpf to 153 ± 1 beats min−1 at 4 dpf, followed by gradual decreases to 123 ± 3 beats min−1 at 25 dpf. Stroke volume (SV), 6 ± 1 nl, and cardiac output (CO), 0.8 ± 0.1 μl min−1, at 5 dpf both increased by more than 40-fold to 25 dpf with rapid larval growth (~30-fold increase in body mass). When exposed to acute hypoxia, normoxic-reared larvae increased fh and CO between 5 and 25 dpf. Increased SV in acute hypoxia, produced by increased end-diastolic volume (EDV), only occurred before 10 dpf. Hypoxic-reared larvae showed decreased acute hypoxic responses of EDV, SV and CO at 7 and 10 dpf. Over the period of 2–25 dpf, cardiac scaling with mass showed scaling coefficients of −0.04 (fh), 1.23 (SV) and 1.19 (CO), contrary to the cardiac scaling relationships described in birds and mammals. In addition, fh scaling in hypoxic-reared larvae was altered to a shallower slope of −0.01. Collectively, these results indicate that acute cardiac hypoxic responses develop before 5 dpf. Chronic hypoxia at a moderate level can not only modulate this cardiac reflex, but also changes cardiac scaling relationship with mass.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Control embryos originating from the same spawn were maintained in SW. Both SW and DSW embryos were examined after 24- and 48-h exposure. Nanoosmometric measurements of the embryonic fluids osmolality suggest that late embryos are confronted with the variations in external salinity and that they were able to slightly regulate their osmolality. Immunolocalization of Na+/K+ ATPase, NKCC and CFTR has shown that DSW-exposed embryos can limit ion losses due to compensatory physiological mechanisms. CFTR and NKCC were not observed in DSW embryos in the yolk sac ionocytes and in the tegumentary ionocytes of the gill slits. The quantification of mRNA indicated that NKA, NKCC1 and CFTR transcript levels increased from stage 10S to stage HT. At stage HT, following 48 h of DSW- or SW-exposure, different responses were observed according to salinity. These results, when compared to those obtained in D. labrax juveniles and adults long-term exposed to fresh water (FW), show that in embryos the physiological response following a short-term DSW exposure is different.

It also comprised two cysteine residues (cysteine 1360 and cysteine 1370) that are characteristic of N-acetyl-l-glutamate dependency.

However, the CPS I of L. caerulea, unlike that of R.catesbeiana, contained besides glutamate 308, methionine 305 instead of lysine 305, and thus represented a transitional form between Cps III and CPS I. Indeed, CPS I of L. caerulea could utilize glutamine or NH4+ as a substrate in vitro, but the activity obtained with glutamine + NH4+ reflected that obtained with NH4+ alone. Furthermore, only <5 % of the glutamine synthetase activity was present in the hepatic mitochondria, indicating that CPS I of L. caerulea did not have an effective supply of glutamine in vivo. Hence, our results confirmed that the evolution of CPS I from Cps III occurred in amphibians.

Eliminating inhibitory input did not affect the detection of the deviant pulses. Detection thresholds for deviant pulses increased significantly with increasing amplitude of standard pulses. Responses to deviant pulses occurred when the carrier frequencies of deviant and standard were sufficiently different, both when the deviant had a higher or lower carrier frequency than the standard. Recordings from receptor neurons revealed that TN-1 responses to the deviant pulses did not depend on the population response strength of the receptors, but on the distribution of the receptor cell activity. TN-1 responses to the deviant pulse occurred only when the standard and deviant pulses were transmitted by different groups of receptor cells.

Stress for instance is supposed to be capable of influencing fetal development, leading to adjustments of offspring’s later physiology. We examined whether prenatal stress (induced by exposure to strobe light) during early- to mid-gestation was capable of affecting later reproductive parameters in guinea pigs (Cavia aperea f. porcellus). Therefore, we measured the levels of testosterone and progesterone from the age of day 12–124 in prenatally stressed (PS, n = 20) and unaffected control animals (n = 24). Furthermore, we determined the timing of puberty and growth. Body weight development revealed significantly faster growth in PS females compared to control animals. The onset of first estrus was slightly earlier in PS females, however not significantly so. Cycle lengths and levels of progesterone differed between groups over the course of time with higher progesterone levels and more constant cycles among PS females compared to control females who displayed marked differences between first and subsequent cycles. Levels of testosterone did not differ between groups. We conclude that prenatal stress accelerates growth and maturity in females, but not in males.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The concentration of molecules captured along aesthetasc surfaces was found to increase with increased gap spacing between aesthetascs, flick speed, and distance from the proximal end of the aesthetasc, but these changes in morphology and flicking kinematics reduce the animal’s ability to take discrete samples of the odorant-laden fluid environment with each flick. Results suggest that antennule flicking allows discrete sampling of the time- and space-varying odorant signal, and high concentration odorant filaments can be distinguished from more diffuse, low concentration filaments through changes in both the timing and the encounter rate of odorant molecules to aesthetasc surfaces.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Here, we apply the same methodology to explore peripheral auditory function in the largest member of the cat family, the tiger (Panthera tigris). We measured SFOAEs in 9 unique ears of 5 anesthetized tigers. The tigers, housed at the Henry Doorly Zoo (Omaha, NE), were of both sexes and ranged in age from 3 to 10 years. SFOAE phase-gradient delays are significantly longer in tigers—by approximately a factor of two above 2 kHz and even more at lower frequencies—than in domestic cats (Felis catus), a species commonly used in auditory studies. Based on correlations between tuning and delay established in other species, our results imply that cochlear tuning in the tiger is significantly sharper than in domestic cat and appears comparable to that of humans. Furthermore, the SFOAE data indicate that tigers have a larger tonotopic mapping constant (mm/octave) than domestic cats. A larger mapping constant in tiger is consistent both with auditory brainstem response thresholds (that suggest a lower upper frequency limit of hearing for the tiger than domestic cat) and with measurements of basilar-membrane length (about 1.5 times longer in the tiger than domestic cat).",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

One species in which the function of plumage ornaments has been assessed is the Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis). Studies of a population breeding in Alabama (USA) have established that plumage ornaments signal quality, parental investment, and competitive ability in both sexes. Here we tested the additional hypotheses that (1) Eastern bluebird plumage ornamentation signals nest defense behavior in heterospecific competitive interactions and (2) individual variation in plumage ornamentation reflects underlying differences in circulating hormone levels. We also tested the potential for plumage ornaments to signal individual quality and parental investment in a population breeding in Oklahoma (USA). We found that Eastern bluebirds with more ornamented plumage are in better condition, initiate breeding earlier in the season, produce larger clutches, have higher circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, and more ornamented males have lower circulating androgen levels. Plumage coloration was not related to nest defense behavior. Thus, plumage ornamentation may be used by both sexes to assess the physiological condition and parental investment of prospective mates. Experimental manipulations of circulating hormone levels during molt are needed to define the role of hormones in plumage ornamentation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Bath application of both octopamine and serotonin enhances the synaptic responses of LG to sensory stimulation. We have shown previously (Araki et al. J Neurophysiol 94:2644–2652, 2005) that a serotonin-induced enhancement of the LG response was mediated by an increase in cAMP levels following activation of adenylate cyclase; however, octopamine acts independently. Here, we clarify how octopamine enhances the LG response during sensory stimulation using physiological and pharmacological analyses. When phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 was directly injected into the LG before biogenic amine application, it abolished the enhancing effect of octopamine on direct sensory input to the LG, but did not block indirect input via sensory interneurons or the effect of serotonin. Direct injection of IP3, and its analogue adenophostin A, into the LG increased the synaptic response of the LG to sensory stimulation. Thus, IP3 mediates octopamine-induced synaptic enhancement of the LG, but serotonin acts independently. These results indicate that both octopamine and serotonin enhance the synaptic responses of the LG to sensory stimulation, but that they activate two different signaling cascades in the LG.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In contrast to other strictly subterranean rodents, Ctenomys talarum exhibits activity on the surface during foraging and dispersion and hence, is exposed also to the aboveground environment. In this context, this species is a valuable model to explore how the interplay between underground and aboveground use affects the relationship among basal metabolic rate (BMR), cold-induced maximum metabolic rate (MMR), shivering (ST), and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). In this work, we provide the first evidence of the presence of NST, including the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and shivering thermogenesis in Ctenomys talarum, a species belonging to the most numerous subterranean genus, endemic to South America. Our results show no differences in BMR, cold-induced MMR, and NST between cold- (15 °C) and warm- (25 °C) acclimated individuals. Furthermore, thermal acclimation had no effect on the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in BAT. Only cytochrome c oxidase (COX) content and activity increased during cold acclimation. When interscapular BAT was removed, NST decreased more than 30 %, whereas cold-induced MMR remained unchanged. All together, these data suggest that cold-induced MMR reaches a maximum in warm-acclimated individuals and so a probable ceiling in NST and UCP1 expression in BAT. Possible thermogenic mechanisms explaining the increase in the oxidative capacity, mediated by COX in BAT of cold-acclimated individuals and the role of ST in subterranean life habits are proposed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Insights from a radiometabolism study in guinea pigs,"Measurement of hair cortisol has become popular in the evaluation of chronic stress in various species. However, a sound validation is still missing. Therefore, deposition of radioactivity in hair and excretion into feces and urine after repeated injection of 3H-cortisol was studied in guinea pigs (n = 8). Each animal was given intraperitoneally 243.6 kBq 3H-cortisol/day on 3 successive days. After the first injection, all voided excreta were collected for 3 days. After the second injection, hair was shaved off the animals’ back and newly grown hair was obtained on day 7. Following methanol extraction, radiolabeled and unlabeled glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in fecal and hair samples were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA). In feces, maximum radioactivity was reached 8 h (median) post each injection, whereas maxima in urine were detected in the first samples (median 2.5 h). Metabolites excreted into feces (13.3 % ± 3.7) or urine (86.7 %) returned nearly to background levels. HPLC of fecal extracts showed minor variation between individuals and sexes. In hair, small amounts of radioactivity were present. However, two EIAs detected large amounts of unlabeled GCM, including high levels at the position of the cortisol standard; radioactivity was absent in this fraction, demonstrating that 3H-cortisol was metabolized. Furthermore, large amounts of immunoreactivity coinciding with a radioactive peak at the elution position of cortisone were found. These results show for the first time that only small amounts of systemically administered radioactive glucocorticoids are deposited in hair of guinea pigs, while measurement of large amounts of unlabeled GCM strongly suggests local production of glucocorticoids in hair follicles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Inactivation of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve by local anaesthesia revealed its role in the perception of intensity/inclination of the magnetic field by abolishing the conditioned response (CR). In contrast, experiments with 90° direction shifts clearly showed the normal conditioning effect during trigeminal inactivation. In experiments under red light and in darkness, CR occurred in case of both the intensity/inclination stimulation and 90° direction shifts, respectively.

Given the presumed effects of gill remodeling on diffusing capacity, the goals of the current study were (1) to determine the consequences of increased aerobic O2 demand (swimming) on gill remodelling and (2) to assess the consequences of the presence or absence of the ILCM on aerobic swimming capacity. Fish acclimated to 7 °C exhibited a marked increase in the ILCM which occupied, on average, 70.0 ± 4.1 % of the total interlamellar channel area in comparison to an average ILCM area of only 28.3 ± 0.9 % in fish acclimated to 25 °C. Incrementally increasing swimming velocity in fish at 7 °C to achieve a maximum aerobic swimming speed (UCRIT) within approximately 3 h resulted in a marked loss of the ILCM area to 44.8 ± 3.5 %. Fish acclimated to 7 °C were subjected to 35 min swimming trials at 30, 60 or 80 % UCRIT revealing that significant loss of the ILCM occurred at swimming speeds exceeding 60 % UCRIT. Prior exposure of cold water-acclimated fish to hypoxia to induce shedding of the ILCM did not affect swimming performance when assessed under normoxic conditions (control fish UCRIT = 2.34 ± 0.30 body lengths s−1; previously hypoxic fish UCRIT = 2.99 ± 0.14 body lengths s−1) or the capacity to raise rates of O2 consumption with increasing swimming speeds. Because shedding of ILCM during UCRIT trials complicated the interpretation of experiments designed to evaluate the impact of the ILCM on swimming performance, additional experiments using a more rapid ‘ramp’ protocol were performed to generate swimming scores. Neither prior hypoxia exposure nor a previous swim to UCRIT (both protocols are known to cause loss of the ILCM) affected swimming scores (the total distance swum during ramp UCRIT trials). However, partitioning all data based on the extent of ILCM coverage upon cessation of the swimming trial revealed that fish with less than 40 % ILCM coverage exhibited a significantly greater swimming score (539 ± 86 m) than fish with greater than 50 % ILCM coverage (285 ± 70 m). Thus, while loss of the ILCM at swimming speeds exceeding 60 % UCRIT confounds the interpretation of experiments designed to assess the impact of the ILCM on swimming performance, we suggest that the shedding of the ILCM, in itself, coupled with improved swimming scores in fish exhibiting low ILCM coverage (<40 %), provide evidence that the ILCM in goldfish acclimated to cold water (7 °C) is indeed an impediment to aerobic swimming capacity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The most intense dive response occurs during forced submersion which conserves blood oxygen for the brain and heart, thereby preventing asphyxiation. In free-diving animals, the dive response is less profound, and energy metabolism remains aerobic. However, even this relatively moderate bradycardia seems diametrically opposed to the normal cardiovascular response (i.e., tachycardia and peripheral vasodilation) during physical exertion. As a result, there has been a long-standing paradox regarding how aquatic mammals and birds exercise while submerged. We hypothesized based on cardiovascular modeling that heart rate must increase to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to active muscles. Here, we show that heart rate (HR) does indeed increase with flipper or fluke stroke frequency (SF) during voluntary, aerobic dives in Weddell seals (HR = 1.48SF − 8.87) and bottlenose dolphins (HR = 0.99SF + 2.46), respectively, two marine mammal species with different evolutionary lineages. These results support our hypothesis that marine mammals maintain aerobic muscle metabolism while swimming submerged by combining elements of both dive and exercise responses, with one or the other predominating depending on the level of exertion.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, several independent lines of evidence suggest that the toxicity of PSCs is mediated, in part, by ambient temperature and that the effect of small changes in ambient temperature is on par with several fold changes in PSC concentration. This review describes the disparate lines of evidence for temperature-dependent toxicity and the putative mechanisms causing this phenomenon. A model is described that integrates thermal physiology with temperature-dependent toxicity to predict maximal dietary intake of plant secondary compounds by mammalian herbivores. The role of temperature-dependent toxicity is considered with respect to the observed changes in herbivorous species attributed to climate change. Possible future investigations and the effects of temperature-dependent toxicity on other endotherms are presented. Temperature-dependent toxicity has the potential to apply to all endotherms that consume toxins.

The effects of elevated CO2 on marine calcifying organisms have been extensively studied; however, effects of imminent CO2 levels on teleost acid–base and respiratory physiology have yet to be examined. Examination of these physiological processes, using a paired experimental design, showed that 24 h exposure to 1,000 and 1,900 μatm CO2 resulted in a characteristic compensated respiratory acidosis response in the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta). Time course experiments showed the onset of acidosis occurred after 15 min of exposure to 1,900 and 1,000 μatm CO2, with full compensation by 2 and 4 h, respectively. 1,900-μatm exposure also resulted in significantly increased intracellular white muscle pH after 24 h. No effect of 1,900 μatm was observed on branchial acid flux; however, exposure to hypercapnia and HCO3− free seawater compromised compensation. This suggests branchial HCO3− uptake rather than acid extrusion is part of the compensatory response to low-level hypercapnia. Exposure to 1,900 μatm resulted in downregulation in branchial carbonic anhydrase and slc4a2 expression, as well as decreased Na+/K+ ATPase activity after 24 h of exposure. Infusion of bovine carbonic anhydrase had no effect on blood acid–base status during 1,900 μatm exposures, but eliminated the respiratory impacts of 1,000 μatm CO2. The results of the current study clearly show that predicted near-future CO2 levels impact respiratory gas transport and acid–base balance. While the full physiological impacts of increased blood HCO3− are not known, it seems likely that chronically elevated blood HCO3− levels could compromise several physiological systems and furthermore may explain recent reports of increased otolith growth during exposure to elevated CO2.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hypoxia sensitivity originates from the high intrinsic rate of ATP consumption of brain tissue, accompanied by the release of glutamate, leading to the opening of ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs). The relative expression levels of the four NMDAR-2 (NR2) subunits change during mammalian development with higher levels of units NR2B and NR2D observed during early development and correlated with hypoxic tolerance during embryonic and neonatal stages of development. Higher levels of NR2D are also abundant in brains of hypoxia tolerant species such as the crucian carp. The subterranean mole-rat, Spalax spends its life underground in sealed burrows and has developed a wide range of adaptations to this special niche including hypoxia-tolerance. In this study, we compared the in vivo mRNA expression of NR2 subunits in the brains of embryonic, neonatal and adult Spalax and rat. Our results demonstrate that under normoxic conditions, mRNA levels of NR2D are higher in Spalax than in rat at all developmental stages studied and are similar to levels in neonatal rat and in other hypoxia/anoxia tolerant species. Furthermore, under hypoxia SpalaxNR2D mRNA levels increase while no response was observed in rat. Similarly, hypoxia induces an increase in mRNA levels of Spalax NR2A, claimed to promote neuronal survival.

Extracellular recordings from the valve junction (VJ) where afferent vessels join the heart tube were combined with optical recording of contractions. Action potential bursts at VJs occurred in advance of heart tube and afferent vessel contractions. Transections of nerves were performed to reduce the output of the central pattern generator reaching the heart tube. Muscle contractions persisted but with a less regular rhythm despite normal central pattern generator rhythmicity. With no connections between the central pattern generator and heart tube, a much slower rhythm became manifest. Heart excitor neuron recordings showed that peripheral activity might contribute to the disruption of centrally entrained contractions. In the model presented, peripheral activity would normally modify the activity actually reaching the muscle.

However, only a few studies have explored the association between antioxidant levels and life-history strategies comparing a large number of species. Here we used an extensive dataset of 125 species of birds to investigate the association between concentrations of antioxidants (carotenoids and vitamin E) in the liver, which is the main storage organ for fat-soluble antioxidants, and life-history and morphology. We found that high liver antioxidant concentrations were associated with life-history strategies characterized by “live slow, die old”, in clear contrast to previous studies reporting a relationship between high plasma antioxidants and life-histories characterized by “live fast, die young”. Thus, high carotenoid concentrations were present in species with large body, brain and egg sizes, high absolute metabolic rate and a resident lifestyle, while high vitamin E concentrations were present in species with large brain size and long life span and incubation period. Our results indicate that antioxidants and life-histories coevolve, and that this may be mediated by positive fitness consequences of the accumulation of liver antioxidants, as species with higher antioxidant levels live longer.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

During cold acclimation to 10 °C, the time lag to adjust the stress gene expression to the current environmental temperature proved to exceed 1 week, thereby highlighting the importance of long-term experiments in evaluating the species’ acclimation capacities. Cold and warm-acclimated specimens of P. varians can mobilise the heat shock response (HSR) at temperatures above those experienced in nature, which suggests that the species is potentially capable of expanding its upper thermal range.

We investigated how flying locusts alter wing-flapping symmetry in response to a looming object approaching from the side. Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) were tethered to a rotatable shaft that allowed them to initiate a banked turn. A visual stimulus of an expending disk on one side of the locust was used to evoke steering while recording the change in wingbeat kinematics and electromyography (EMG) of metathoracic wing depressors. Locusts responded to the looming object by rolling to the contralateral direction. During turning, EMG of hindwing depressors showed an omission of one action potential in the subalar depressor (M129) of the hindwing inside the turn. This omission was associated with increased pronation of the same wing, reducing its angle-of-attack during the downstroke. The link between spike-omission in M129 and wing pronation was verified by stimulating the hindwing depressor muscles with an artificial motor pattern that included the misfire of M129. These results suggest that hindwing pronation is instrumental in rotating the body to the side opposite of the approaching threat.

The principal gill salt transport mechanisms proposed to underlie the ability of the better-known taxa to occupy these specific habitats are examined here. Traditional thinking suggests that a graduated series of successively stronger adaptive mechanisms may have driven the occupation of ever more dilute osmotic niches, culminating in the conquest of freshwater and dry land. However, when habitat and osmoregulatory parameters are analyzed quantitatively against the phylogenies of the taxa examined, as illustrated here using a palaemonid shrimp clade, their association becomes questionable and may hold true only in specific cases. We also propose a putative evolution for gill epithelial ion pump and transporter arrangement in a eubrachyuran crab clade whose lineages occupy distinct osmotic niches. By including the systematics of these selected groups, this review incorporates the notion of a protracted time scale, here termed ‘phylophysiology’, into decapod osmoregulation, allowing the examination of putative physiological transformations and their underlying evolutionary processes. This approach assumes that species are temporally linked, a factor that can impart phylogenetic structuring, which must be considered in comparative studies.

Three stimulants of similar shape and size but different textures were used: a tibia from the hunting spider Heteropoda venatoria (potential predator), a tibia from the orb-web spider Argiope bruennichi (less likely predator), and a glass rod. Each stimulus session comprised a first gentle contact and a second strong contact. The evoked behavioral responses were classified into four categories: aversion, aggression, antennal search, and no response. Regardless of the stimulants, the crickets exhibited antennal search and aversion most frequently in response to the first and second stimuli, respectively. The frequency of aversion was significantly higher to the tibia of H. venatoria than to other stimulants. The most striking observation was that aggressive responses were exclusive to the H. venatoria tibia. To specify the hair type that induced aggression, we manipulated two types of common hairs (bristle and fine) on the tibia of the predatory spider.

We examined the involvement of the Na+/K+ pump in modulating its bursting activity by applying a static magnetic field. Whole snail brains and Br neuron were exposed to the 10-mT static magnetic field for 15 min. Biochemical data showed that Na+/K+-ATPase activity increased almost twofold after exposure of snail brains to the static magnetic field. Similarly, 31P NMR data revealed a trend of increasing ATP consumption and increase in intracellular pH mediated by the Na+/H+ exchanger in snail brains exposed to the static magnetic field. Importantly, current clamp recordings from the Br neuron confirmed the increase in activity of the Na+/K+ pump after exposure to the static magnetic field, as the magnitude of ouabain’s effect measured on the membrane resting potential, action potential, and interspike interval duration was higher in neurons exposed to the magnetic field. Metabolic pathways through which the magnetic field influenced the Na+/K+ pump could involve phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, as blocking these processes abolished the effect of the static magnetic field.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Sequencing functionally relevant regions of the short wavelength sensitive type 1 (SWS1) opsin gene that is responsible for modulating the extent of SWS1 UV sensitivity in birds allows predictions to be made about the visual system’s UV sensitivity in species where direct physiological or behavioral measures would be impractical or unethical. Here, we present SWS1 segment sequence data from representative species of three avian lineages for which visually based cues for foraging and communication have been investigated to varying extents. We also present a preliminary phylogenetic analysis and ancestral character state reconstructions of key spectral tuning sites along the SWS1 opsin based on our sequence data. The results suggest ubiquitous ultraviolet SWS1 sensitivity (UVS) in both paleognaths, including extinct moa (Emeidae), and parrots, including the nocturnal and flightless kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), and in most, but not all, songbird (oscine) lineages, and confirmed violet sensitivity (VS) in two suboscine families.

There were 4,530 bp coding for 1,510 amino acids in the cftr cDNA sequence from A. testudineus. The branchial mRNA expression of cftr in fish kept in freshwater was low (<50 copies of transcript per ng cDNA), but significant increases were observed in fish acclimated to seawater for 1 day (92-fold) or 6 days (219-fold). Branchial Cftr expression was detected in fish acclimated to seawater but not in the freshwater control, indicating that Cl− excretion through the apical Cftr of the branchial epithelium was essential to seawater acclimation. More importantly, fish exposed to ammonia also exhibited a significant increase (12-fold) in branchial mRNA expression of cftr, with Cftr being expressed in a type of Na+/K+-ATPase-immunoreactive cells that was apparently different from the type involved in seawater acclimation. It is probable that Cl− excretion through Cftr generated a favorable electrical potential across the apical membrane to drive the excretion of $$ {\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ against a concentration gradient through a yet to be determined transporter, but it led to a slight loss of endogenous Cl−. Since ammonia exposure also resulted in significant decreases in blood pH, [HCO3−] and [total CO2] in A. testudineus, it can be deduced that active $$ {\text{NH}}_{4}^{ + } $$ excretion could also be driven by the exit of HCO3− through the apical Cftr.

Yet, previous studies did not investigate the relationship between echolocation, flight speed, aerial manoeuvres and metabolism. We re-evaluated the ‘no-cost’ hypothesis, by quantifying the echolocation pulse rate, the number of aerial manoeuvres (landings and U-turns), and the costs of transport in the 5-g insectivorous bat Rhogeessa io (Vespertilionidae). On average, bats (n = 15) travelled at 1.76 ± 0.36 m s−1 and performed 11.2 ± 6.1 U-turns and 2.8 ± 2.9 ground landings when flying in an octagonal flight cage. Bats made more U-turns with decreasing wing loading (body weight divided by wing area). At flight, bats emitted 19.7 ± 2.7 echolocation pulses s−1 (range 15.3–25.8 pulses s−1), and metabolic rate averaged 2.84 ± 0.95 ml CO2 min−1, which was more than 16 times higher than at rest. Bats did not echolocate while not engaged in flight. Costs of transport were not related to the rate of echolocation pulse emission or the number of U-turns, but increased with increasing number of landings; probably as a consequence of slower travel speed when staying briefly on ground. Metabolic power of flight was lower than predicted for R. io under the assumption that energetic costs of echolocation call production is additive to the aerodynamic costs of flight. Results of our experiment are consistent with the notion that echolocation does not add large energetic costs to the aerodynamic power requirements of flight in bats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Both species showed differential regulation of HIF-1α during hibernation. HIF-1α protein levels increased significantly in skeletal muscle of both species when animals entered torpor, as well as in bat liver. HIF-1α mRNA levels correlated with the protein increase in bat skeletal muscle and liver but not in squirrel skeletal muscle. Antisense HIF-1α transcripts were identified in skeletal muscle of both hibernators. The expression of antisense HIF-1α was reduced in skeletal muscle of torpid bats compared with euthermic controls, suggesting that release of inhibition by the antisense RNA contributes to regulating HIF-1α translation in this tissue during torpor. The expression of miR-106b, a microRNA associated with HIF-1α regulation, also decreased during torpor in both skeletal muscle and liver of bats and in ground squirrel skeletal muscle. These data present the first evidence that non-coding RNA provides novel post-transcriptional mechanisms of HIF-1α regulation when hibernators descend into deep cold torpor, and also demonstrate that these mechanisms are conserved in two divergent mammalian orders (Rodentia and Chiroptera).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Despite extensive research on thermoregulatory adjustments during hibernation, less is known about transitions in thermoregulatory state, particularly under natural conditions. Laboratory studies on hibernating ground squirrels have demonstrated that thermoregulatory adjustments may occur over short intervals when animals undergo several brief, preliminary torpor bouts prior to entering multiday torpor. These short torpor bouts have been suggested to reflect a resetting of hypothalamic regions that control Tb or to precondition animals before they undergo deep, multiday torpor. Here, we examined continuous records of Tb in 240 arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) prior to hibernation in the wild and in captivity. In free-living squirrels, Tb began to decline 45 days prior to hibernation, and average Tb had decreased 4.28 °C at the onset of torpor. Further, we found that 75 % of free-living squirrels and 35 % of captive squirrels entered bouts of multiday torpor with a single Tb decline and without previously showing short preliminary bouts. This study provides evidence that adjustments in the thermoregulatory component of hibernation begin far earlier than previously demonstrated. The gradual reduction in Tb is likely a component of the suite of metabolic and behavioral adjustments, controlled by an endogenous, circannual rhythm, that vary seasonally in hibernating ground squirrels.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We have extended these results by (1) increasing the period of exposure to low PO2 and by (2) testing the sensitivity of the pyloric network to changes in PO2 that are within the narrow range normally experienced by the lobster (1 to 6 kPa). We found that the pyloric network rhythm was indeed altered by changes in PO2 within the range typically observed in vivo. Furthermore, a previous study showed that the lateral pyloric constrictor motor neuron (LP) contributes to the O2 sensitivity of the pyloric network. Here, we expanded on this idea by testing the hypothesis that pyloric pacemaker neurons also contribute to pyloric O2 sensitivity. A 2-h exposure to 1 kPa PO2, which was twice the period used previously, decreased the frequency of an isolated group of pacemaker neurons, suggesting that changes in the rhythmogenic properties of these cells contribute to pyloric O2 sensitivity during long-term near-anaerobic (anaerobic threshold, 0.7–1.2 kPa) conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Unique among ants, the workers regularly dive and swim in the pitcher’s digestive fluid to forage for food. High-speed motion analysis revealed that C. schmitzi ants swim at the surface with all legs submerged, with an alternating tripod pattern. Compared to running, swimming involves lower stepping frequencies and larger phase delays within the legs of each tripod. Swimming ants move front and middle legs faster and keep them more extended during the power stroke than during the return stroke. Thrust estimates calculated from three-dimensional leg kinematics using a blade-element approach confirmed that forward propulsion is mainly achieved by the front and middle legs. The hind legs move much less, suggesting that they mainly serve for steering. Experiments with tethered C. schmitzi ants showed that characteristic swimming movements can be triggered by submersion in water. This reaction was absent in another Camponotus species investigated.

Our measurements revealed the presence of three types of photoreceptors, maximally sensitive in the UV, green and red areas of the spectrum.

As a first step in addressing this shortcoming, we investigated the O2 binding characteristics of Taiwanese brown-toothed shrew (Episoriculusfumidus) Hb and its temperature and pH dependence in the absence and presence of anionic red blood cell effectors. Although comparative data regarding the intrinsic O2 affinity of other shrew species are currently unavailable, our data suggest that the sensitivity of this high-elevation endemic species’ Hb to allosteric effector molecules is similar to that of the two lowland species of white-toothed (crocidurine) shrews examined to date. The efficient exploitation of blood O2 reserves by E. fumidus appears to be achieved via synergistic modulation of O2 affinity by Cl− and organic phosphates that moreover dramatically lowers the overall enthalpy of oxygenation of their Hb. Oxygen unloading is presumably further enhanced by a relatively high Bohr effect (ΔLog P50/ΔpH = −0.69) and marked reduction in the titratable histidine content (predicted low proton buffering value) of the component globin chains relative to human HbA.

Over the past decade, molecular tools have been used to address some of the downstream components of these processes and these are incorporated to better understand the roles played by carbohydrates and their regulatory paths. Glucose metabolism remains a contentious area as many fish species are traditionally considered glucose intolerant and, therefore, one might expect that the use and storage of glucose would be considered of minor importance. However, the actual picture is not so clear since the apparent intolerance of fish to carbohydrates is not evident in herbivorous and omnivorous species and even in carnivorous species, glucose is important for specific tissues and/or for specific activities. Thus, our aim is to up-date carbohydrate metabolism in fish, placing it to the context of these new experimental tools and its relationship to dietary intake.

Remarkably, pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) enter SW directly following yolk absorption and gravel emergence at a size of 0.2 g. To survive this exceptional SW migration, pink salmon were hypothesized to develop hypo-osmoregulatory abilities prior to yolk absorption and emergence. To test this, alevins (pre-yolk absorption) and fry (post-yolk absorption) were transferred from FW in darkness to SW under simulated natural photoperiod (SNP). Ionoregulatory status was assessed at 0, 1 and 5 days post-transfer. SW alevins showed no evidence of hypo-osmoregulation, marked by significant water loss and no increase in gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) immunoreactive (IR) cell frequency. Conversely, fry maintained water balance, upregulated gill NKA activity by 50 %, increased the NKA α1b/α1a mRNA expression ratio by sixfold and increased NKCC IR cell frequency. We also provide the first evidence of photoperiod-triggered smoltification in pink salmon, as fry exposed to SNP in FW exhibited preparatory changes in gill NKA activity and α1 subunit expression similar to fry exposed to SNP in SW. Interestingly, fry incurred larger increases in whole body Na+ than alevins following both SW and FW + SNP exposure (40 and 20 % in fry vs. 0 % in alevins). The ability to incur and tolerate large ion loads may underlie a novel mechanism for maintaining water balance in SW prior to completing hypo-osmoregulatory development.

The AM retinae are moveable and can be pointed at stimuli within their range of motion, but salticids have to turn to bring targets into this frontal zone in the first place. We describe how the front-facing pair of secondary eyes (anterior lateral, AL) mediates this through a series of whole-body ‘tracking saccades’ in response to computer-generated stimuli. We investigated the ‘response area’ of the AL eyes and show a clear correspondence between the physical margins of the retina and stimulus position at the onset of the first saccade. Saccade frequency is maximal at the margin of AL and AM fields of view. Furthermore, spiders markedly increase the velocity with which higher magnitude tracking saccades are carried out. This has the effect that the time during which vision is impaired due to motion blur is kept at an almost constant low level, even during saccades of large magnitude.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

From the beginning, sulfur has been inexorably entwined with the evolution of organisms. Reduced sulfur, prevalent in the prebiotic Earth and supplied from interstellar sources, was an integral component of early life as it could provide energy through oxidization, even in a weakly oxidizing environment, and it spontaneously reacted with iron to form iron–sulfur clusters that became the earliest biological catalysts and structural components of cells. The ability to cycle sulfur between reduced and oxidized states may have been key in the great endosymbiotic event that incorporated a sulfide-oxidizing α-protobacteria into a host sulfide-reducing Archea, resulting in the eukaryotic cell. As eukaryotes slowly adapted from a sulfidic and anoxic (euxinic) world to one that was highly oxidizing, numerous mechanisms developed to deal with increasing oxidants; namely, oxygen, and decreasing sulfide. Because there is rarely any reduced sulfur in the present-day environment, sulfur was historically ignored by biologists, except for an occasional report of sulfide toxicity. Twenty-five years ago, it became evident that the organisms in sulfide-rich environments could synthesize ATP from sulfide, 10 years later came the realization that animals might use sulfide as a signaling molecule, and only within the last 4 years did it become apparent that even mammals could derive energy from sulfide generated in the gastrointestinal tract. It has also become evident that, even in the present-day oxic environment, cells can exploit the redox chemistry of sulfide, most notably as a physiological transducer of oxygen availability.

Here we use the synchronous display of mating signals in males of the tropical katydid Mecopoda elongata in order to assess the influence of nocturnal rainforest noise on signal perception. Loud background noise may disturb chorus synchrony either by masking the signals of males or by interaction of noisy events with the song oscillator. Phase-locked synchrony of males was studied under various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using either native noise or the audio component of noise (<9 kHz). Synchronous entrainment was lost at a SNR of −3 dB when native noise was used, whereas with the audio component still 50 % of chirp periods matched the pacer period at a SNR of −7 dB. Since the chirp period of solo singing males remained almost unaffected by noise, our results suggest that masking interference limits chorus synchrony by rendering conspecific signals ambiguous. Further, entrainment with periodic artificial signals indicates that synchrony is achieved by ignoring heterospecific signals and attending to a conspecific signal period. Additionally, the encoding of conspecific chirps was studied in an auditory neuron under the same background noise regimes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, short- and long-term stress (often problematically termed acute and chronic stress, respectively) can interact in unpredictable ways. When animals experience trapping and handling stress before blood, faeces and/or urine is sampled, the interaction of short- and long-term stress can confound interpretation of the data, a fact not always acknowledged in studies of stress in free-living vertebrates. This review examines how stress metrics can be confounded when estimates of HPA-axis activation are collected for free-living vertebrates and outlines some approaches that can be used to help circumvent the influence of potentially confounding factors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, it has never been conclusively shown which cells constitute their major presynaptic elements. LPTCs are supposed to be rendered directionally selective by integrating excitatory as well as inhibitory input from many local motion detectors. Based on their stratification in the different layers of the lobula plate, the columnar cells T4 and T5 are likely candidates to provide some of this input. To study their role in motion detection, we performed whole-cell recordings from LPTCs in Drosophila with T4 and T5 cells blocked using two different genetically encoded tools. In these flies, motion responses were abolished, while flicker responses largely remained. We thus demonstrate that T4 and T5 cells indeed represent those columnar cells that provide directionally selective motion information to LPTCs. Contrary to previous assumptions, flicker responses seem to be largely mediated by a third, independent pathway. This work thus represents a further step towards elucidating the complete motion detection circuitry of the fly.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We found divergent strategies for coping with desiccation stress in two species of immigrans group—D. immigrans and D. nasuta. In contrast to clinal variation for body melanization in D. immigrans, cuticular lipid mass showed a positive cline in D. nasuta across a latitudinal transect (10°46′–31°43′N). Based on isofemale lines variability, body melanization showed positive correlation with desiccation resistance in D. immigrans but not in D. nasuta. The use of organic solvents has supported water proofing role of cuticular lipids in D. nasuta but not in D. immigrans. A comparative analysis of water budget of these two species showed that higher water content, reduced rate of water loss and greater dehydration tolerance confer higher desiccation resistance in D. immigrans while the reduced rate of water loss is the only possible mechanism to enhance desiccation tolerance in D. nasuta. We found that carbohydrates act as metabolic fuel during desiccation stress in both the species, whereas their rates of utilization differ significantly between these two species. Further, acclimation to dehydration stress improved desiccation resistance due to increase in the level of carbohydrates in D. immigrans but not in D. nasuta. Thus, populations of D. immigrans and D. nasuta have evolved different water balance mechanisms under shared environmental conditions. Multiple measures of desiccation resistance in D. immigrans but reduction in water loss in D. nasuta are consistent with their different levels of adaptive responses to wet and dry conditions on the Indian subcontinent.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The Ca2+ rise produces negative feedback by modulating the mechanoreceptor current and regulates Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ currents. However, nothing is known about Ca2+ buffering in VS-3 neurons. Dynamic changes in VS-3 neuron intracellular [Ca2+] were measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OG488) to understand Ca2+ buffering and clearance. Intracellular OG488 concentration increased slowly over more than 2 h as it diffused through a sharp intracellular microelectrode and spread through the cell. This slow increase was used to measure endogenous Ca2+ buffering and clearance by the added buffer technique, with OG488 acting as both added exogenous buffer and Ca2+ indicator. [Ca2+] was raised for brief periods by regular action potential firing, produced by pulsed electric current injection through the microelectrode. The resulting rise and fall of [Ca2+] were well fitted by the single compartment model of Ca2+ dynamics. With earlier ratiometric [Ca2+] estimates, these data gave an endogenous Ca2+ binding ratio of 684. Strong Ca2+ buffering may assist these neurons to deal with rapid changes in mechanical inputs.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

At the molecular level, they are composed of a set of clock genes that participate in transcriptional–translational feedback loops to control their own expression and that of downstream output genes. These clocks are synchronized with the environment, although entrainment by external periodic cues remains little explored in fish. In this work, partial cDNA sequences of clock genes representing both positive (Clock) and negative (Period1, Period2) elements of the molecular feedback loops were obtained from the nocturnal flatfish Senegalese sole, a relevant species for aquaculture and chronobiology. All of the above genes exhibited high identities with their respective teleost clock genes, and Per–Arnt–Sim or basic helix–loop–helix binding domains were recognized in their primary structure. They showed a widespread distribution through the animal body and some of them displayed daily mRNA rhythms in central (retina, optic tectum, diencephalon, and cerebellum) and peripheral (liver) tissues. These rhythms were most robust in retina and liver, exhibiting marked Period1 and Clock daily oscillations in transcript levels as revealed by ANOVA and cosinor analysis. Interestingly, expression profiles were inverted in retina and optic tectum compared to liver. Such differences suggest the existence of tissue-dependent zeitgebers for clock gene expression in this species (i.e., light for retina and optic tectum and feeding time for liver). This study provides novel insight into the location of the molecular clocks (central vs. peripheral) and their different phasing and synchronization pathways, which contributes to better understand the teleost circadian systems and its plasticity.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It is widely assumed that the circadian system is adapted to local cues, which vary enormously across habitats, yet the comparative data necessary for testing this idea are lacking. We examined photic and thermal resetting of the circadian clock in five species of Anolis lizards whose microhabitats differ in the amounts of sun and shade. The primary circadian oscillator in Anolis is the pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin. A flow-through culture system was employed to measure rhythmic melatonin output from individually cultured pineal glands. All species showed temperature-compensated circadian rhythms of pineal melatonin. Light caused significant phase delays of the melatonin rhythm, and this effect varied among species. Controlling for phylogenetic differences, the results indicate that the pineal glands of shade-dwelling species are more sensitive to photic resetting than species living in more brightly illuminated habitats. The differences were not due to variation in free-running period, but may be due to variation in oscillator phase and/or robustness. Surprisingly, thermal resetting was not statistically significant. Overall, the results suggest that the Anolis circadian system is adapted to photic habitat.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Rainbow trout were confined in fork-length matched pairs for 48–72 h, and social rank was assigned based on behaviour. Dominant and subordinate fish were then exposed individually to graded hypoxia (final water PO2, PwO2 = 40 Torr). Catecholamine mobilization profiles differed between dominant and subordinate fish. Whereas dominant fish exhibited generally low circulating catecholamine levels until a distinct threshold for release was reached (PwO2 = 51.5 Torr corresponding to arterial PO2, PaO2 = 24.1 Torr), plasma catecholamine concentrations in subordinate fish were more variable and identification of a distinct threshold for release was problematic. Among fish that mobilized catecholamines (i.e. circulating catecholamines rose above the 95% confidence interval around the baseline value), however, the circulating levels achieved in subordinate fish were significantly higher (459.9 ± 142.2 nmol L−1, mean ± SEM, N = 12) than those in dominant fish (130.9 ± 37.9 nmol L−1, N = 12). The differences in catecholamine mobilization occurred despite similar P50 values in dominant (22.0 ± 1.5 Torr, N = 6) and subordinate (22.1 ± 2.2 Torr, N = 8) fish, and higher PaO2 values in subordinate fish under severely hypoxic conditions (i.e. PwO2 < 60 Torr). The higher PaO2 values of subordinate fish likely reflected the greater ventilatory rates and amplitudes exhibited by these fish during severe hypoxia. At the most severe level of hypoxia, subordinate fish were unable to defend arterial blood O2 content, which fell to approximately half (0.60 ± 0.13 mL O2 g−1 haemoglobin, N = 9) that of dominant fish (1.08 ± 0.09 mL O2 g−1 haemoglobin, N = 9).

Noradrenaline (NA) treatment (0.4–0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) induced a pronounced elevation in oxygen consumption compared to controls (saline), and the increase in oxygen consumption following injection of NA was 1.8-fold higher in winter compared to summer. This suggests that the smaller members of Afrotheria possess functional brown adipose tissue, which changes in thermogenic capacity depending on the season. Torpor was recorded in both seasons, but in winter the incidence of torpor was higher (n = 205 out of 448 observations) and minimal Tb during torpor was lower (Tbmin: 11.9°C) than in summer (n = 24 out of 674 observations; Tbmin: 26°C).

These rhythms are controlled by a multi-clock system. A principal clock located in the brain usually organizes the overall behavioral rhythms, so that it is called the “central clock”. However, the rhythms observed in a variety of peripheral tissues are often driven by clocks that reside in those tissues. Such autonomous rhythms can be found in sensory organs, digestive and reproductive systems. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, researchers have revealed that the peripheral clocks are self-sustained oscillators with a molecular machinery slightly different from that of the central clock. However, individual clocks normally run in harmony with each other to keep a coordinated temporal structure within an animal. How can this be achieved? What is the molecular mechanism underlying the oscillation? Also how are the peripheral clocks entrained by light–dark cycles? There are still many questions remaining in this research field. In the last several years, molecular techniques have become available in non-model insects so that the molecular oscillatory mechanisms are comparatively investigated among different insects, which give us more hints to understand the essential regulatory mechanism of the multi-oscillatory system across insects and other arthropods.

We assessed the relative contributions of diet and physiological constraints in determining the yolk FA composition of a marine bird, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) by comparing FA signatures of yolks and prey between a captive, controlled- feeding experiment and a wild population. Captive and wild yolk FA signatures differed even though both groups’ yolk lipids were composed primarily of three FA (16:0, 18:0 and 18:1n-9). Differences were due to FA occurring in relatively low abundance, but which mirrored differences in the FA composition of diets. However, yolk FA signatures were correlated across three penguin species suggesting that common developmental constraints can be relatively more important than species-specific differences in diet or egg-laying physiology. While yolk FA are constrained, several minor components of yolk FA are reflective of diets and the calibration coefficients resulting from this study have the potential to be incorporated into predictive models and allow for quantitative dietary and trophic studies using FA analysis of penguin egg yolks.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Exposure to increased temperatures places fish under respiratory stress and increases the likelihood of protein misfolding and degradation that could eventually lead to cell death. Previously, we showed that genes associated with the cellular stress response, apoptosis and hematopoiesis are upregulated in the red blood cells (RBCs) of rainbow trout post-thermal stress, leading to the hypothesis that a tightly regulated interaction between cell repair and cell death is occurring after heat stress. To test this hypothesis, we tracked changes in age class composition and markers of apoptosis in circulating RBCs within individual trout during exposure to and recovery from acute thermal stress. RBCs did not show any indication of apoptosis or necrosis following acute heat stress; however, we observed significant increases in numbers of early, juvenile and dividing RBCs. We also observed a shift in the composition of the circulating RBCs towards a younger cohort following heat shock through release of stored cells from the spleen and an increase in the maturation rate of early RBCs. These results suggest that the genes activated by increased temperature provided sufficient protection against thermal stress in the RBC, subsequently preventing the triggering of the cell death cascade.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Residents of leaf shelters were shown to respond to low amplitude vibrations generated by a crawling conspecific intruder, since removal of the vibrations through leaf incision prevented the resident’s response. Residents did not respond to large amplitude, low frequency disturbances caused by wind and rain alone, but did respond to approaching conspecifics under windy conditions, indicating an ability to discriminate between these sources. Residents also responded differently in the presence of vibrations generated by approaching predators (Podisus) and conspecifics. An analysis of vibration characteristics suggests that despite significant overlap between vibrations from different sources, there are differences in frequency and amplitude characteristics that caterpillars may use to discriminate between sources.

These experiments utilized custom, interactive playback software that effectively engaged subjects in antiphonal calling using vocalizations produced by a single individual and presented ‘probe’ vocalization stimuli representing a different individual at specific points within bouts of calling. The aim here was to test whether marmosets would recognize that the probe stimulus was a phee call produced by a different individual. Data indicated that marmosets were able to detect the change in caller identity; subjects produced significantly fewer antiphonal call responses to probe than control stimuli and, in some conditions, exhibited a shorter latency to produce the vocal response.

Egg volume changed immediately, increasing from 2.8 × 105 μm3 at full strength salinity (35 psu) to 3.8 × 105 μm3 at 0 psu and back to its initial volume when gradually being returned to full strength salinity. Egg osmolality followed the molality of the surrounding water when challenged within a salinity range from 2 to 50 psu.

These results suggest that eggs are unable to regulate their volume or osmolality when challenged with changes in salinity.

In contrast, extreme hyper-saline conditions (76 psu) made the eggs implode and killed the embryo. We propose that the embryo is protected from salinity stress by its plasma membrane and that water exchange driven by osmosis is restricted to the perivitelline space of the egg, which acts as a perfect osmometer in the salinity range of 5–35 psu. We hypothesize further that the embryo is able to keep its volume and osmolality constant due to the impermeability of the inner plasma membrane of the egg or by a combination of osmoregulation and reduced permeability of the inner plasma membrane.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

As temperature decreased from 33 to 15°C, the excitability of all neurons decreased. However, hamster rapid-onset spiking neurons had the highest spiking response and shortest action potential width at every temperature, while hamster delayed-onset spiking neurons had the most negative resting membrane potential. The frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in both phenotypes decreased as temperature decreased, yet the amplitudes of tractus solitarius stimulation-evoked currents were greater in hamsters than in rats regardless of phenotype and temperature. Changes were significant (P < 0.05), supporting our hypothesis by showing that, as temperature falls, rapid-onset neurons contribute more to signal processing but less to energy conservation than do delayed-onset neurons.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This is accompanied by a shift in their pheromonal bouquet, which becomes more queen like. Workers of the Asian hive bee Apis cerana show unusually high levels of ovary activation and this can be interpreted as evidence for a recent evolutionary arms race between queens and workers over worker reproduction in this species. To further explore this, we compared the rate of pheromonal bouquet change between two honeybee sister species of Apis cerana and Apis mellifera under queenright and queenless conditions. We show that in both species, the pheromonal components HOB, 9-ODA, HVA, 9-HDA, 10-HDAA and 10-HDA have significantly higher amounts in laying workers than in non-laying workers. In the queenright colonies of A. mellifera and A. cerana, the ratios (9-ODA)/(9-ODA + 9-HDA + 10-HDAA + 10-HDA) are not significantly different between the two species, but in queenless A. cerana colonies the ratio is significant higher than in A. mellifera, suggesting that in A. cerana, the workers’ pheromonal bouquet is dominated by the queen compound, 9-ODA. The amount of 9-ODA in laying A. cerana workers increased by over 585% compared with the non-laying workers, that is 6.75 times higher than in A. mellifera where laying workers only had 86% more 9-ODA compared with non-laying workers.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

As a consequence, females are the more selective sex and exert a sexual selection on males by responding to the songs of certain conspecific males while rejecting others. What kind of information about the sender may a female obtain from a male’s song, in addition to its species identity? We searched for correlations between a series of song features and morphometric parameters of individual males. In addition, also the immunocompetence of males was assessed by implanting small pieces of nylon thread. We found significant, positive correlations between certain song characteristics and indicators of male size and immunocompetence. Thus, grasshopper females may—in principle—be able to judge a male’s condition and health from the acoustic signals he produces.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

For wild populations of D. melanogaster, it is not clear whether larvae acquire similar or different energy metabolites for desiccation and starvation resistance. We tested the hypothesis whether larval acquisition of energy metabolites is consistent with divergence of desiccation and starvation resistance in darker and lighter isofemale lines of D. melanogaster. Our results are interesting in several respects. First, we found contrasting patterns of larval resource acquisition, i.e., accumulation of higher carbohydrates during 3rd instar larval stage of darker flies versus higher levels of triglycerides in 1st and 2nd larval instars of lighter flies. Second, 3rd instar larvae of darker flies showed ~40 h longer duration of development at 21°C; and greater accumulation of carbohydrates (trehalose and glycogen) in fed larvae as compared with larvae non-fed after 150 h of egg laying. Third, darker isofemale lines have shown significant increase in total water content (18%); hemolymph (86%) and dehydration tolerance (11%) as compared to lighter isofemale lines. Loss of hemolymph water under desiccation stress until death was significantly higher in darker as compared to lighter isofemale lines but tissue water loss was similar. Fourth, for larvae of darker flies, about 65% energy content is contributed by carbohydrates for conferring greater desiccation resistance while the larvae of lighter flies acquire 2/3 energy from lipids for sustaining starvation resistance; and such energy differences persist in the newly eclosed flies. Thus, larval stages of wild-caught darker and lighter flies have evolved independent physiological processes for the accumulation of energy metabolites to cope with desiccation or starvation stress.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Much is known about control mechanisms and functions of each of these substances, yet their interactive effects are not well understood. Here we examine possible additive, multiplicative, and interactive effects of testosterone and carotenoids on female endocrine physiology, immunocompetence, and investment in eggs by simultaneously manipulating levels of testosterone [via gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) challenges] and carotenoids (via diet supplementation) in captive female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Females were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: carotenoid supplementation, GnRH challenge, GnRH challenge + carotenoid supplementation, or control. Carotenoid supplementation significantly increased circulating plasma carotenoid levels and acquired immune system performance, but not innate immunity. GnRH challenges elevated circulating testosterone and carotenoid levels, and induced immunosuppression in females. However, females in the GnRH challenge + carotenoid supplementation treatment had higher cell-mediated immune responses than control females and similar responses to those of carotenoid-supplemented females. Hence, availability of carotenoids in female quail seemed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of GnRH challenges. Our results provide further evidence for synergistic effects of carotenoids and testosterone on endocrine physiology and immune function in female birds. Elevated plasma testosterone or carotenoids levels resulted in increased deposition of those compounds to eggs, respectively. Furthermore, because we found that concentrations of testosterone and carotenoids in yolks were correlated within each treatment group, differential deposition of hormones and carotenoids in eggs may not only respond to surrounding social and environmental conditions, but also to other components of the egg.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False
