Limited audiometric data and certain anatomical features suggest that these seals may have reduced sensitivity to airborne sounds compared to related species. Here, we describe the in-air hearing abilities of a Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) trained to participate in a psychophysical paradigm. We report absolute (unmasked) thresholds for narrowband signals measured in quiet conditions across the range of hearing and masked thresholds measured in the presence of octave-band noise at two frequencies. The behavioral audiogram indicates a functional hearing range from 0.1 to 33 kHz and poor sensitivity, with detection thresholds above 40 dB re 20 µPa. Critical ratio measurements are elevated compared to those of other seals. The apparently reduced terrestrial hearing ability of this individual—considered with available auditory data for a northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris)—suggests that hearing in Monachinae seals differs from that of the highly sensitive Phocinae seals. Exploration of phylogenetic relationships and anatomical traits support this claim. This work advances understanding of the evolution of hearing in amphibious marine mammals and provides updated information that can be used for management and conservation of endangered Hawaiian monk seals.

We compared the effects of specific lesions to the connectives of the abdominal ganglion chain on calling song activity in four different species of crickets, generating very different pulse patterns in their calling songs. In all species, singing activity was abolished after the connectives between the metathoracic ganglion complex and the first abdominal ganglion A3 were severed. The song structure was lost and males generated only single sound pulses when connectives between A3 and A4 were cut. Severing connectives between A4 and A5 had no effect in the trilling species, it led to an extension of chirps in a chirping species and to a loss of the phrase structure in two Teleogryllus species. Cutting the connectives between A5 and A6 caused no or minor changes in singing activity. In spite of the species-specific pulse patterns of calling songs, our data indicate a conserved organisation of the calling song motor pattern generating network. The generation of pulses is controlled by ganglia A3 and A4 while A4 and A5 provide the timing information for the chirp and/or phrase structure of the song.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Either the active metabolic rate (AMR) and critical swimming speed (Ucrit) (30 individuals) or critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) and loss of equilibrium (LOE) (30 individuals) were measured in each species after measuring the resting metabolic rate (RMR). Both the AMR and Ucrit were found to be significantly and positively correlated with the RMR in all three cyprinid species, indicating that high-RMR individuals have high aerobic capacity and thus good swimming performance. Pcrit was positively correlated with the RMR in all three species, whereas the LOE was highly positively correlated, weakly positively correlated and not correlated with the RMR in qingbo, common carp and crucian carp, respectively, possibly due to specialized morphological and biochemical adaptations involved in hypoxia tolerance in crucian and common carp. Crucian carp showed relatively poor swimming performance, i.e., a low Ucrit (relatively high variation), strong hypoxia tolerance, and low LOE (relatively low variation); qingbo showed relatively good swimming performance (relatively low variation) and weak hypoxia tolerance (relatively high variation); and common carp showed moderate swimming performance and relatively strong hypoxia tolerance (moderate variation). These interspecific differences may be due to the different lifestyles of these cyprinid fishes based on their associated fast-slow-flow regime and are outcomes of long-term selection.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

These different behavioral phenotypes can expose animals to distinct cognitive challenges, which may be addressed through neuroanatomical differentiation. The dramatic phenotypic plasticity underlying ARTs provides a powerful opportunity to study how intraspecific nervous system variation can support distinct cognitive abilities. We hypothesized that conspecific animals pursuing ARTs would exhibit dissimilar brain architecture. Dimorphic males of the bee species Centris pallida and Amegilla dawsoni use alternative mate location strategies that rely primarily on either olfaction (large-morph) or vision (small-morph) to find females. This variation in behavior led us to predict increased volumes of the brain regions supporting their primarily chemosensory or visual mate location strategies. Large-morph males relying mainly on olfaction had relatively larger antennal lobes and relatively smaller optic lobes than small-morph males relying primarily on visual cues. In both species, as relative volumes of the optic lobe increased, the relative volume of the antennal lobe decreased. In addition, A. dawsoni large males had relatively larger mushroom body lips, which process olfactory inputs. Our results suggest that the divergent behavioral strategies in ART systems can be associated with neuroanatomical differentiation.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

In this study, we examined the effects of these contrasting environments on the dominant bacteria in the guts of the amphibious mudskipper Boleophthalmus pectinirostris. Compared with the guts of normal mudskippers, in which the dominant bacteria were identified as Vibrio and Faecalibacterium, we found that Acinetobacter, Shigella, and Bacillus predominated in their guts after exposure to the semi-aquatic environment, whereas Escherichia, Bacteroides, and Bacillus were more prevalent in the guts in the underwater environment. The total number of cultured gut bacteria decreased significantly in the semi-aquatic environment. In semi-aquatic mudskippers, we also detected reductions and increases in the length and width of gut villi, respectively, whereas the width of gut villi declined and the number of goblet cells increased significantly in mudskippers maintained underwater. The mRNA expression of multiple gut transporters for glucose, long-chain fatty acids, and amino acids was found to increase markedly in both underwater and semi-aquatic environments, with the expression of most transporters being significantly higher in those mudskippers exposed to an underwater environment. Furthermore, we detected significant increases in the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts in the guts of both underwater and semi-aquatic mudskippers on days 2, 4, and 6 of exposure, whereas the expression of IL-10 and TGFβ mRNA was more pronounced on days 4 and 8, respectively. Comparatively, we found that expression levels of cytokines in the guts of underwater mudskipper were substantially higher than those in the guts of semi-aquatic mudskippers. Collectively, our findings revealed notable differences in the gut microbiota and energy metabolism requirements of mudskippers exposed to underwater and semi-aquatic conditions, thereby providing a theoretical basis explaining the maintenance of a homeostatic state in mudskippers that constantly transition between these contrasting amphibious habitats.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Here, we characterized the development of the O2-sensing system in the mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), an amphibious fish that transitions between hypoxic aquatic environments and O2-rich terrestrial environments. We found that NECs formed in the gills and skin of K. marmoratus during embryonic development and that both NEC populations are retained from the embryonic stage to adulthood. We also found that the hyperventilatory response to acute hypoxia was present in embryonic K. marmoratus, indicating that functional O2-sensing pathways are formed during embryonic development. We then exposed embryos to aquatic normoxia, aquatic hyperoxia, aquatic hypoxia, or terrestrial conditions for the first 30 days of embryonic development and tested the hypothesis that environmental O2 availability during embryonic development modulates the development of the O2-sensing system in amphibious fishes. Surprisingly, we found that O2 availability during embryonic development had little impact on the density and morphology of NECs in the gills and skin of K. marmoratus. Collectively, our results demonstrate that, unlike the only other species of fish in which NEC development has been studied to date (i.e., zebrafish), NEC development in K. marmoratus is largely unaffected by environmental O2 levels during the embryonic stage, indicating that there is interspecies variation in O2-induced plasticity in the O2-sensing system of fishes.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The thickness of cortical and trabecular bone was decreased in femur of hindlimb unloaded rats, while it was maintained in femur of hibernating ground squirrels. Interestingly, the ultimate bending energy and ultimate normalized displacement were reduced and the bending rigidity was increased in tibia of hibernating ground squirrels. Besides, the protein level of Runx2 was decreased in femur and tibia of unloaded rats, while it was maintained in tibia and even increased in femur of hibernating ground squirrels. The protein levels of RANKL and MMP-9 were increased in femur and tibia in unloaded rats, while they were maintained in both femur and tibia of hibernating ground squirrels. The protein level of GSK-3β was increased in femur and tibia of unloaded rats, while it was maintained in both femur and tibia of hibernating ground squirrels. The phospho-β-catenin expression was increased in both femur and tibia of unloaded rats, while it was only decreased in femur, but maintained in tibia of hibernating ground squirrels. In conclusion, the femur and tibia in hindlimb unloaded rats showed obvious bone loss, while they mitigated disuse-induced bone loss in hibernating ground squirrels, involving differential protein expression of key molecules in bone remodeling. In comparison with hindlimb unloaded rats, promoting osteoblast differentiation through activating canonical GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling involving Runx2 might be an adaptation to natural disuse in femur of hibernating Daurian ground squirrels. However, there was no statistical change in the protein levels of bone formation related proteins, GSK-3β and phospho-β-catenin in tibia of hibernating Daurian ground squirrels.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The lipid-rich tissues (blubber, acoustic, neural) are of particular concern as N2 is five times more soluble in lipid than in blood or muscle, creating body compartments that can become N2 saturated, possibly leading to gas emboli upon surfacing. We characterized lipids in the neural tissues of marine mammals to determine whether they have similar lipid profiles compared to terrestrial mammals. Lipid profiles (lipid content, lipid class composition, and fatty acid signatures) were determined in the neural tissues of 12 cetacean species with varying diving regimes, and compared to two species of terrestrial mammals. Neural tissue lipid profile was not significantly different in marine versus terrestrial mammals across tissue types. Within the marine species, average dive depth was not significantly associated with the lipid profile of cervical spinal cord. Across species, tissue type (brain, spinal cord, and spinal nerve) was a significant factor in lipid profile, largely due to the presence of storage lipids (triacylglycerol and wax ester/sterol ester) in spinal nerve tissue only. The stability of lipid signatures within the neural tissue types of terrestrial and marine species, which display markedly different dive behaviors, points to the consistent role of lipids in these tissues. These findings indicate that despite large differences in the level of N2 gas exposure by dive type in the species examined, the lipids of neural tissues likely do not have a neuroprotective role in marine mammals.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

He established the honeybee as a key animal model for experimental behavioural studies on sensory perception, learning and memory, and first correctly interpreted its famous dance communication. Here, we report on a previously unknown letter by the Physicist and Nobel Laureate Albert Einstein that was written in October 1949. It briefly addresses the work of von Frisch and also queries how understanding animal perception and navigation may lead to innovations in physics. We discuss records proving that Einstein and von Frisch met in April 1949 when von Frisch visited the USA to present a lecture on bees at Princeton University. In the historical context of Einstein’s theories and thought experiments, we discuss some more recent discoveries of animal sensory capabilities alien to us humans and potentially valuable for bio-inspired design improvements. We also address the orientation of animals like migratory birds mentioned by Einstein 70 years ago, which pushes the boundaries of our understanding nature, both its biology and physics.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

We studied two root-rat species to see if their ear morphology reflects the difference in the amount of their surface activity. Whereas the more subterranean Tachyoryctes splendens possesses shorter pinnae as expected, it has smaller bullae compared to the more epigeic Tachyoryctes macrocephalus. The ratio between the eardrum and the stapedial footplate area and the ratio between the mallear and the incudal lever were lower in T. splendens (19.3 ± 0.3 and 1.9 ± 0.0, respectively) than in T. macrocephalus (21.8 ± 0.6 and 2.1 ± 0.1), probably reflecting the latter's higher surface activity. The cochlea in both species has 3.5 coils, yet the basilar membrane is longer in the smaller T. splendens (13.0 ± 0.5 versus 11.4 ± 0.7 mm), which indicates its wider hearing range and/or higher sensitivity (to some frequencies). In both root-rat species, the highest density of outer hair cells (OHC) was in the apical part of the cochlea, while the highest density of inner hair cells (IHC) was in its middle part. This OHC density pattern corresponds with good low-frequency hearing, whereas the IHC pattern suggests sensitivity to higher frequencies.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Oreochromis niloticus were bred in individual and group cultures. The scaling exponent of the RMR in the individual cultures was b = 0.620-0.821 (n = 30) and that in the group culture was b = 0.770 [natural logarithm (ln) RMR = 0.770 ln M - 1.107 (n = 76)]. The results of the two experimental methods were similar and were not significantly different from 0.75 (3/4), as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology. The active and inactive organs were scaled with body mass by an exponent of 0.940 and 1.012, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the blood parameters and body mass. These results suggest that the differences in the culture methods may not have affected the allometric scaling of O. niloticus metabolism. The proportion of active and inactive organs contributed to allometric changes in the metabolic rate with body mass. Red blood cells in fish are not generally representative, and cell size can only partially explain the allometric scaling of metabolism.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Larger animals are more likely to win with their physical advantage, but they are frequently beaten by small dominant animals with previous winning experience. This winner effect remains for several days. In mammals, anxiety impairs learning and induces memory forgetting. In this study, dominant crayfish were exposed to electrical shocks two days after their first win, after which they were paired with large or small naive opponents the following day. Our results showed that electrical shock-applied dominant animals were beaten by large naive opponents, but overcame small naive opponents, suggesting that electrical shocks cause animals to forget their previous winner effect. Electrical shocks appeared to elicit serotonin-mediated anxiety since electrical shocks had no effect on mianserin-injected dominant animals. A 0.5 µM serotonin injection induced a caused anxiety-like reaction, while a 1.0 µM serotonin injection-induced no changes in posture and walking activity. For pairings between dominant and naive animals 1 day after serotonin injection, 0.5 µM serotonin caused similar forgetting of the winner effect, but 1.0 µM serotonin had no effect. Serotonin of low concentrations mediated anxiety and stimulated forgetting of the winner's memory.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Bumetanide (0.005-0.1 mmol l-1 carotid plasma) progressively reduced mid-range flow by 52 ± 3.4% (mean ± SEM). Concurrently, saliva [Cl] decreased, [Na] and [HCO3] increased but HCO3 excretion was unaltered. Salivary flow during high-rate cholinergic stimulation was 31 ± 1.1% of the pre-bumetanide maximum. During mid-range stimulation, SITS (0.075 mmol l-1) was without effect whereas 0.75 mmol l-1 stimulated transient increases in fluid output. The higher SITS concentration caused no alterations to flow or electrolyte concentrations during maximal stimulation. Carotid plasma [amiloride] (0.05 mmol l-1) caused immediate falls in flow rate of 20-30% followed by progressive recovery over 25 min to levels above pre-amiloride flow rates despite plasma [amiloride] increasing tenfold. Concurrently, salivary [Na] and [Cl] rose to equal plasma concentrations and [K] fell by 50% indicating blockade of acinar Na/H exchangers and luminal Na channels in the ducts. Increased salivary osmolarity caused the flow recovery. Saliva flow during maximum cholinergic stimulation was reduced by 38-46%. The depression of flow was interpreted as resulting from competition between amiloride and acetylcholine for access to the muscarinic receptors. Plasma [acetazolamide] (0.35-2.5 mmol l-1) did not alter saliva outflow during mid-range or maximum flow regimes whereas salivary [Cl] increased and [HCO3] decreased consistent with reduced anion exchange resulting from inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Combined with bumetanide, acetazolamide (1.5 mmol l-1) reduced flow by an additional 18-22% relative to bumetanide alone thereby demonstrating that acinar HCO3 synthesis supported a limited proportion of saliva formation and that some HCO3 secretion was independent of carbonic anhydrase activity.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The present study aimed to examine whether ploidy levels cause differences in cell surface area (SA), MR and metabolic scaling. The resting MR (RMR), red blood cell SA (SARBC), red blood cell count (RBCC), gill SA (GSA), and ventilation frequency (VF) were measured in diploid and triploid common carp with different body masses (M). The results showed that both M and ploidy level affected the RMR, GSA, VF, and SARBC, with interactions between M and ploidy level. The triploids had larger SARBC but lower RBCC than those of the diploids. The SARBC increased weakly but significantly with increasing M, by an exponent of 0.043, in the triploids but did not increase in the diploids. The RMR of the triploids and diploids scaled with M, by exponents of 0.696 and 1.007, respectively. The RMR was higher in the triploids than the diploids. The GSA scaled with M, with an exponent of 0.906 in the triploids and an exponent of 1.043 in the diploids. The VF scaled with M by an exponent of - 0.305 in the triploids but showed no correlation with M in the diploids. The larger SARBC and RMR and smaller scaling exponents of both the GSA and VF of the triploids were consistent with the finding that the bR was smaller in the triploids than in the diploids. This suggests that the ploidy-induced changes of SA and SA scaling affect the metabolic scaling of fish.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Ascending interneurones originating in the terminal ganglion receive sensory inputs from the tailfan and they affect spike activity of both uropod and abdominal postural motor neurones, which coordinates the uropod and abdominal postural movements. Despite the varying output effects of ascending interneurones, the synaptic responses of all interneurones to sensory stimulation were enhanced when they acquired a dominant state. The number of spikes increased as did a sustained membrane depolarizations. Regardless of social status, the output effects on the uropod motor neurones of all interneurones except VE-1 remained unchanged. VE-1 mainly inhibited the uropod opener motor neurones in naive animals, but tended to excite them in dominant animals. Synaptic enhancement of the sensory response of ascending interneurones was also observed in naive animals treated with bath-applied serotonin. However, subordinate animals or naive animals treated with octopamine had no noticeable effect on the synaptic response of their ascending interneurones to sensory stimulation. Thus, enhancement of the synaptic response is a specific neural event that occurs when crayfish attain social dominance and it is mediated by serotonin.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The weakly electric black ghost knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons, is typically found in well-oxygenated freshwater habitats in South America. Using a shuttle-box design, we exposed juvenile A. albifrons to a stepwise decline in DO from normoxia (> 95% air saturation) to extreme hypoxia (10% air saturation) in one compartment and chronic normoxia in the other. On average, A. albifrons actively avoided the hypoxic compartment below 22% air saturation. Hypoxia avoidance was correlated with upregulated swimming activity. Following avoidance, fish regularly ventured back briefly into deep hypoxia. Hypoxia did not affect the frequency of their electric organ discharges. Our results show that A. albifrons is able to sense hypoxia at non-lethal levels and uses active avoidance to mitigate its adverse effects.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Arachnids are one of the oldest lineages of terrestrial animals and characterized by an octopodal locomotor apparatus with hydraulic limb extension. Their locomotion repertoire includes running, climbing, jumping, but also swimming, diving, abseiling, rolling, gliding and -passively- even flying. Studying the unique locomotor functions and movement ecology of arachnids is important for an integrative understanding of the ecology and evolution of this diverse and ubiquitous animal group. Beyond biology, arachnid locomotion is inspiring robotic engineers. The aim of this special issue is to display the state of the interdisciplinary research on arachnid locomotion, linking physiology and biomechanics with ecology, ethology and evolutionary biology. It comprises five reviews and ten original research reports covering diverse topics, ranging from the neurophysiology of arachnid movement, the allometry and sexual dimorphism of running kinematics, the effect of autotomy or heavy body parts on locomotor efficiency, and the evolution of silk-spinning choreography, to the biophysics of ballooning and ballistic webs. This closes a significant gap in the literature on animal biomechanics.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology. A, Neuroethology, sensory, neural, and behavioral physiology",False

Nevertheless, a decrease in mean particle size (MPS) along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has been reported, especially in hindgut fermenters. However, to what degree the very fine particle fraction (non-food origin, especially microbes) affects MPS is unclear. Fat sand rats ( Psammomys obesus , diurnal herbivores, n  = 23, 175 ± sd 24 g) consumed one of four chenopods (natural dietary items in the wild) for 30 days. Digestibility was related negatively to dietary fibre content. We determined digesta MPS in the forestomach, glandular stomach, small intestine, caecum, colon and faeces by wet sieving, including (MPS fines ) or excluding (MPS nofines ) particles < 0.25 mm. The proportions of fines were higher and of MPS fines were correspondingly lower in GIT sections that harbour microbes (forestomach, hindgut), whereas MPS nofines did not differ between forestomach and glandular stomach. However, MPS nofines decreased along the GIT, indicating MPS reduction due to digestive (enzymatic and microbial) processes. The four different diets led to different MPS, but the magnitude of MPS reduction in the GIT was not correlated with dietary fibre fractions or dry matter digestibility. These results indicate that within a species, MPS cannot be used as a proxy for diet quality or digestibility, and raise the hypothesis that MPS reduction along the GIT may be more pronounced in smaller than in larger mammalian terrestrial herbivores, possibly due to the fine initial particles produced by chewing in small species.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Here, we investigate how jumping spiders (Pseudeuophrys lanigera and Sitticus pubescens) avoid slipping when accelerating. Both species differed in the relative contribution of leg pairs to the jump. P. lanigera accelerated mainly with their long third legs, whereas their short fourth legs detached earlier. In contrast, S. pubescens accelerated mainly with their long fourth legs, and their short third legs detached earlier. Because of the different orientation (fourth-leg tip pointing backward, third-leg tip pointing forward), the fourth-leg tarsus pushed, whereas the third-leg tarsus pulled. High-speed video recordings showed that pushing and pulling was achieved by different attachment structures. In P. lanigera, third-leg feet made surface contact with setae on their distal or lateral claw tuft, whereas fourth-leg feet engaged the proximal claw tuft, and the distal tuft was raised off the ground. S. pubescens showed the same division of labour between proximal and distal claw tuft for pushing and pulling, but the claw tuft contact lasted longer and was more visible in the fourth than in the third legs. Experimental ablation of claw tufts caused accelerating spiders to slip, confirming that adhesion is essential for jumps from smooth substrates.

We hypothesized that alterations in protein metabolism contribute to the reduced growth rate of socially stressed trout, and predicted that subordinate trout would exhibit reduced rates of protein synthesis coupled with increases in protein degradation. Protein metabolism was assessed in dominant and subordinate fish after 4 days of social interaction, and in fish that were separated after 4 days of interaction for a 4 days recovery period, to determine whether effects on protein metabolism recovered when social stress was alleviated. Protein metabolism was assessed in liver and white muscle by measuring the fractional rate of protein synthesis and markers of protein degradation. In the white muscle of subordinate fish, protein synthesis was inhibited and activities of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and the autophagy lysosomal system (ALS) were elevated. By contrast, the liver of subordinate fish exhibited increased rates of protein synthesis and activation of the ALS. When allowed to recover from chronic social stress for 4 days, differences in protein metabolism observed in white muscle of subordinate fish during the interaction period disappeared. In liver, protein synthesis returned to baseline levels during recovery from social stress, but markers of protein degradation did not. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that inhibition of muscle protein synthesis coupled with increases in muscle protein breakdown contribute to the reduced growth rates of subordinate rainbow trout.

Nevertheless, hibernating animals—who endure lengthy periods of immobility—do not show signs of thrombosis throughout or after hibernation. One of the adaptations of hemostasis in hibernators consists of a rapidly reversible reduction of the number of circulating platelets during torpor, i.e., the hibernation phase with reduction of metabolic rate, low blood flow and immobility. It is unknown whether these platelet dynamics in hibernating hamsters originate from storage and release, as suggested for ground squirrel, or from breakdown and de novo synthesis. A reduction in detaching forces due to low blood flow can induce reversible adhesion of platelets to the vessel wall, which is called margination. Here, we hypothesized that storage-and-release by margination to the vessel wall induces reversible thrombocytopenia in torpor. Therefore, we transfused labeled platelets in hibernating Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and platelets were analyzed using flow cytometry and electron microscopy. The half-life of labeled platelets was extended from 20 to 30 h in hibernating animals compared to non-hibernating control hamsters. More than 90% of labeled platelets were cleared from the circulation during torpor, followed by emergence during arousal which supports storage-and-release to govern thrombocytopenia in torpor. Furthermore, the low number of immature platelets, plasma level of interleukin-1α and normal numbers of megakaryocytes in bone marrow make platelet synthesis or megakaryocyte rupture via interleukin-1α unlikely to account for the recovery of platelet counts upon arousal. Finally, using large-scale electron microscopy we revealed platelets to accumulate in liver sinusoids, but not in spleen or lung, during torpor. These results thus demonstrate that platelet dynamics in hibernation are caused by storage and release of platelets, most likely by margination to the vessel wall in liver sinusoids. Translating the molecular mechanisms that govern platelet retention in the liver, may be of major relevance for hemostatic management in (accidental) hypothermia and for the development of novel anti-thrombotic strategies.

The majority of studies have investigated how adaptative variation in thermal physiology is correlated with broad-scale climate, but the role of fine-scale microclimate remains less clear . We hypothesised that the heat tolerance limits and evaporative cooling capacity of desert rodents are correlated with microclimates within species-specific diurnal refugia. We tested predictions arising from this hypothesis by comparing thermoregulation in the heat among arboreal black-tailed tree rats (Thallomys nigricauda), Namaqua rock rats (Micaelamys namaquensis) and hairy-footed gerbils (Gerbillurus paeba). Species and populations that occupy hotter diurnal microsites tolerated air temperatures (Ta) ~ 2-4 ℃ higher compared to those species occupying cooler, more thermally buffered microsites. Inter- and intraspecific variation in heat tolerance was attributable to ~ 30% greater evaporative water loss and ~ 44 % lower resting metabolic rates at high Ta, respectively. Our results suggest that microclimates within rodent diurnal refugia are an important correlate of intra- and interspecific physiological variation and reiterate the need to incorporate fine-scale microclimatic conditions when investigating adaptative variation in thermal physiology.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Although cell morphology rhythms in mammals have been reported, they have scarcely been investigated in fish. The aim of the present research was to investigate the existence of daily rhythms in the morphology of cells in the liver and intestine of a teleost fish, the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and how feeding time influences them. Regarding liver, we also focused on differences between the two metabolic zones: perivenous and periportal. For this purpose, fish were divided into two groups: fish fed once a day in the mid-light phase (ML) or the mid-dark phase (MD). After 1 month under each feeding regime, liver and intestine samples were collected every 4 h during a 24-h cycle, and different parameters were studied by light microscopy and image analysis. Daily rhythms occurred in most of the parameters evaluated in the liver. The effect of feeding time depended on the metabolic zone: the rhythms in the periportal zone were synchronized mainly by the light/dark cycle regardless of feeding time, whereas in the perivenous zone, rhythms were influenced more by feeding time. In the intestine, a daily rhythm in villi height was found with acrophases coinciding with feeding time in each group. These findings show for the first time the existence of cellular morphological rhythms in fish liver and intestine, and highlight the interactions between light and feeding cycles in the different metabolic zones of the liver.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Semi-terrestrial crustaceans such as Helice formosensis mitigate these physiological consequences by modifying and recycling urine and branchial water shifting some branchial workload to the antennal glands. To investigate how this process occurs, Helice formosensis were emersed for up to 160 h and their hemolymph and urinary acid-base, nitrogenous waste, free amino acids, and osmoregulatory parameters were investigated. Upon emersion, crabs experienced a respiratory acidosis that is restored by bicarbonate accumulation and ammonia reduction within the hemolymph and urine after 24 h. Prolonged emersion caused an overcompensatory metabolic alkalosis potentially limiting the crab's ability to remain emersed. During the alkalosis, hemolymph ammonia was maintained at control levels while urinary ammonia remained reduced by 60% of control values. During emersion, ammonia may be temporarily converted to alanine as part of the Cahill cycle until re-immersion where crabs can revert alanine to ammonia for excretion coinciding with the crabs' observed delayed ammonia excretion response. The presence of high hemolymph alanine concentrations even when immersed may indicate this cycle's use outside of emersion or in preparation for emersion. Furthermore, H. formosensis appears to be uniquely capable of actively suppressing its rate of desiccation in absence of behavioral changes, in part by creating hyperosmotic urine that mitigates evaporative water loss.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Honeybee colonies behave like ‘superorganisms’ where individuals work together to promote reproduction of the colony. Social cooperation has developed strongly in thermal homeostasis, which guarantees a fast and constant development of the brood. We here report on the cooperation of individuals in reaction to environmental variation to achieve thermal constancy of 34–36 °C. The measurement of body temperature together with bee density and in-hive microclimate showed that behaviours for hive heating or cooling are strongly interlaced and differ in their start values. When environmental temperature changes, heat production is adjusted both by regulation of bee density due to migration activity and by the degree of endothermy. Overheating of the brood is prevented by cooling with water droplets and increased fanning, which start already at moderate temperatures where heat production and bee density are still at an increased level. This interlaced change and onset of different thermoregulatory behaviours guarantees a graded adaptation of individual behaviour to stabilise the temperature of the brood.

There is great interest in whether organisms that experience greater thermal variability can gain metabolic or tolerance advantages through phenotypic plasticity. We compared thermal tolerance and routine aerobic metabolism of Convict cichlid acclimated for 2 weeks to constant 20 °C, constant 30 °C, or a daily cycle of 20 → 30 °C (1.7 °C/h). Acute routine mass-specific oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]O2) and critical thermal maxima/minima (CTMax/CTMin) were compared between groups, with cycle-acclimated fish sampled from the daily minimum (20 °C, 0900 h) and maximum (30 °C, 1600 h). Cycle-acclimated fish demonstrated statistically similar CTMax at the daily minimum and maximum (39.0 °C, 38.6 °C) but distinct CTMin values, with CTMin 2.4 °C higher for fish sampled from the daily 30 °C maximum (14.8 °C) compared to the daily 20 °C minimum (12.4 °C). Measured acutely at 30 °C, [Formula: see text]O2 decreased with increasing acclimation temperature; 20 °C acclimated fish had an 85% higher average [Formula: see text]O2 than 30 °C acclimated fish. Similarly, acute [Formula: see text]O2 at 20 °C was 139% higher in 20 °C acclimated fish compared to 30 °C acclimated fish. Chronic [Formula: see text]O2 was measured in separate fish continually across the 20 → 30 °C daily cycle for all 3 acclimation groups. Chronic [Formula: see text]O2 responses were very similar between groups between average individual hourly values, as temperatures increased or decreased (1.7 °C/h). Acute [Formula: see text]O2 and thermal tolerance responses highlight ""classic"" trends, but dynamic, chronic trials suggest acclimation history has little effect on the relative change in oxygen consumption during a thermal cycle. Our results strongly suggest that the minimum and maximum temperatures experienced more strongly influence fish physiology, rather than the thermal cycle itself. This research highlights the importance of collecting data in both cycling and static (constant) thermal conditions, and further research should seek to understand whether ectotherm metabolism does respond uniquely to fluctuating temperatures.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Despite the survival benefits of immunity in this context, the costs incurred may require investment to be diverted from traits contributing to immediate and/or future survival, such as locomotor performance and oxidative status. Yet, whether trait constraints manifest likely depends on wound severity and the implications for energy budget. For this study, food intake, body mass, sprint speed, and oxidative indices (reactive oxygen metabolites, antioxidant capacity) were monitored in male side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) healing from cutaneous wounds of discrete sizes (control, small, large). Results indicate that larger wounds induced faster healing, reduced food consumption, and led to greater oxidative stress over time. Granted wounding did not differentially affect body mass or sprint speed overall, small-wounded lizards with greater wound area healed had faster sprint speeds while large-wounded lizards with greater wound area healed had slower sprint speeds. During recovery from either wound severity, however, healing and sprint performance did not correspond with food consumption, body mass loss, nor oxidative status. These findings provide support that energy budget, locomotor performance, and oxidative status of a reptile are linked to wound recovery to an extent, albeit dependent on wound severity.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Since ion channel composition and ion currents of the fish AV canal have not been previously studied, we measured major cation currents and transcript expression of ion channels in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) AV tissue. Both ion current densities and expression of ion channel transcripts indicate that the fish AV canal has a characteristic electrophysiological phenotype that differs from those of sinoatrial tissue, atrium and ventricle. Two types of cardiomyocytes were distinguished electrophysiologically in trout AV nodal tissue: the one (transitional cell) is functionally intermediate between working atrial/ventricular myocytes and the other (AV nodal cell) has a less negative resting membrane potential than atrial and ventricular myocytes and is a more similar to the sinoatrial nodal cells in ion channel composition. The AV nodal cells are characterized by a small or non-existent inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), low density of fast sodium current (INa) and relatively high expression of T-type calcium channels (CACNA3.1). Pacemaker channel (HCN4 and HCN2) transcripts were expressed in the AV nodal tissue but If current was not found in enzymatically isolated nodal myocytes. The electrophysiological properties of the rainbow trout nodal cells are appropriate for a slow rate of action potential conduction (small INa) and a moderate propensity for pacemaking activity (absence of IK1).",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

This has generated strong selective pressure on the morphology and function of their digestive system. Given that in bats intestinal length and nominal surface-area are proportional to body mass, this trait importantly relates to explaining some of their digestive characteristics. We described the relationship between digestive traits and body mass of four species of bats of the family Vespertilionidae living in a montane ecosystem in central Mexico. We calculated food transit time, apparent dry matter digestibility, and defecation rate in feeding trials under captive conditions. We also: (1) built a model of the relationship between digestive traits and body mass to determine if this association was consistent within the members of the family Vespertilionidae, and (2) mapped these traits along the phylogeny to explore how digestive characteristics may have evolved. In our feeding trials, body mass was positively related to transit time and negatively related to apparent dry matter digestibility. The model predicted accurately the transit time in bats with body mass < 20 g. The phylogenetic approach suggested that over the evolutionary history of the family, transit time decreased as digestibility increased. Because of the results obtained here, it is likely that for most bats of the family Vespertilionidae, adaptations in digestive traits to process food have followed evolutionary changes in their body mass. We discuss these findings in a physiological and ecological context.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology. B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology",False

Hagfish inhale through a single nostril via a velum pump, and exhale through multiple separate gill pouches. We assessed respiratory performance in E. stoutii (31 ppt, 12 ºC, 50-120 g) by measuring total ventilatory flow ([Formula: see text]) at the nostril, velar (respiratory) frequency (fr), and inspired (PIO2) and expired (PEO2) oxygen tensions at all 12 gill pouch exits plus the pharyngo-cutaneous duct (PCD) on the left side, and calculated ventilatory stroke volume (S[Formula: see text]), % O2 utilization, and oxygen consumption (ṀO2). At rest under normoxia, spontaneous changes in [Formula: see text] ranged from apnea to > 400 ml kg-1 min-1, due to variations in both fr and S[Formula: see text]; ""normal"" [Formula: see text] averaged 137 ml kg-1 min-1, ṀO2 was 718 µmol kg-1 h-1, so the ventilatory convection requirement for O2 was about 11 L mmol-1. Relative to anterior gill pouches, lower PEO2 values (i.e. higher utilization) occurred in the more posterior pouches and PCD. Overall, O2 utilization was 34% and did not change during hyperventilation but increased to > 90% during hypoventilation. Environmental hypoxia (PIO2 ~ 8% air saturation, 1.67 kPa, 13 Torr) caused hyperventilation, but neither acute hyperoxia (PIO2 ~ 275% air saturation, 57.6 kPa, 430 Torr) nor hypercapnia (PICO2 ~ 1% CO2, 1.0 kPa, 7.5 Torr) significantly altered [Formula: see text]. ṀO2 decreased in hypoxia and increased in hyperoxia but did not change in hypercapnia. Acute exposure to high environmental ammonia (HEA, 10 mM NH4HCO3) caused an acute decrease in [Formula: see text], in contrast to the hyperventilation of long-term HEA exposure described in a previous study. The hypoventilatory response to HEA still occurred during hypoxia and hyperoxia, but was blunted during hypercapnia. Under all treatments, ṀO2 increased with increases in [Formula: see text]. Overall, there were lower convection requirements for O2 during hyperoxia, higher requirements during hypoxia and hypercapnia, but unchanged requirements during HEA. We conclude that this ""primitive"" fish operates a flexible respiratory system with considerable reserve capacity.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Here, shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) were subjected to different durations of reduced water salinity from 33 to 15 ppt. Routine metabolic rate decreased after short-term acclimation (4–9 days) to 15 ppt, which corresponded with similar reductions in cardiac output. Likewise, standard metabolic rate decreased after acute transition (3 h) from 33 to 15 ppt, suggesting a reduced energetic cost of osmoregulation at 15 ppt. Interestingly, gut blood flow remained unchanged across salinities, which contrasts with previous findings in freshwater euryhaline teleosts (e.g., rainbow trout) exposed to different salinities. Although plasma osmolality, [Na+], [Cl−] and [Ca2+] decreased in 15 ppt, there were no signs of cellular osmotic stress as plasma [K+], [hemoglobin] and hematocrit remained unchanged. Taken together, our data suggest that shorthorn sculpin are relatively weak plasma osmoregulators that apply a strategy whereby epithelial ion transport mechanisms are partially maintained across salinities, while plasma composition is allowed to fluctuate within certain ranges. This may have energetic benefits in environments where salinity naturally fluctuates, and could provide shorthorn sculpin with competitive advantages if salinity fluctuations intensify with climate change in the future.

Hypoxia can also impede lung development during early post-natal life in some mammals, and could thus accentuate constraints on O2 transport at high altitude. We examined how these challenges are overcome in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude. Lung structure was examined in highland and lowland populations of deer mice and lowland populations of white-footed mice (P. leucopus; a congener restricted to low altitude) that were bred in captivity. Among mice that were born and raised to adulthood in normoxia, highland deer mice had higher alveolar surface density and more densely packed alveoli. The increased alveolar surface density in highlanders became fully apparent at juvenile life stages at post-natal day 30 (P30), after the early developmental period of intense alveolus formation before P21. Alveolar surface density was maintained in highlanders that were conceived, born, and raised in hypoxia (~ 12 kPa O2), suggesting that lung development was not impaired by post-natal hypoxia as it is in many other lowland mammals. However, developmental hypoxia increased lung volume and thus augmented total alveolar surface area from P14. Overall, our findings suggest that evolutionary adaptation and developmental plasticity lead to changes in lung morphology that should improve pulmonary O2 uptake in deer mice native to high altitude.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

If organ growth is proportional (isometric), then the exponent of the scaling equation is 1.0. Relative decreases or increases in size result in exponents less than 1 (hypoallometric) or greater than 1 (hyperallometric). Thus, the empirical exponent can indicate potential changes in function. The entire gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the foregut-fermenting western grey kangaroo Macropus fuliginosus melanops exhibited biphasic allometry across five orders of magnitude body mass (Mb; 52.0 g-70.5 kg). Prior to weaning at around 12 kg Mb, the entire empty GIT mass scaled with hyperallometry (Mb1.13), shifting to hypoallometry (Mb0.80) post-weaning. In addition, there were varying patterns of hyper-, hypo-, and isometric scaling for select GIT organs, with several displaying phase shifts associated with major life-history events, specifically around exit from the maternal pouch and around weaning. Mass of the kangaroo forestomach, the main fermentation site, scaled with hyperallometry (Mb1.16) before the stage of increased vegetation intake, and possibly after this stage (Mb1.12; P = 0.07), accompanied by a higher scaling factor (elevation of the curve) probably associated with more muscle for processing fibrous vegetation. The acid hindstomach mass showed hyperallometry (Mb1.15) before weaning, but hypoallometry (Mb 0.58) post-weaning, presumably associated with decreasing intake of milk. Small intestine mass and length each scaled isometrically throughout ontogeny, with no discernible breakpoints at any life-history stage. The caecum and colon mass were steeply hyperallometric early in-pouch life (Mb1.59-1.66), when the young were ectothermic, hairless, and supported solely by milk. After around 295 g Mb, caecum mass remained hyperallometric (Mb1.14), possibly supporting its early development as a nidus for microbial populations to provide for secondary fermentation in this organ after the young transition from milk to vegetation.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

However, still little is known about silk aside from its molecular structure and material strength. Spiders produce many different silks and even join several silk types to one functional unit. In cribellate spiders, a complex multi-fibre system with up to six different silks affects the adherence to the prey. The assembly of these cribellate capture threads influences the mechanical properties as each fibre type absorbs forces specifically. For the interplay of fibres, spinnerets have to move spatially and come into contact with each other at specific points in time. However, spinneret kinematics are not well described though highly sophisticated movements are performed which are in no way inferior to the movements of other flexible appendages. We describe here the kinematics for the spinnerets involved in the cribellate spinning process of the grey house spider, Badumna longinqua, as an example of spinneret kinematics in general. With this information, we set a basis for understanding spinneret kinematics in other spinning processes of spiders and additionally provide inspiration for biomimetic multiple fibre spinning.

Here, we critically review available literature. In tethered animals , by applying loads to the metatarsus tip , strain and mechanical sensitivity ( S  = strain/load) induced at various sites in the tibia were determined. The loci of the lyriform organs close to the tibia–metatarsus joint did not stand out by high strain. The strains induced at various sites during free locomotion can be interpreted based on S and, beyond the joint region, on beam theory. Spiders avoided laterad loading of the tibia–metatarsus joint during slow locomotion. Balancing body weight, joint flexors caused compressive strain at the posterior and dorsal tibia. While climbing upside down strain measurements indicate strong flexor activity. In future studies, a precise calculation and quantitative determination of strain at the sites of the lyriform organs will profit from more detailed data on the overall strain distribution, morphology, and material properties. The values and caveats of the strain gauge technology, the only one applicable to freely moving spiders, are discussed.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

This study explores P. motoro’s visual discrimination abilities in the context of two-alternative forced-choice experiments, with a focus on shape and contrast, stimulus orientation, and visual resolution. Results support that stingrays are able to discriminate stimulus-presence and -absence, overall stimulus contrasts, two forms, horizontal from vertical stimulus orientations, and different colors that also vary in brightness. Stingrays tested in visual resolution experiments demonstrated a range of visual acuities from < 0.13 to 0.23 cpd under the given experimental conditions.

In addition, predictable bodily damage can constrain locomotion even further. For example, for animals moving on land, losing legs may impose additional costs. We tested if losing legs affects the distance travelled over time (endurance) and the metabolic costs of locomotion (oxygen consumption) in Nelima paessleri harvestmen. These arachnids voluntary releases legs (i.e., autotomy) in response to predation attempts. We used flow-through respirometry as animals moved on a treadmill inside a sealed chamber. We found that endurance decreased gradually with an increasing number of legs lost. Interestingly, oxygen consumption increased only for harvestmen that lost three legs, but not for individuals that lost only a single leg. These results have different ecological and evolutionary implications. Reduced endurance may impair an animal's ability to continue moving away from potential predators, while increased oxygen consumption makes movement costlier. Our findings suggest that individuals have a threshold number of legs that can be lost before experiencing measurable energetic consequences. Overall, our findings illustrate how animals respond to morphological modifications (i.e., damage) that affect the physiology of locomotion.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Hearts were exposed in vitro to either severe hypoxia (~ 3% of air saturation), or severe hypercapnic acidosis (either 7.5% CO 2 or 15% CO 2 ), which reduced heart rate (in six test species) and net force development (in three test species). During hypoxia, heart rate was restored by [HCO 3 − ] in a dose-dependent fashion in lamprey, dogfish and eel (EC 50  = 5, 25 and 30 mM, respectively), but not in sturgeon, zebrafish or flounder. During hypercapnia, elevated [HCO 3 − ] completely restored heart rate in dogfish, eel and sturgeon (EC 50  = 5, 25 and 30 mM, respectively), had a partial effect in lamprey and zebrafish, and had no effect in flounder. Elevated [HCO 3 − ], however, had no significant effect on net force of electrically paced ventricular strips from dogfish, eel and flounder during hypoxia and hypercapnia. Only in lamprey hearts did a specific soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) inhibitor, KH7, block the HCO 3 − -mediated rescue of heart rate during both hypoxia and hypercapnia, and was the only species where we conclusively demonstrated sAC activity was involved in the protective effects of HCO 3 − on cardiac function. Our results suggest a common HCO 3 − -dependent, sAC-dependent transduction pathway for heart rate recovery exists in cyclostomes and a HCO 3 − -dependent, sAC-independent pathway exists in other fish species.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The usefulness of all these motions depends on the ability to control and adjust them to changing environmental conditions. A remarkable wealth of sensory receptors guarantees the necessary guidance. Many facets of such guidance have emerged from neuroethological research on the wandering spider Cupiennius salei and its allies, although sensori-motor control was not the main focus of this work. The present review may serve as a springboard for future studies aiming towards a more complete understanding of the spider’s control of its different types of motion. Among the topics shortly addressed are the involvement of lyriform slit sensilla in path integration, muscle reflexes in the walking legs, the monitoring of joint movement, the neuromuscular control of body raising, the generation of vibratory courtship signals, the sensory guidance of the jump to flying prey and the triggering of spiderling dispersal behavior.

We found that male H. punctigera have three distinct regions of the macroglomerular complex (MGC) in the antennal lobe. Male antennae have only two functional types of sensilla trichoidea (A and C) and type A sensilla contain an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) that responds to the major sex pheromone component (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Ald) with axons projecting to the cumulus of the macroglomerular complex (MGC) in the antennal lobe. Type C sensilla contained large-spiking receptor neurons which responded primarily to (Z)-9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Ald) and to a lesser degree to (Z)-11-hexadecenol (Z11-16:OH). These were co-compartmentalized with small-spiking receptor neurons in type C sensilla which responded strongly to Z9-14:Ald and (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z9-16:Ald), and to a lesser degree to (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:OAc) and Z11-16:OH. Axons from the two co-localized neurons in Type C sensilla projected to the two small MGC units, the dorsomedial anterior and dorsomedial posterior, respectively. In wind tunnel assays, the addition of Z9-16:Ald to an otherwise attractive blend completely shut down male H. punctigera upwind flight.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

In a natural population of any species, the survivorship curve is an important determinant of the relative abundances of ages and stages of development. Demography, thus, has significant implications for the study of comparative physiology. When Edward Deevey published his influential summary of survivorship in animal populations in the wild seven decades ago, he emphasized “serious deficiencies” because survivorship curves for natural populations at the time did not include data on the earliest life stages. Such data have accumulated over intervening years. We survey, for the first time, empirical knowledge of early-age survivorship in populations of most major animal groups in a state of nature. Despite wide variation, it is almost universally true that > 50% of newly born or hatched individuals die before the onset of sexual maturity, even in species commonly assumed to exhibit high early-age survivorship. These demographic facts are important considerations for studies in comparative and environmental physiology whether physiologists (i) aim to elucidate function throughout the life cycle, including both early stages and adults, or (ii) focus on adults (in which case early-age survivorship can potentially affect adult characteristics through selection or epigenesis). We establish that Deevey’s Type I curve (which applies to species with relatively limited early mortality) has few or no actual analogs in the real, natural world.",True,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Lesion experiments suggest two coupled modular timer-networks located along the chain of abdominal ganglia, a network in A3 and A4 generating the pulse pattern, and a network organized along with ganglia A4–A6 controlling the generation of the chirp rhythm. We analyzed neurons of the timer-networks and their synaptic connections by intracellular recordings and staining. We identified neurons spiking in phase with the chirps and pulses, or that are inhibited during the chirps. Neurons share a similar “gestalt”, regarding the position of the cell body, the dendritic arborizations and the contralateral ascending axon. Activating neurons of the pulse-timer network elicits ongoing motor activity driving the generation of pulses; this activity is not structured in the chirp pattern. Activating neurons of the chirp-timer network excites pulse-timer neurons; it drives the generation of chirps and during the chirps the pulse pattern is produced. Our results support the hypothesis that two modular networks along the abdominal ganglion chain control the cricket calling song, a pattern generating network in the mesothoracic ganglion may not be required.",True,"Journal of comparative physiology.

In hot environments, the main threat to endothermic homeotherms is insufficient water to supply that necessary for thermoregulation. We investigated flexible adjustment of traits related to thermoregulation and water conservation during acclimation to hot conditions or restricted water availability, or both, in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata a small arid-zone passerine. Using indirect calorimetry, we measured changes in whole animal metabolic rate (MR), evaporative heat loss (EHL) and T b before and after acclimation to 23 or 40 °C, with different availability of water. Additionally, we quantified changes in partitioning of EHL into respiratory and cutaneous avenues in birds exposed to 25 and 40 °C. In response to heat and water restriction zebra finches decreased MR, which together with unchanged EHL resulted in increased efficiency of evaporative heat loss. This facilitated more precise T b regulation in heat-acclimated birds. Acclimation temperature and water availability had no effect on the partitioning of EHL into cutaneous or respiratory avenues. At 25 °C, cutaneous EHL accounted for ~ 60% of total EHL, while at 40 °C, its contribution decreased to ~ 20%. Consistent among-individual differences in MR and EHL suggest that these traits, provided that they are heritable, may be a subject to natural selection. We conclude that phenotypic flexibility in metabolic heat production associated with acclimation to hot, water-scarce conditions is crucial in response to changing environmental conditions, especially in the face of current and predicted climate change.",True,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Although these roles have been examined independently in detail in adult fishes, less attention has been paid to the effects of an endogenous stress response during early life, particularly with respect to its potential effects on ionic/osmotic balance. The present study tested the hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to stress during early development would alter ion balance later in life. Zebrafish at three developmental stages (4, 7, or 15 days post-fertilization, dpf) were subjected to an air-exposure stressor twice a day for 2 days, causing elevation of whole-body cortisol levels. Individuals stressed early in life exhibited decreased survival and growth, altered cortisol responses to a subsequent air-exposure stressor, and increased whole-body Na + and Ca 2+ concentrations. Changes in whole-body Ca 2+ concentrations were accompanied by increased ionocyte abundance at 7 dpf and increased rates of Ca 2+ uptake from the environment. Differences in whole-body ion concentrations at 15 and 35 dpf were not accompanied by altered ion uptake rates. Across all ages examined, air-exposure stress experienced at 7 dpf was particularly effective at eliciting phenotypic changes, suggesting a critical window at this age for a stress response to influence development. These findings demonstrate that early-life stress in zebrafish triggers developmental plasticity, with age-dependent effects on both the cortisol stress axis and ion balance.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Herein, we investigate the freeze tolerance of this species and profile changes in liver and skeletal muscle metabolite levels using an untargeted LC–MS-based metabolomic approach to investigate molecular mechanisms that may contribute to freezing survival. We found that three of seven specimens of N. parkeri could survive after being frozen for 12 h at − 2.0 °C with 39.91% ± 5.4% ( n  = 7) of total body water converted to ice. Freezing exposure induced partial dehydration of the muscle, which contributed to decreasing the amount of freezable water within the muscle and could be protective for the myocytes themselves. A comparative metabolomic analysis showed that freezing elicited significant responses, and a total of 33 and 36 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in the liver and muscle, respectively. These metabolites mainly participate in alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. After freezing exposure, the contents of ornithine, melezitose, and maltotriose rose significantly; these may act as cryoprotectants. Additionally, the content of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine, 7-Ketocholesterol and hypoxanthine showed a marked increase, suggesting that freezing induced oxidative stress in the frogs. In summary, N. parkeri can tolerate a brief and partial freezing of their body, which was accompanied by substantial changes in metabolomic profiles after freezing exposure.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

With such sparse data on low-frequency hearing, there is little understanding of why some birds hear very low frequencies while others do not. To begin to expand the phylogenetic and ecological sample of low-frequency hearing in birds, we determined the behavioral audiogram of the Indian peafowl, Pavo cristatus. Peafowl are thought to use low frequencies generated by the males' tail feathers and wing flutters during courtship displays, and their crest feathers are reported to resonate at infrasound frequencies. The peafowl were able to respond to frequencies as low as 4 Hz, and their hearing range at 60 dB SPL extended from 29 Hz to 7.065 kHz (7.9 octaves). Removing the crest feathers reduced sensitivity at their resonant frequencies by as much as 7.5 dB, indicating a modest contribution to detectability in that range. However, perforation of the tympanic membranes severely reduced sensitivity to low frequencies, indicating that sensitivity to low frequencies is mediated primarily by the ears and cannot be attributed to some other sensory modality.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Recent studies, however, suggested that the brain also plays a role as a photosensor in their negative phototaxis behavior. In the present study, we investigated how the photosensory information acquired by the eye and brain is integrated. The visual pathway in the brain was traced by incorporating tracer molecules from the cut end of an optic nerve, and commissural interactions were found in optic neuropiles located in the lateral regions of the cerebral ganglia. A cluster of neuronal cell bodies located near the dorsal surface of the cerebral ganglion had connections with the contralateral optic neuropile via gap junctions. Some of these neuronal cell bodies were Opn5A-immunoreactive, and contained numerous photic vesicle-like structures. Light-induced spikes were recorded extracellularly from the dorsal surface of these neuronal clusters, and they were synchronous with the spikes recorded from the cut end of the cerebral commissure.

The well-documented postprandial tachycardia is triggered by an increase in adrenergic activity and by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) factors in mammals and crocodilians, while it is linked to a withdrawal of vagal drive and NANC factors in non-crocodilian ectotherms—except for fish, in which the sole investigation available indicated no participation of NANC factors. On the other hand, postprandial ventilatory adjustments vary widely among air-breathing vertebrates, with different species exhibiting hyperventilation, hypoventilation, or even no changes at all. Regarding fish, which live in an environment with low oxygen capacitance that requires great ventilatory effort for oxygen uptake, data on the ventilatory consequences of feeding are also scarce. Thus, the present study sought to investigate the postprandial cardiorespiratory adjustments and the mediation of digestion-associated tachycardia in the unimodal water-breathing teleost Oreochromis niloticus . Heart rate ( f H ), cardiac autonomic tones, ventilation rate ( f V ), ventilation amplitude, total ventilation and f H / f V variability were assessed both in fasting and digesting animals under untreated condition, as well as after muscarinic cholinergic blockade with atropine and double autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. The results revealed that digestion was associated with marked tachycardia in O. niloticus , determined by a reduction in cardiac parasympathetic activity and by circulating NANC factors—the first time such positive chronotropes were detected in digesting fish. Unexpectedly, postprandial ventilatory alterations were not observed, although digestion triggered mechanisms that were presumed to increase oxygen uptake, such as cardiorespiratory synchrony.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The role of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) in thermal tolerance of ventricular function was examined in brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) by measuring heart SERCA and comparing it to that of the dorsolateral myotomal muscle. Activity of SERCA was measured from crude homogenates of cold-acclimated (+ 3 °C, c.a.) and warm-acclimated (+ 13 °C, w.a.) brown trout as cyclopiazonic acid (20 µM) sensitive Ca 2+ -ATPase between + 3 and + 33 °C. Activity of the heart SERCA was significantly higher in c.a. than w.a. trout and increased strongly between + 3 and + 23 °C with linear Arrhenius plots but started to plateau between + 23 and + 33 °C in both acclimation groups. The rate of thermal inactivation of the heart SERCA at + 35 °C was similar in c.a. and w.a. fish. Activity of the muscle SERCA was less temperature dependent and more heat resistant than that of the heart SERCA and showed linear Arrhenius plots between + 3 and + 33 °C in both c.a. and w.a. fish. SERCA activity of the c.a. muscle was slightly higher than that of w.a. muscle. The rate of thermal inactivation at + 40 °C was similar for both c.a. and w.a. muscle SERCA at + 40 °C. Although the heart SERCA is more sensitive to high temperatures than the muscle SERCA, it is unlikely to be a limiting factor for heart rate, because its heat tolerance, unlike that of the ventricular beating rate, was not changed by temperature acclimation.",True,"Journal of comparative physiology.

They can be useful as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring of the marine compartment. Bivalve cellular immunity is ensured by phagocytosis and cytotoxic reactions carried out by hemocytes in a network with humoral responses. These can be affected by chemical contaminants in water that can be immunosuppressors also at a low concentration increasing the sensibility to pathogens. This work is an attempt to individuate cellular markers for pollution detection, investigating the effect of methylmercury (CH 3 HgCl) at different concentrations on the activity and hemocyte morphology of the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis . We assessed the effect of three sub-lethal concentrations of the organometal on the cellular morphology, the efficacy of phagocytosis toward yeast cells, the alteration of the lysosomal membrane and the ability to release cytotoxic molecules. The results provide information on the alteration of hemocyte viability, modification of the morphological and cytoskeletal features and besides the cellular spreading, intrinsic ability of motile cells was used as a complementary investigation method. Exposure to the contaminant affected the percentage of phagocytosis and the phagocytosis index. Moreover, morphological and cytoskeleton alteration, caused by the pollutant, leads to reduced ability to incorporate the target and adhere to the substrate and the low ability of cells to retain neutral red could depend on the effects of methylmercury on membrane permeability. These results reinforce the use of the Mediterranean mussel as model for the evaluation of environmental quality in aquatic ecosystems integrating the novel information about hemocyte functions and morphology sensibility to organic mercury.

The conduction velocity/distance relationship is best described by an exponentially rising, asymptotic curve. A numerical model for regional variations in impulse conduction velocity in these sensory neurons was developed, based upon neuronal morphological metrics and physiological data. The predicted relationship between conduction velocity and length of conduction pathway in the model was compared to experimental data from 88 sensory neurons associated with thoracic near-field receptor sensilla, in which both the mean conduction velocity and the length of the conduction pathway for each neuron were known. Curves fitted to the conduction velocity versus distance relationship in the two cases were similar, although not congruent. Chi-square statistics comparing the curves predict that the curves are similar at the 0.005 probability level, suggesting that the numerical model's variations in axonal morphology can satisfactorily account for the observed conduction velocity-distance relationship in these sensory neurons.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

When chronic low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions occur, organisms must adjust to overcome this stressor's effect on metabolic rates. The bearded fireworm, Hermodice carunculata, is a widespread species frequently exposed to hypoxic conditions in areas within its broad distribution which may impact metabolism, wound healing, and regeneration. To study the impact of hypoxia on their metabolic rates, we exposed fireworms to two levels of lower than normal DO conditions (low 2.5 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1 and mid 4.5 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1) for 7 days by pumping nitrogen into their holding tanks. During a chronic hypoxia trial, we quantified oxygen consumption in each experimental group and subsequently determined post-hypoxia oxygen consumption of individuals from the lowest oxygen level. During the hypoxic exposure, the oxygen uptake rates declined in low and mid DO conditions, while remaining relatively constant for the normoxic (7.0 ± 0.25 mg O2 L-1) control. We then compared the oxygen consumption rates from the lowest DO condition to fireworms likely never exposed to hypoxia and fireworms from a location likely to be exposed to hypoxia. We found higher oxygen consumption rates in the experimentally hypoxia-exposed worms. These results suggest prolonged negative impacts of hypoxic exposure, leading to a lasting elevation of metabolic rates of these marine invertebrates. The increase in metabolic rates may lead to increased predation on their prey of choice, economically and commercially important coral, causing increased degradation of already threatened coral reef ecosystems.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

This is particularly significant in species with low offspring survival such as sea turtle species, because of the extremely high predation rates that hatchlings face during their initial dispersal from nesting beaches. Hatchlings that develop in suboptimal nest environments are likely to be smaller, slower and more susceptible to predation than hatchlings from optimal nest environments. Previous studies have focused on the effects of temperature on hatchling traits, but few have investigated the effects of moisture concentrations, despite moisture levels in nests influencing hatchling size, sex, incubation duration, and hatching success. Here, we incubated eggs of three sea turtle species at various moisture levels and tested the terrestrial and aquatic locomotor performance of the resultant hatchlings during the frenzy and post-frenzy period. We also compared and evaluated the ontogeny of early locomotor performance for each species over the first months of life. Drier incubation conditions produced hatchlings that crawled more slowly and took longer to self-right than hatchlings from wetter incubation conditions. There was no difference in swimming performance associated with moisture treatments. We suggest that moisture in the nest environment during incubation may influence hatchling performance via their initial hydration levels. Thus, nest moisture influences terrestrial performance (i.e., escaping from the nest and dispersing across the beach), although upon entering the ocean hatchlings have the opportunity to rehydrate by drinking and thus, differences in locomotor performance associated with moisture treatments cease.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Cardiac function has been poorly studied in the cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa, which has some advantages for experimental purposes such as an easier culture, bigger organs and a robust physiology. On the other hand, the study of cardiac physiology in insects has been largely improved since the arrival of digital imaging technologies for recording purposes. In the present work, we introduce a methodology of video recording coupled to an isotonic transducer for a three-dimensional analysis of the heart and intracardiac valves of G. portentosa. We used this methodology for assessing the physiological responses of the cockroach heart upon the application of different cholinergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, nicotine and muscarine). We recorded in detail the relationship between intracardiac valves movement, hemolymph flow, diastole and systole. Acetylcholine and nicotine induced a biphasic effect on the cardiac frequency. Acetylcholine increased the diastolic opening. Nicotine at high concentration caused paralysis. Muscarine induced no major effects. These findings suggest a combined action of cholinergic agonists for a finely tuned the cardiac frequency, intracardiac valves function and cardiac cycle.

French populations of the frog Xenopus laevis from the invasion front are known to possess greater terrestrial locomotor endurance. Here, we tested whether individuals from the invasion front show differences in their muscle physiology that may underlie the observed whole-organism performance differences. We measured muscle contractile properties of the isolated gastrocnemius muscle in vitro, including isometric stress, activation and relaxation time, and work loop power output, both before and during a period of fatiguing contractions. We found that frogs from the centre of the range can produce tetanus force in their gastrocnemius muscle faster than animals from the periphery of the range, which could contribute to higher performance in one-off jumps. Yet, populations did not differ in muscle endurance. These results, coupled with previous work on this invasive population of Xenopus laevis, suggest that the greater stamina observed in individuals from the periphery may be more due to anatomical differences such as longer hind limbs and larger hearts along with potentially other as of yet untested physiological differences rather than differences in the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

In fact, rising global temperatures have already caused widespread extinctions among lizards. Viviparous species might be more susceptible to increasing temperatures because of their inability to meet their energetic demands following rapid environmental changes. Nevertheless, we do not yet fully understand how lizards with different reproductive modes can respond to climate change. We investigated the effect of both maternal thermal environment during pregnancy and incubation temperature on hatchling morphology and physiological performance of two populations of the lizard Saiphos equalis differing in their mode of reproduction, to test whether reproductive mode affects the ability to buffer against rising temperatures. Gravid females from both populations were subjected to current or projected end-of-century (future) thermal environments, to evaluate differences in the body size, growth rate, thermal preference, and locomotor performance of their offspring. Our results show that independently of the mode of reproduction, high temperatures accelerated gestation periods. Thermal environments did not affect hatchling thermal preference, but viviparous hatchlings consistently preferred lower temperatures. Unlike viviparous lizards, oviparous hatchlings incubated under future temperatures were smaller and had a lower growth rate compared to current-incubated hatchlings. Finally, thermal environments did not affect hatchling endurance and speed when controlling for body size. Our results show that global warming is likely to have a negative impact on S. equalis, but suggest that some of its effects may be ameliorated by maternal responses during pregnancy, particularly in viviparous populations.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

We compare two model populations (“Sea”, Sp, and “Lake”, Lp) inhabiting, respectively, a low light and an extremely dark environment. 11-cis retinal reached 60–70% of the pre-exposure levels after 2 weeks in darkness in both populations. The only significant Lp/Sp difference in the retinoid cycle was that Lp had much higher levels of retinol, both basal and light-released. In Sp, rhodopsin restoration and eye photoresponse recovery parallelled 11-cis retinal regeneration. In Lp, however, even after 3 weeks only ca. 25% of the rhabdoms studied had incorporated new rhodopsin, and eye photosensitivity showed only incipient recovery from severe depression. The absorbance spectra of the majority of the Lp rhabdoms stayed constant around 490–500 nm, consistent with metarhodopsin II dominance.

Dramatic changes characterize this crucial event in the salmon's life cycle, including increased gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity (NKA) and plasma hormone levels. The triggering of smoltification relies on photoperiod and is modulated by temperature. Both provide reliable information, to which fish have adapted for thousands of years, that allows deciphering daily and calendar time. Here we studied the impact of different photoperiod (natural, sustained winter solstice) and temperature (natural, ~ + 4° C) combinations, on gill NKA, plasma free triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and melatonin (MEL; the time-keeping hormone), throughout smoltification. We also studied the impact of temperature history on pineal gland MEL production in vitro. The spring increase in gill NKA was less pronounced in smolts kept under sustained winter photoperiod and/or elevated temperature. Plasma thyroid hormone levels displayed day-night variations, which were affected by elevated temperature, either independently from photoperiod (decrease in T3 levels) or under natural photoperiod exclusively (increase in T4 nocturnal levels). Nocturnal MEL secretion was potentiated by the elevated temperature, which also altered the MEL profile under sustained winter photoperiod. Temperature also affected pineal MEL production in vitro, a response that depended on previous environmental acclimation of the organ. The results support the view that the salmon pineal is a photoperiod and temperature sensor, highlight the complexity of the interaction of these environmental factors on the endocrine system of S. salar, and indicate that climate change might compromise salmon's time ""deciphering"" during smoltification, downstream migration and seawater residence.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

The greater protein intake during this phase results in marked increases in the production of nitrogenous wastes (N-waste), which are excreted primarily via the gills. However, it is unknown how gill structure and function change during metamorphosis and how it is related to modes of ammonia excretion, nor do we have a good understanding of how the sea lamprey's transition from fresh water (FW) to sea water (SW) affects patterns and mechanisms of N-waste excretion in relation to ionoregulation. Using immunohistochemistry, we related changes in the gill structure of larval, metamorphosing, and juvenile sea lampreys to their patterns of ammonia excretion (Jamm) and urea excretion (Jurea) in FW, and following FW to artificial seawater (ASW) transfer. Rates of Jamm and Jurea were low in larval sea lamprey and increased in feeding juvenile, parasitic sea lamprey. In freshwater-dwelling ammocoetes, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Rhesus glycoprotein C-like protein (Rhcg-like) was diffusely distributed on the lamellar epithelium, but following metamorphosis, Rhcg-like protein was restricted to SW mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs; ionocytes) between the gill lamellae. Notably, these interlamellar Rhcg-like proteins co-localized with Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), which increased in expression and activity by almost tenfold during metamorphosis. The distribution of V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) on the lamellae decreased following metamorphosis, indicating it may have a more important role in acid-base regulation and Na+ uptake in FW, compared to SW. We conclude that the re-organization of the sea lamprey gill during metamorphosis not only plays a critical role in allowing them to cope with greater salinity following the FW-SW transition, but that it simultaneously reflects fundamental changes in methods used to excrete ammonia.",False,"Journal of comparative physiology.

Marine mammals were long thought not to be susceptible to such dive-related injury, yet evidence of DCS-like injury and new models of tissue nitrogen super-saturation suggest that bubbles may routinely form. As such, it is possible that marine mammals have protective adaptations that allow them to deal with a certain level of bubble formation during normal dives, without acute adverse effects. This work evaluated the complement response, indicative of inflammation, to in vitro nitrogen bubble exposures in several marine mammal species to assess whether a less-responsive immune system serves a protective role against DCS-like injury in these animals. Serum samples from beluga ( Delphinapterus leucas ), and harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina ) (relatively shallow divers) and deep diving narwhal ( Monodon monoceros ), and Weddell seals ( Leptonychotes weddellii ) were exposed to nitrogen bubbles in vitro. Complement activity was evaluated by measuring changes in the terminal protein C5a in serum, and results suggest marine mammal complement is less sensitive to gas bubbles than human complement, but the response varies between species. Species-specific differences may be related to dive ability, and suggest moderate or shallow divers may be more susceptible to DCS-like injury.

High hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a feature of these important ecosystems and its toxicity creates a challenge for mangrove inhabitants. The mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is a selfing, hermaphroditic, amphibious fish that can survive exposure to 1116 μM H2S in the wild. These fish rely on cutaneous respiration for gas and ion exchange when emerged. We hypothesized that the skin surface is fundamentally important in H2S tolerance in these mangrove fish by limiting H2S permeability. To test our hypothesis, we first disrupted the skin surface in one isogenic lineage and measured H2S tolerance and sensitivity. We increased water H2S concentration until emersion as a measure of the ability to sense and react to H2S, which we refer to as sensitivity. We then determined H2S tolerance by preventing emersion and increasing H2S until loss of equilibrium (LOE). The H2S concentration at emersion and LOE were significantly affected by disrupting the skin surface, providing support that the skin is involved in limiting H2S permeability. Capitalizing on their unique reproductive strategy, we used three distinct isogenic lineages to test the hypothesis that there would be genetic differences in H2S sensitivity and tolerance. We found significant differences in emersion concentration only among lineages, suggesting a genetic component to H2S sensitivity but not tolerance. Our study also demonstrated that external skin modifications and avoidance behaviours are two distinct strategies used to tolerate ecologically relevant H2S concentrations and likely facilitate survival in challenging mangrove habitats.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Optically recorded calcium responses to wide-band noise and to frequency-modulated bursts were recorded at probe depths down to 1300 µm, with the majority of active sites encountered at more shallow depths down to 800 µm. Calcium activity exhibited long latencies, within the time span of 50–100 ms after stimulus onset, significantly longer than onset latencies of either multi-unit activity or local field potentials. Latencies and amplitude/latency trading of these electrical responses were consistent with those seen in standard electrophysiological recordings, confirming that the microendoscope was able to record both neural and optical activity successfully. Optically recorded calcium responses rose and decayed slowly and were correlated in time with long-latency negative deflections in local field potentials.

To test this hypothesis, we compared cardiac contractility and adrenergic responsiveness of juvenile sockeye salmon from two geographically isolated populations that were reared from eggs under common garden conditions and at two acclimation temperatures (5 °C and 14 °C). However, we found no substantive differences in the force-frequency response (FFR) and the cardiac pumping capacity of juveniles from Weaver Creek and Chilko River populations, even when we considered wild-reared juveniles from one of the populations. An unexpected discovery for all fish groups at 5 °C was a rather flat FFR during tonic β-adrenergic stimulation (βAR) stimulation. Curiously, while active tension nearly doubled with maximum βAR stimulation at low pacing frequencies for all fish groups, a negative FFR with maximum βAR stimulation meant that this inotropic benefit was lost at the highest pacing frequency (0.8 Hz). Active tension with tonic βAR stimulation was similar at 14 °C, but maximum pacing frequency doubled and all fish groups displayed a modest negative FFR. Maximum βAR stimulation again doubled active tension and this benefit was retained even at the highest pacing frequency (1.6 Hz) at 14 °C. Even though subtle population differences were apparent for the FFR and pumping capacity, their biological significance is unclear. What is clear, however, is that the cardiac pumping capacity of juvenile sockeye would benefit more from βAR stimulation swimming at 15 °C than when swimming at 5 °C.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

They are pleiotropic neuromolecules which so far have been mainly associated with regulation of feeding and metabolism, as well as growth and development, locomotion, circadian rhythm or learning and memory. Here, we describe the effects of Tenebrionid sNPF peptide (SGRSPSLRLRFa) on various aspects of the male reproductive physiology in the Tenebrio molitor beetle. We identified in silico the putative sNPF receptor Tenmo-sNPFR. Based on RT-PCR technique, it was shown that the receptor might be present in the male reproductive tissues of this beetle. The analysis of receptor amino acid sequence showed that it is similar to other beetle sNPFRs, as well as other insect species, and belongs rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Injections of Trica-sNPF and its shorter form Trica-sNPF(4–11) caused differentiated effects in T. molitor male reproductive tissues. After 24 h post injections, the peptides decreased the concentration of the soluble protein fraction in testes of 4- and 8-day-old beetles as well as the dry mass of these organs but only in 8-day-old individuals. The same effects were shown with regard to accessory glands. Both peptides decrease the concentration of the soluble protein fraction but do not affect the dry mass of this organ. Furthermore, injections of Trica-sNPF at the 10–7 M concentration decrease the total sperm number in the reproductive system. Surprisingly, the same concentration of the shorter form, Trica-sNPF(4–11) increased the sperm number. It was also shown that both peptides in different manner influence contractions of ejaculatory duct.

SKs together with sulfakinin receptors (SKRs) are involved in sulfakinin signaling responsible for variety of biological functions, including food intake or fatty acid metabolism. In the present study, we determined the distribution of SKRs in Tenebrio molitor larvae and characterized the impact of nonsulfated and sulfated SKs on carbohydrates and insulin-like peptides (ILPs) level in beetle hemolymph. Our results indicate the presence of both sulfakinin receptors, SKR1 and SKR2, in the nervous system of T. molitor. The distribution of SKR2 in peripheral tissues was more widespread than SKR1, and their transcripts have been found in fat body, gut and hemolymph. This is also the first evidence for SKRs presence in insect hemocytes indicating immunotropic activity of SKs. Moreover, in the present study, we have demonstrated that SKs regulate ILPs and carbohydrates level in insect hemolymph, and that sulfation is not crucial for peptides activity.

Although circabidian rhythm is suggested to involve the circadian clock, no physiological studies have been conducted to verify this involvement. We examined the effects of optic lobe or pars intercerebralis removal on the circabidian rhythm. After removing both optic lobes, all beetles lost their circabidian rhythms (N = 25), but all beetles exhibited circabidian rhythm after removing unilateral optic lobe (N = 18). However, 22% of the latter group exhibited day switching. After removal of the pars intercerebralis, 26.3% beetles showed arrhythmic patterns (N = 19). The number of paraldehyde fuchsin-stained pars intercerebralis cells in the arrhythmic group was significantly reduced compared to in the intact and sham-operated groups. The activity in the pars intercerebralis-removed beetles was significantly higher than that in the control groups. The results show that the optic lobe and at least part of the pars intercerebralis are necessary for circabidian rhythm, and bilateral optic lobes are necessary to maintain regularity of the two-day rhythm in H. parallela. This suggests that a neural circuit of circadian clock cells in the optic lobe to pars lateralis might be evolutionally conserved and used also for the generation of circabidian rhythm.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested the idea that electrostatic attraction forces between tiny whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) and the substrate could be substantial to the point of limiting their take-off. These insects are characterized by a very small body mass and powerful take-offs that are executed by jumping into the air with the wings closed. Wing opening and transition to active flight occur after the jump distanced the insect several body lengths away from the substrate. Using high-speed cameras, we captured the take-off behavior inside a uniform electrostatic field apparatus and used dead insects to calculate the electric charge that these tiny insects can carry. We show that electrostatic forces stimulate the opening of the insect's wings and can attract the whole insect toward the opposite charge. We also found that whiteflies can carry and hold an electrical charge of up to 3.5 pC. With such a charge the electrostatic field required to impede take-off is much stronger than those typically found in the natural environment. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that artificial electrostatic fields can be effectively used to suppress flight of whiteflies, thus providing options for pest control applications in greenhouses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The mRNA and protein expression levels of NKA and NKCC1 in the gills all increased rapidly in the first four days after transfer to SW. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that NKCC1 and NKA were colocalized in the branchial ionocytes and the immunoreaction of NKCC1 was stronger after transfer.

Restricting food availability or increasing energy expenditure (e.g., thermoregulation) inhibits reproductive development in multiple avian species, but the nature of the energy-related signal mediating this effect is unclear. To investigate this question, we examined reproductive and metabolic physiology in male house finches that either underwent moderate food restriction (FR) or were exposed to high temperature (HT), in which birds were held at a high, but not locally atypical, ambient temperature cycle (37.8 °C day, 29.4 °C night) compared to a control group (CT; 29.4 °C day, 21.1 °C night). We hypothesized that FR and HT inhibit reproductive development by lowering available metabolic fuel, in particular plasma glucose (GLU) and free fatty acids (FFA). Following FR for 4 weeks, finches lost body mass, had marginally higher plasma FFA, and experienced a 90% reduction in testis mass compared to CT birds. Four weeks of HT exposure resulted in reduced voluntary food consumption and muscle mass, as well as an 80% reduction in testis mass relative to CT birds. Both FR and HT birds expressed less testicular 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) mRNA than controls but the expression of other testicular genes measured was unaffected by either treatment. Neither treatment significantly influenced plasma GLU. This study is among the first to demonstrate a negative effect of HT on reproductive development in a wild bird.

As global water temperatures continue to increase, so does the need to understand the capacity of organisms to tolerate change. Sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) are the most eurythermic fish species known to date and can tolerate a wide range of environmental temperatures from − 1.9 to 43.0 °C. But little is known about the physiological adjustments that occur when these fish are subjected to acute thermal challenges and long-term thermal acclimation. Minnows were acclimated to 10, 21, or 32 °C for 4 weeks or acutely exposed to 10 and 32 °C and then assessed for swimming performance [maximum sustained swimming velocity (Ucrit), optimum swimming velocity (Uopt)] and metabolic endpoints (extrapolated standard and maximum metabolic rate [SMR, MMR), absolute aerobic scope (AS), and cost of transport (COT)]. Our findings show that the duration of thermal exposure (acute vs. acclimation) did not influence swimming performance. Rather, swimming performance was influenced by the exposure temperature. Swimming performance was statistically similar in fish exposed to 21 or 32 °C (approximately 7.0 BL s−1), but was drastically reduced in fish exposed to 10 °C (approximately 2.0 BL s−1), resulting in a left-skewed performance curve. There was no difference in metabolic end points between fish acutely exposed or acclimated to 10 °C. However, a different pattern was observed in fish exposed to 32 °C. MMR was similar between acutely exposed or acclimated fish, but acclimated fish had a 50% reduction in extrapolated SMR, which increased AS by 25%. However, this enhanced AS was not associated with changes in swimming performance, which opposes the oxygen-capacity limited thermal tolerance concept. Our findings suggest that sheepshead minnows may utilize two distinct acclimation strategies, resulting in different swimming performance and metabolic patterns observed between 10 and 32 °C exposures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, their lens-based underwater accommodative mechanism presumably requires a small pupil that may limit sensitivity across light levels. In this study, we consider adaptations for amphibious living by assessing the tapetum lucidum, retina, and pupil dynamics in sea otters. The sea otter tapetum lucidum resembles that of terrestrial carnivores in thickness and fundic coverage. A heavily rod-dominated retina appears qualitatively similar to the ferret and domestic cat, and a thick outer nuclear layer relative to a thinner inner nuclear layer is consistent with nocturnal vertebrates and other amphibious carnivores. Pupil size range in two living sea otters is smaller relative to other amphibious marine carnivores (pinnipeds) when accounting for test conditions. The pupillary light response seems slower than other aquatic and terrestrial species tested in comparable brightness, although direct comparisons require further assessment. Our results suggest that sea otters have retained features for low-light vision but rapid adjustments and acute underwater vision may be constrained across varying light levels by a combination of pupil shape, absolute eye size, and the presumed coupling between anterior lens curvature and pupil size during accommodation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

They detect substrate-borne vibrations induced by the movement of the prey. European pit-building antlions ( Myrmeleon inconspicuus ) are studied for their ability to perceive vibrations generated by the locomotion of an ant ( Cataglyphis cursor ) outside the pit. These strides have been recorded and copied in detail in their time sequences. The signal created was emitted by piezoelectric transducers placed several centimeters outside the peripheries of the pits: the ant movements create waves with particle accelerations that are three orders of magnitude less than g , alleviating any possibility of sand avalanche towards the bottom of the pit. Depending on the amplitude of the vibrations, the antlions answer back, generally by sand tossing. One remarkable feature is the time delay between the start of the cue and the predatory behaviour induced by this cue. This time delay is studied versus the cue amplitude. We found that antlions answer back within minutes to cues with amplitudes of nanometer range, and within seconds to these same cues if they are preceded by a sequence of signals at the Ångström amplitude.

Uninsulated appendages (flippers and feet) could provide flexible heat exchange during subsequent rewarming. Here, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral vasodilation could be delayed during this recovery stage. To this end, we designed an experiment to examine patterns of surface rewarming in fully hypothermic (the cloaca and peripheral regions (here; flippers, feet and the breast) < 37 °C) and partially hypothermic (cloaca at normothermia ≥ 37 °C, but periphery at hypothermia) king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) when they rewarmed in the laboratory. Both groups rewarmed during the 21 min observation period, but the temperature changes were larger in fully than in partially hypothermic birds. Moreover, we observed a 5 min delay of peripheral temperature in fully compared to partially hypothermic birds, suggesting that this process was impacted by low internal temperature. To investigate whether our laboratory data were applicable to field conditions, we also recorded surface temperatures of free-ranging penguins after they came ashore to the colony. Initial surface temperatures were lower in these birds compared to in those that rewarmed in the laboratory, and changed less over a comparable period of time on land. This could be explained both by environmental conditions and possible handling-induced thermogenesis in the laboratory. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that appendage vasodilation is flexibly used during rewarming and that recovery may be influenced by both internal temperature and environmental conditions when penguins transition from sea to land.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In bush-crickets, the largest population of local auditory neurons in the prothoracic processing centre are dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons. It has been suggested that DUM neurons are inhibitory using γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as transmitter. Immunohistochemistry reveals a population of about 35–50 GABA-positive somata in the posterior medial cluster of the prothoracic ganglion. Only very few small somata in this cluster remain unstained. At least 10 neurites from 10 neurons can be identified. Intracellularly stained auditory DUM neurons have their soma in the cluster of median GABA positive cells and most of them exhibit GABA-immunoreactivity. Responses of certain DUM neurons show obvious signs of inhibition. Application of picrotoxin (PTX), a chloride-channel blocker in insects, changes the responses of many DUM neurons. They become broader in frequency tuning and broader or narrower in temporal pattern tuning. Furthermore, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) may be replaced by excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Loss of an IPSP in the rising graded potential after PTX-application leads to a significant reduction of first-spike latency. Therefore, auditory DUM neurons receive effective inhibition and are the best candidates for inhibition in DUM neurons and other auditory interneurons.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Masking efficiency was varied by masker-to-test delay variation from 2 to 20 ms, and masker levels at threshold (MLTs) were evaluated at each of the delays. It was assumed that low-frequency maskers were not subjected or little subjected to compression whereas on-frequency maskers were subjected equally to the test. Therefore, the compression rate was assessed as the slope of low-frequency MLT dependence on on-frequency MLT. For the 90-kHz test, the slopes were 0.63 and 0.18 dB/dB for masker of − 0.25 and − 0.5 oct, respectively.

This is especially true for cooperative foraging which provides fitness benefits through more efficient acquisition and consumption of food. While examples of group foraging have been widely described, the principles governing formation of such aggregations and rules that determine group membership remain poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of an experimental model system featuring cooperative foraging behavior in Drosophila. Under crowded conditions, fly larvae form coordinated digging groups (clusters), where individuals are linked together by sensory cues and group membership requires prior experience. However, fitness benefits of Drosophila larval clustering remain unknown. We demonstrate that animals raised in crowded conditions on food partially processed by other larvae experience a developmental delay presumably due to the decreased nutritional value of the substrate. Intriguingly, same conditions promote the formation of cooperative foraging clusters which further extends larval stage compared to non-clustering animals. Remarkably, this developmental retardation also results in a relative increase in wing size, serving an indicator of adult fitness. Thus, we find that the clustering-induced developmental delay is accompanied by fitness benefits. Therefore, cooperative foraging, while delaying development, may have evolved to give Drosophila larvae benefits when presented with competition for limited food resources.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Key regulators of nutrient allocation and tissue specific growth include metabolic hormones of the somatotropic axis, growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, as well as satiety and adipose promoting ghrelin and the stress hormone cortisol. Longitudinal measurements of metabolic hormones, blood metabolites, and morphometrics were collected over a 10-week period in twelve (male n = 3, female n = 9) harbor seal pups (< 6 weeks of age). Blood metabolites were used to indicate metabolic response during realimentation while morphometrics estimated tissue specific growth priorities. Harbor seal pups undergoing refeeding after nutritional deprivation show a preference for protein sparing despite severe malnutrition. Both BUN and total protein were negatively associated with GH and positively associated with IGF-I and ghrelin highlighting the importance of these metabolic hormones in the regulation of protein metabolism. While the response of the somatotropic axis to realimentation was typical of the mammalian pattern, the surprising increase of ghrelin across the study period suggests the priority of adipose accretion in addition to a possible mechanism regulating compensatory growth of vital adipose stores in a species, which prioritizes adipose accretion for survival.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The Pacific spiny dogfish can experience and tolerate reduced environmental salinities, yet how this environmental challenge may affect the microbiome, and consequently nitrogen transport across the gut, is as of yet unknown. In the present study, excised gut sac preparations were made from dogfish acclimated to the following: full-strength seawater (C), low salinity for 7 days (LS), and after acute transfer of LS-acclimated fish to full-strength SW for 6 h (AT). Significantly reduced microbial derived urease activity was observed in the mucosal saline of gut sac preparations from the LS (by 81%) and AT (by 89%) treatments relative to the C treatment. Microbial derived cellulase activity from mucosal saline samples tended to follow similar patterns. To further ensure an effective decrease in the spiral valve microbial population, an antibiotic cocktail was applied to the mucosal saline used for in vitro measurements of ion, water, and nitrogen flux in these gut sac preparations. This caused a further 57–61% decrease in the mucosal saline urease activity of the C and LS treatments. Overall, we observed relatively little flux across the stomach for all measured parameters aside from water movement, which switched from a net efflux in control fish to a net influx in acutely transferred fish, indicative of drinking. While no significant differences were observed in terms of nitrogen flux (urea or ammonia), we tended to see the accumulation of ammonia in the spiral valve lumen and a switch from efflux to influx of urea in control versus acutely transferred fish. The increased ammonia production likely occurs as a result of heightened metabolism in a challenging environment, while the retention and acquisition of urea is suggestive of nitrogen scavenging under nitrogen-limiting conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Therefore, they provide a unique opportunity for comparative evolutionary research, in examining pregnancy independent of the female reproductive tract. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the most complex form of syngnathid pregnancy involves nutrient transport from father to offspring. We compared the dry masses of newly fertilised Hippocampus abdominalis eggs with those of fully developed neonates to derive a patrotrophy index. The patrotrophy index of H. abdominalis was 1, indicating paternal nutrient supplementation to embryos during gestation. We also measured the lipid content of newly fertilised eggs and neonates and found that there was no significant decrease in lipid mass during embryonic development.

Overall, the results are consistent with the magnetite hypothesis of magnetoreception, yet also reveal that in spiny lobsters, a strong pulse altered expression of > 10% of all expressed genes, including many seemingly unrelated to sensory processes. Thus, caution is required when interpreting the effects of magnetic pulses on animal behavior.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Neotropical nectar-feeding bats responses to direct and indirect costs of extreme environmental temperatures,"One of the consequences of anthropogenic climate change is an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These events have caused mass mortality of different species of wildlife, including bats. In this study, we exposed two species of neotropical nectar-feeding bats that live in contrasting environmental conditions ( A. geoffroyi and L. yerbabuenae ) to extreme high and low temperatures while offering them diets with different energy content. This experimental approach allowed us to determine their thermal and behavioral responses, and to identify environmental conditions that impose high physiologic costs to these species. To determine how bats' responded, we monitored both changes in their body masses and skin temperatures. Both bat species responded differently, with L. yerbabuenae spending more time in normothermia at high temperatures than A. geoffroyi . While both species presented torpor, they used it differently. Torpor allowed A. geoffroyi to maintain and increase body mass at intermediate and low ambient temperatures. At the same time, L. yerbabuenae used torpor only when facing cold ambient temperatures and low-quality food. Understanding the mechanisms that allow species to face changes in their environment is essential given the current climate trends and the fact that the loss of these species could have significant negative consequences in tropical and subtropical ecosystems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study aimed to (1) collect anatomical data and inertial properties of the sheep middle-ear ossicles and (2) explore effects of these features on sound transmission, in comparison to those of the human. Characteristic dimensions and inertial properties of the middle-ear ossicles of White-Alpine sheep ( n  = 11) were measured from high-resolution micro-CT data, and were assessed in comparison with the corresponding values of the human middle ear. The sheep middle-ear ossicles differed from those of human in several ways: anteroinferior orientation of the malleus handle, relatively small size of the incus with a relatively short distance to the lenticular process, a large area of the articular surfaces at the incudostapedial joint, and a relatively small moment of inertia along the anterior–posterior axis. Analysis in this study suggests that structure and orientation of the middle-ear ossicles in the sheep are conducive to an increase in the hinge-like ossicular-lever-action around the anterior–posterior axis. Considering the substantial anatomical differences, outcomes of middle-ear surgeries would presumably be difficult to assess from experiments using the sheep middle ear.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in water and salt balances in desert rodents are unknown. We hypothesized that desert rodents regulated water and salt balances by altering the expression of AQP2 and α-ENaC in the kidney. Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), a desert species, were acclimated to drinking water with different salt contents: (0, control; 4% NaCl, moderate salt, MS; 8% NaCl, high salt, HS) for 4 weeks. The gerbils drinking salty water had lower body mass, food intake, water intake, metabolic water production and urine volume. The HS gerbils increased the expression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the hypothalamus, and also enhanced the expression of AQP2 and cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway in the kidney. In addition, these gerbils reduced serum aldosterone levels and α-ENaC expression in the kidney. Creatinine clearance was lower in the HS group than that in the control group, but serum and urine creatinine levels did not change. These data indicate that desert rodents rely on AVP-dependent upregulation of AQP2 and aldosterone-dependent downregulation of α-ENaC in the kidney to promote water reabsorption and sodium excretion under high salt intake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To accurately localise the nest at the end of a foraging journey, visual cues, wind direction and also olfactory cues need to be learnt. Learning walks are performed at the start of an ant’s foraging career or when the appearance of the nest surrounding has changed. We investigated here whether the structure of such learning walks in the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis takes into account wind direction in conjunction with the learning of new visual information. Ants learnt to travel back and forth between their nest and a feeder, and we then introduced a black cylinder near their nest to induce learning walks in regular foragers. By doing this across days with different wind directions, we were able to probe how ants balance different sensory modalities. We found that (1) the ants’ outwards headings are influenced by the wind direction with their routes deflected such that they will arrive downwind of their target, (2) a novel object along the route induces learning walks in experienced ants and (3) the structure of learning walks is shaped by the wind direction rather than the position of the visual cue.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It, therefore, is expected that A. gigas, starting as a water breather, progressively turns into an obligate air-breathing fish using an air-breathing organ (ABO) for gas exchange. We assessed the air-breathing activity, O2 and CO2 exchange into air and water, ammonia-N and urea-N excretion, ion flux rates, and activities of ion transport ATPases in large versus small pirarucu. We found that even very young A. gigas (4–6 g, 2–3 weeks post-hatch) with extensive gills are air-breathers (18.1 breaths*h−1) and cover most (63%) of their O2 requirements from the air whereas 600–700-g animals (about 3–4 months post-hatch), with reduced gills, obtain 75% of their O2 from the air (10.8 breaths*h−1). Accordingly, the reduction in gill surface area hardly affected O2 uptake, but development had a significant effect on aerial CO2 excretion, which was very low (3%) in small fish and increased to 12% in larger fish, yielding a hyper-allometric scaling coefficient (1.12) in contrast to 0.82–0.84 for aquatic and total CO2 excretion. Mass-specific ammonia excretion decreased in approximate proportion to mass-specific O2 consumption as the fish grew, but urea-N excretion dropped from 18% (at 4–6 g) to 8% (at 600–700 g) of total N-excretion; scaling coefficients for all these parameters were 0.70–0.80. Mass-specific sodium influx and efflux rates, as well as potassium net loss rates, departed from this pattern, being greater in larger fish; hyper-allometric scaling coefficients were > 1.0. Gill V-type H+ ATPase activities were greater than Na+, K+-ATPase activities, but levels were generally low and comparable in large and small fish, and similar activities were detected in the ABO. A. gigas is a carnivorous fish throughout its lifecycle, and, despite fasting, protein oxidation accounted for the major portion (61–82%) of aerobic metabolism in both large and small animals. ABO PO2 and PCO2 (measured in 600–700-g fish) were quite variable, and aerial hypoxia resulted in lower ABO PO2 values. Under normoxic conditions, a positive correlation between breath volume and ABP PO2 was detected, and on average with a single breath more than 50% of the ABO volume was exchanged. ABO PCO2 values were in the range of 1.95–3.89 kPa, close to previously recorded blood PCO2 levels.

For example, both the stress response (i.e. fight-or-flight) and the immune response recruit molecular resources from other body tissues, and induce physiological changes that optimize the body for defense. However, pathogens and predators often co-occur. Animals that can optimize responses for a dual challenge, i.e. simultaneous predator and pathogen attacks, will have a selective advantage. Responses to a combined predator and pathogen attack have not been well studied, but this paper summarizes the existing literature in insects. The response to dual challenges (i.e. Plan B) results in a suite of physiological changes that are different from either the stress response or the immune response, and is not a simple summation of the two. It is also not a straight-forward trade-off of one response against the other. The response to a dual challenge (i.e. Plan B) appears to resolve physiological trade-offs between the stress and immune responses, and reconfigures both responses to provide the best overall defense. However, the dual response appears to be more costly than either response occurring singly, resulting in greater damage from oxidative stress, reduced growth rate, and increased mortality.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Visual adaptations, such as superposition eyes of moths, enhance sensitivity to low light levels but trade off with spatial and temporal resolution. Conversely, apposition eyes of butterflies enable high spatial resolution but are poorly sensitive in dim light. Although diel activity patterns of insects influence visual processing, their role in evolution of visual systems is relatively unexplored. Lepidopteran insects present an excellent system to study how diel activity patterns and phylogenetic position influence the visual transduction system. We addressed this question by comparing electroretinography measurements of temporal response profiles of diverse Lepidoptera to light stimuli that were flickering at different frequencies. Our data show that the eyes of diurnal butterflies are sensitive to visual stimuli of higher temporal frequencies than nocturnal moths. Hesperiid skippers, which are typically diurnal or crepuscular, exhibit intermediate phenotypes with peak sensitivity across broader frequency range. Across all groups, species within families exhibited similar phenotypes irrespective of diel activity. Thus, Lepidopteran photoreceptors may have diversified under phylogenetic constraints, and shifts in their sensitivity to higher temporal frequencies occurred concomitantly with the evolution of diurnal lifestyles.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Workers of the remarkably polymorphic fungus-growing ant Atta cephalotes are behaviorally specialized by size: the smallest workers (minims) tend fungi in dark subterranean chambers while larger workers perform tasks outside the nest. Strong differences in worksite light conditions are predicted to influence sensory and processing requirements for vision. Analyzing confocal scans of worker eyes and brains, we found that eye structure and visual neuropils appear to have been selected to maximize task performance according to light availability. Minim eyes had few ommatidia, large interommatidial angles and eye parameter values, suggesting selection for visual sensitivity over acuity. Large workers had larger eyes with disproportionally more and larger ommatidia, and smaller interommatidial angles and eye parameter values, indicating peripheral sensory adaptation to ambient rainforest light. Optic lobes and mushroom body collars were disproportionately small in minims. Within the optic lobe, lamina and lobula relative volumes increased with worker size whereas medulla volume decreased.

For example, the energetic costs of reproduction may reduce an animal’s ability to support self-maintenance and longevity. In this work, we evaluated the impact of parity on mitochondrial physiology in laboratory mice. The theory of mitohormesis suggests that modest exposure to reactive oxygen species can improve performance, while high levels of exposure are damaging. Following this theory, we hypothesized that females that experienced one bout of reproduction (primiparous) would display improved mitochondrial capacity and reduced oxidative damage relative to non-reproductive (nulliparous) mice, while females that had four reproductive events (multiparous) would have lower mitochondrial performance and greater oxidative damage than both nulliparous and primiparous females. We observed that multiple reproductive events enhanced the mitochondrial respiratory capacity of liver mitochondria in females with high body mass. Four-bout females showed a positive relationship between body mass and mitochondrial capacity. In contrast, non-reproductive females showed a negative relationship between body mass and mitochondrial capacity and primiparous females had a slope that did not differ from zero. Other measured variables, too, were highly dependent on body mass, suggesting that a female’s body condition has strong impacts on mitochondrial physiology. We also evaluated the relationship between how much females allocated to reproduction (cumulative mass of all young weaned) and mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in the multiparous females. We found that females that allocated more to reproduction had lower basal respiration (state 4), lower mitochondrial density, and higher protein oxidation in liver mitochondria than females that allocated less. These results suggest that, at least through their first four reproductive events, female laboratory mice may experience bioenergetic benefits from reproduction but only those females that allocated the most to reproduction appear to experience a potential cost of reproduction.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Each inner ear contains three CaCO3 otolith polycrystals, which are calcified within an alkaline, K+-rich endolymph secreted by the surrounding epithelium. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, especially in marine fish. Here, we investigated the presence and cellular localization of several ion-transporting proteins within the saccular epithelium of the Pacific Chub Mackerel (Scomber japonicus). Western blotting revealed the presence of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), carbonic anhydrase (CA), Na+-K+-2Cl−-co-transporter (NKCC), vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA), plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Immunohistochemistry analysis identified two distinct ionocytes types in the saccular epithelium: Type-I ionocytes were mitochondrion-rich and abundantly expressed NKA and NKCC in their basolateral membrane, indicating a role in secreting K+ into the endolymph. On the other hand, Type-II ionocytes were enriched in cytoplasmic CA and VHA, suggesting they help transport HCO3− into the endolymph and remove H+. In addition, both types of ionocytes expressed cytoplasmic PMCA, which is likely involved in Ca2+ transport and homeostasis, as well as sAC, an evolutionary conserved acid–base sensing enzyme that regulates epithelial ion transport. Furthermore, CA, VHA, and sAC were also expressed within the capillaries that supply blood to the meshwork area, suggesting additional mechanisms that contribute to otolith calcification.

Mass feeding with 30% sugar solution successfully reduced the crop-load–sugar concentration in putative pollen foragers departing the hive, but while those bees tended to increase the crop-load volume, such increase did not fully compensate for the decreased amount of dissolved sugars in the crop load. Feeding 30% sugar solution reduced the pollen load dry weight by approx. 10–20% compared to the unfed control and to another test group fed 60% sugar solution. In addition, the pollen load size and sugar concentration of crop load remaining in returning pollen foragers was positively correlated.

These are subject to thermoregulatory control, shifting between heat conservation and dissipation, according to the animal’s needs. The three-dimensional design of the turbinate structures is essential in the sense that they determine the efficiency with which heat and water are transferred between the structure and the respired air. The turbinates have already a relatively large surface area at birth, but the structures have yet not reached the complexity of the mature animal. The aim of this study was to elucidate the structure–function relationship of the heat exchange process. We have used morphometric and physiological data from newborn reindeer calves to construct a thermodynamic model for respiratory heat and water exchange and present novel results for the simulated respiratory energy losses of calves in the cold. While the mature reindeer effectively conserves heat and water through nasal counter-current heat exchange, the nose of the calf has not yet attained a similar efficiency. We speculate that this is probably related to structure-size limitations and more favourable climate conditions during early life. The fully developed structure–function relationship may serve as inspiration for engineering design. Simulations of different extents of mucosal vascularization suggest that the abundance and pattern of perfusion of veins in the reindeer nasal mucosa may contribute to the control of temperature profiles, such that nasal cavity tissue is sufficiently warm, but not excessively so, keeping heat dissipation within limits.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Winter phenotype of small mammals living in Temperate and Boreal Zones may differ considerably from summer one in multiple traits that enhance energy conservation or diminish energy loss. However, there is a considerable variation in the development of winter phenotype among individuals in a population and some, representing the non-responding phenotype (non-responders), are insensitive to shortening days and maintain summer phenotype throughout a year. Differences in energy management associated with the development of different winter phenotypes should be accompanied by changes in antioxidant defence capacity, leading to effective protection against oxidative stress resulting from increased heat production in winter. To test it, we analysed correlation of winter phenotypes of Siberian hamsters ( Phodopus sungorus ) with facultative non-shivering thermogenesis capacity (NST) and oxidative status. We found that in both phenotypes acclimation to winter-like conditions increased NST capacity and improved antioxidant defence resulting in lower oxidative stress (OS) than in summer, and females had always lower OS than males. Although NST capacity did not correlate with the intensity of OS, shortly after NST induction responders had lower OS than non-responders suggesting more effective mechanisms protecting from detrimental effects of reactive oxygen metabolites generated during rewarming from torpor. We suggest that seasonal increase in antioxidant defence is programmed endogenously to predictively prevent oxidative stress in winter. At the same time reactive upregulation of antioxidant defence protects against reactive oxygen species generated during NST itself. It suggests that evolution of winter phenotype with potentially harmful characteristics was counterbalanced by the development of protective mechanisms allowing for the maintenance of phenotypic adjustments to seasonally changing environment.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The glucose tolerance test evaluates the individual’s ability to regulate circulating glucose levels, and is a widely used tool in medicine and biomedical research, because glucose regulation is thought to play a role in the ageing process, among other reasons. Here, we developed an application of the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IP-GTT) to be used in small birds, to test whether individuals can be characterized by their regulation of glucose levels and the effect of successive handling on such regulation. Since the IP-injection (intraperitoneal glucose injection), repeated handling and blood sampling may trigger a stress response, which involves a rise in glucose levels, we also evaluated the effects of handling protocols on glucose response. Blood glucose levels decreased immediately following an IP-injection, either vehicle or glucose loaded, and increased with successive blood sampling. Blood glucose levels peaked, on average, at 20 min post-injection (PI) and had not yet returned back to initial levels at 120 min PI.

Many studies demonstrated the role of histone acetylation in acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of long-term memory. Nonetheless, the role of histone acetylation in memory reinstatement following its disruption by antimnemonic treatments was not studied in details. In terrestrial snails, we examined effects of the histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi) sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA) on reinstatement of the context fear memory impaired by antimnemonic agents such as protein synthesis blocker anisomycin (ANI) + reminding or a specific inhibitor of protein-kinase Mζ, zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP). It was observed that both NaB and TSA applications restored the ANI-impaired context memory regardless of memory reactivation, while a combination of NaB or TSA plus memory reactivation (or additional training) was necessary for the effective reinstatement of the ZIP-impaired memory. Additionally, NaB injections significantly facilitated development of long-term memory in animals with weak memory, while no effect was observed in animals with strong memory. The data obtained confirmed the assumption that histone acetylation is a critical regulatory component of memory development and reinstatement.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hypothalamic orexins are involved in the coordination of behaviors and autonomic function. We tested whether orexins are necessary for the coordinated changes in physiological variables, which underlie torpor and represent its physiological signature. We performed simultaneous measurements of brain temperature, electroencephalographic, and electromyographic activity allowing objective assessment of wake–sleep behavior, and cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic variables in orexin knockout mice (ORX-KO) and wild-type mice (WT) during torpor bouts elicited by caloric restriction and mild cold stress. We found that torpor bouts in WT are characterized by an exquisitely coordinated physiological signature. The characteristics of torpor bouts in terms of duration and rate of change of brain temperature and electromyographic activity at torpor entrance and exit did not differ significantly between ORX-KO and WT, and neither did the cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic characteristics of torpor. ORX-KO and WT also had similar wake–sleep state changes associated with torpor bouts, with the exception of a significantly higher rapid-eye movement sleep time in ORX-KO at torpor entrance. Our results demonstrate that orexins are not necessary either for the normal physiological adaptations occurring during torpor in mice or for their coordination, suggesting that mechanisms different from orexin peptide signaling may be involved in the regulation and the coordination of these physiological responses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, many recent studies have shown that extrinsic (ecological) factors significantly affect metabolic scaling relationships, both within and among species. One of these factors is ambient temperature ( T ), but its influence on the intraspecific (ontogenetic) scaling slope ( b ) of metabolic rate varies widely. I tested whether the metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis (MLBH) can explain this variation, at least in part. The MLBH predicts that b should correlate negatively with T for resting metabolism, but show variable associations (from negative to positive) for metabolism measured during varying levels of locomotor activity. I tested the MLBH by using a literature survey of T effects on b for resting or routine metabolic rates of 179 animal and plant species. As predicted, sedentary species of ectothermic animals and plants exhibiting no locomotor activity mostly show negative associations between b and T , whereas mobile species exhibiting various low levels of uncontrolled, spontaneous, routine locomotor activity during measurements of resting or routine metabolism show varied associations. A similar difference occurs between teleost fish species exhibiting no locomotor activity versus varying levels of routine locomotor activity. These results show that intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., activity and ambient temperature, respectively) can interactively affect metabolic scaling. Metabolic scaling is highly malleable, and not the simple result of universal physical constraints.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

PCP mechanisms are responsible for the organization of hair cell morphologic polarization vectors, and are thought to be responsible for the postsynaptic expression of the calcium-binding protein calretinin that defines the utricular striola and cristae central zone. However, recent analyses revealed that subtle differences in the topographic expression of oncomodulin, another calcium-binding protein, reflects heterogeneous factors driving the subtle variations in expression. Calbindin represents a third calcium-binding protein that has been previously described to be expressed in both hair cells and afferent calyces in proximity to the utricular striola and crista central zone. The objective of the present investigation was to determine calbindin’s topographic pattern of expression to further elucidate the extent to which PCP mechanisms might exert control over the organization of vestibular neuroepithelia. The findings revealed that calbindin exhibited an expression pattern strikingly similar to oncomodulin. However, within calyces of the central zone calbindin was colocalized with calretinin. These results indicate that organizational features of vestibular epithelia are governed by a suite of factors that include PCP mechanisms as well others yet to be defined.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Energetic aspects were assessed by determining lactate, glucose and lipids levels in blood plasma, ATP, ADP and AMP levels, and AMPK phosphorylation as an indicator of regulatory changes in energy metabolism, in tissue extracts. Oxidative defence was assessed by determining superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase maximum activities. Moreover, xanthine levels were determined as an indicator of purine conversion to xanthine and associated ROS production. In the context of inflammatory response and cell death due to oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IkBα phosphorylation, IL-6 and TNFα) levels, and LC3 II/I ratio and SQSTM1/p62 as indicators of autophagic-lysosomal pathway were also determined. A recovery in the efficacy of ATP production after a marked decrease during the 1st day of exposure to 24 °C is observed. This biphasic pattern is paralleled by antioxidant enzymes’ activities and inflammatory and autophagy responses, indicating a close correlation between ATP turnover and stress responses, which may benefit tissue function and survival. However, exposure beyond 24 °C caused tissue’s antioxidant capacity loss, triggering the inflammatory and cell death response, leading to increased fish mortality.

Here, we examine baseline mobility of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. virilis, and their response to chronic exercise training. We found significant interspecific differences in mobility and in the response to exercise. Although there is a significant sex difference in exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, intraspecific analysis reveals few sex differences in other Drosophila species. As octopamine has been shown to be important for exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, we also asked if any observed differences could be attributed to baseline octopamine levels. We find that octopamine and tyramine levels have the same rank order as baseline climbing speed and endurance in males, but do not predict the response to chronic exercise in males or females. Future research should focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for the inter- and intraspecific differences in mobility and the response to exercise.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Components are individually detected by specialized olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) projecting into the macroglomerular complex (MGC) of the male brain. We asked how robust ratio recognition is when challenged by a plant volatile background. To test this, we investigated the perception of the pheromone blend in Agrotis ipsilon, a moth species whose females produce a blend of Z7-dodecenyl acetate (Z7-12:Ac), Z9-tetradecenyl acetate (Z9-14:Ac), and Z11-hexadecenyl acetate in a 4:1:4 ratio optimally attractive for males. First, we recorded the responses of specialist ORNs for Z7 and Z9 and showed that heptanal, a flower volatile, activated Z7 but not Z9 neurons. Then, we recorded intracellularly the responses of MGC neurons to various ratios and showed that heptanal altered ratio responses of pheromone-sensitive neurons. Finally, we analyzed the behavior of males in a wind tunnel and showed that their innate preference for the 4:1:4 blend was shifted in the presence of heptanal. Pheromone ratio recognition may thus be altered by background odorants. Therefore, the olfactory environment might be a selective force for the evolution of pheromone communication systems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We have studied the impact of severe hypoxia (0.5 mg O2/L) on the ionic transport across posterior gills of Carcinus maenas acclimated to 12 ppt seawater (DSW). The short-circuit current (Isc) across hemilamellae from gills i.e. active ion transport was studied in micro Ussing chambers. Hypoxia induced by deoxygenation of the basolateral side, and not the apical side, resulted in time-dependent inhibition of Isc and full recovery of Isc after reoxygenation. Exposure of the crabs to severe 7 h hypoxia decreased the specific activity of Na+,K+-ATPase in the gills by 36%. Full recovery of enzyme activity occurred in fasted crabs after 3 days of reoxygenation. The intensity of Western blotting bands was not different in the gills of oxygenated, hypoxic and reoxygenated crabs. The reversible, nonspecific blocker of K+ channels Cs and hypoxia inhibited over 90% of Isc which is after reoxygenation fully recovered. The specific blocker of Cl− channels NPPB [5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid] blocked Isc by 68.5%. Only the rest of not inhibited Isc in aerated saline was blocked by hypoxia and recovered after reoxygenation. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase was not changed during hypoxia and reoxygenation kept the high enzyme activity in the gills at the level of crabs acclimated to DSW.

The speakers were invited to represent the diversity of research that can fall under the heading of Neuroethology. Speakers were chosen for the excellence of their research, for their ability to communicate the excitement and importance of the study of behavior, and to challenge the audience to think about behavior in new and different ways. Speakers were also requested to provide an article for JCP-A. A substantial portion of the travel costs for the Presidential Symposium speakers attending the Congress was offset by Springer-Verlag as well as by the International Society for Neuroethology and a generous personal contribution from Professor Friedrich and Ortrun Barth. We hope that these contributors (and others) will continue their critical support for the Presidential Symposium in future Congresses of the International Society of Neuroethology. The symposium serves as a kick-off for the meeting and sets the tone to top-quality presentations and exciting science. Neuroethology strives to understand the neural basis of naturally occurring behavior. Understanding behavior is critical to understanding neuroscience in the context that behavior is the ultimate phenotype, the final read-out of the nervous system, and a primary target of evolution. For the uninitiated, behavior seems simple—however, modern techniques for studying behavior have shown us that the majority of behaviors have many, many degrees of freedom, and that a single behavior can serve multiple functions. In any given moment, behavior is sculpted by the nervous system, by the animals’ experience, possibly the experience of the animals’ parents and grandparents, and by the environment, and these are all impacted by the animals’ evolutionary history. Although many researchers study behavior as part of their research programs, the hallmark of a neuroethologist is a focus on behavior and how a behavior is adaptive for the organism. In studies aimed at understanding the genetic and neural bases of behavior, the key is to keep going back to the behavior under study at every step along the way, confirming that the properties of the putative underlying mechanisms match the properties of the behavior. A 2017 position paper in Neuron by Krakauer et al. was titled “Neuroscience Needs Behavior: Correcting a Reductionist Bias”, that was based on the premise that “Behavior is complex and nuanced. To really understand complexities of behavior one must see it as a meaningful endpoint and not a simple single binary unit.” To effectively study behavior, it begins with observing a simple behavior and thinking about how it can be operationally defined. Start the study using that operational definition; however, let the data refine your definition of the behavior as often as is necessary—as your understanding of the behavior grows, the definition may also evolve. Operationally defining behavior is a critical part of studying behavior. How you define the behavior will determine the results you find! Too often these days in neuroscience, the holy grail is “mechanism”, and behavior is seen as a simple observation that begins the quest for mechanism. Rarely are the mechanistic elements tested against the behavior to ensure that the features of the mechanisms (timing, intensity, frequency, etc.) match up with the parameters of the behavior. While perhaps easier to do poorly, studying behavior is at least as complicated and tricky to get right as physiology or molecular biology—for example, tossing a mouse in a Morris Water Maze and measuring time to reach the platform are not as simple as it might outwardly seem. There are many cautionary tales of drowning mice, of effects of water temperature on performance, small environmental cues unnoticed by the experimenter that the mice can use.

Mutations and deficiencies in expression of either of these proteins cause severe defects in phototransduction. Here we investigated whether these proteins are also involved in the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, phototransduction by silencing Gq α-subunit (Gqα) and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) by RNA interference and observing responses to single photons (quantum bumps, QB). We found (1) non-specific decreases in membrane resistance, membrane capacitance and absolute sensitivity in the photoreceptors of both Gqα and PLC knockdowns, and (2) small changes in QB statistics. Despite significant decreases in expressions of Gq and PLC mRNA, the changes in QB properties were surprisingly modest, with mean latencies increasing by ~ 10%, and without significant decrease in their amplitudes. To better understand our results, we used a mathematical model of the phototransduction cascade. By modifying the Gq and PLC abundances, and diffusion rates for Gq, we found that QB latencies and amplitudes deteriorated noticeably only after large decreases in the protein levels, especially when Gq diffusion was slow. Also, reduction in Gq but not PLC lowered quantum efficiency. These results suggest that expression of the proteins may be redundant.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, little attention has been paid to its physiological and biochemical characteristics that support overwintering underwater in small ponds. Here, we measured metabolic rate and heart rate, and collected liver and muscle samples from N. parkeri in summer and winter for analysis of mitochondrial respiration rate, and activities and relative mRNA transcript expression of metabolic enzymes. Compared with summer-collected frogs, both resting metabolic rate and heart rate were significantly reduced in winter-collected frogs. Both state 3 and state 4 respiration of liver mitochondria were also significantly reduced in winter but muscle mitochondria showed a decline only in state 3 respiration in winter. The activities and corresponding mRNA expression of cytochrome c oxidase showed a marked decline in winter, whereas the activities and corresponding mRNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase increased in winter-collected frogs, compared to summer. The thermal sensitivity (Q10 values) for state 3 respiration rate by liver mitochondria, and activities of lactate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase all increased in winter-collected frogs, compared with summer frogs, suggesting that overwintering frogs were more sensitive to changes in external temperature.

Many individuals exhibited circadian periods much lower (19–22 h) or much higher (26–30 h) than the archetypal circadian period. These results suggest relaxed selection on circadian period as well as an ability to succeed in nature despite a lack of circadian resonance with the 24-h daily cycle. Although displaying similar entrainment waveforms under light–dark cycles, there were remarkable differences among the three species with respect to levels of apparent masking and dispersion of activity under constant dark conditions.

This eusocial species that lives in highly ordered and hierarchical colonies with a single breeding queen, also discovered secrets enabling somewhat pain-free living around 20 million years ago. Unlike most mammals, naked mole-rats do not feel the burn of chili pepper’s active ingredient, capsaicin, nor the sting of acid. Indeed, by accumulating mutations in genes encoding proteins that are only now being exploited as targets for new pain therapies (the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA and voltage-gated sodium channel, Na V 1.7), this species mastered the art of analgesia before humans evolved. Recently, we have identified pain insensitivity as a trait shared by several closely related African mole-rat species.

Many of the impacts that this behavior can have on other species also sharing these spaces are obvious. A prime example is the devastating current extinction crisis. Yet some populations of non-human, non-domesticated species survive or even appear to thrive in heavily disturbed or human-built habitats. Theoretically, this apparent paradox could be facilitated partly by the evolution of genetically-mediated trait adaptations to the impacts of human behavior. At the least, persistence in strongly modified habitats would provide requisite selection pressures for this process to potentially occur in the future. In fact, we have a growing number of well-characterized examples of morphological trait adaptations to human behavior. However, our knowledge of genetically-mediated behavioral adaptations in similar contexts is less well developed.

To address this question, we studied the effect of 10–20 min of exposure to moderate or severe acute hypoxia (10% or 5% O 2 , respectively) on the HR of day 4 (D4) chicken embryos. In ovo, video recording of the beating embryo heart inside the egg revealed that severe, but not moderate, hypoxia resulted in significant HR changes. The HR response to severe hypoxia consisted of two phases: the first phase, consisting of an initial decrease in HR, was followed by a phase of partial HR recovery. Upon the restoration of normoxia, after an overshoot period of a few minutes, the HR completely recovered to its basal level. In vitro (isolated heart preparation), the first phase of the HR response to severe hypoxia was strengthened (nearly complete heart silencing) compared to that in ovo, and the HR recovery phase was greatly attenuated. Furthermore, neither an overshoot period nor complete HR recovery after hypoxia was observed. Thus, the D4 chicken embryo heart can partially maintain its rhythm during hypoxia in ovo, but not in vitro.

Invasive species offer opportunities to study tradeoffs that occur, with many hypotheses focusing on how immune responses vary during dispersal. The cane toad ( Rhinella marina ) is a well-known invasive species. Populations near the expanding edge of the Australian invasion have altered immune responses compared to toads from longer-established core populations, although this has not been well-documented for Florida populations. In this study, cane toads from a northern edge [New Port Richey (NPR)] and southern core (Miami) population in Florida were collected and injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to compare immune responses. Core population individuals injected with LPS showed greater metabolic increases compared to their baseline rates that were higher compared to those from the edge population. In addition, LPS-injected core individuals had different circulating leukocyte profiles compared to saline-injected cane toads while edge individuals did not. There was a significant interaction between plasma bacteria-killing capability (BKA) and treatment, such that BKA decreased with time in saline compared to LPS-injected individuals, and saline-injected toads from the edge population had lower BKA compared to LPS-injected edge toads at 20 h post-injection. There was also a significant interaction between location and time on circulating corticosterone (CORT) levels following injections with saline or LPS, with CORT decreasing more with time in core population toads. The differential CORT response indicates that differential stress responses contribute to the tradeoffs observed with immunity and dispersal.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Our earlier studies indicate that relatively few eupyrene and apyrene sperm are produced after overwintering. Although apyrene spermatogenesis occurred in young adults, eupyrene spermatogenesis did in a small scale before overwintering. These results suggest strongly that male autumnal form butterflies prepare the sperm until overwintering, which had been formed during the larval, pupal and young adult stages.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Many early-diverging fishes (e.g., hagfish and chondrichthyans) are unique in possessing plasma-accessible membrane-bound CA-IV in the gills, allowing some CO 2 excretion to occur without involvement from the RBCs. However, implications of this on RBC CA function are unclear. Through homology cloning techniques, we identified the putative protein sequences for RBC CA from nine early-diverging species. In all cases, these sequences contained a modification of the proton shuttle residue His-64, and activity measurements from three early-diverging fish demonstrated significantly reduced CA activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to restore the His-64 proton shuttle, which significantly increased RBC CA activity, clearly illustrating the functional significance of His-64 in fish red blood cell CA activity. Bayesian analyses of 55 vertebrate cytoplasmic CA isozymes suggested that independent evolutionary events led to the modification of His-64 and thus reduced CA activity in hagfish and chondrichthyans. Additionally, in early-diverging fish that possess branchial CA-IV, there is an absence of His-64 in RBC CAs and the absence of the Root effect [where a reduction in pH reduces hemoglobin’s capacity to bind with oxygen (O 2 )]. Taken together, these data indicate that low-activity RBC CA may be present in all fish with branchial CA-IV, and that the high-activity RBC CA seen in most teleosts may have evolved in conjunction with enhanced hemoglobin pH sensitivity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Ectotherms can potentially cope with stressful conditions such as extremes in temperature by exhibiting physiological plasticity. Amphibian larvae experiencing stressful environments display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits and acclimation capacity. We investigated how developmental temperature (Tdev) and altered TH levels (simulating proximate effects of environmental stress) influence the standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), and thermal tolerance in metamorphic and post-metamorphic anuran larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria) reared at five constant temperatures (14–28 °C). At metamorphosis, larvae that developed at higher temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but narrower ranges in thermal tolerance. Mean CTmax was 37.63 °C ± 0.14 (low TH), 36.49 °C ± 0.31 (control), and 36.43 °C ± 0.68 (high TH) in larvae acclimated to different temperatures. Larvae were able to acclimate to higher Tdev by adjusting their thermal tolerance, but not their SMR, and this effect was not impaired by altered TH levels. BC was reduced by 80% (metamorphic) and by 85% (post-metamorphic) at highest Tdev. The effect of stressful larval conditions (i.e., different developmental temperatures and, to some extent, altered TH levels) on SMR and particularly on BC at the onset of metamorphosis was carried over to froglets at the end of metamorphic climax. This has far reaching consequences, since body condition at metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and, thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We wondered whether the broadband information contained in these two cues could fully explain the behavior of barn owls and responses of midbrain neurons in these birds. To tackle this problem, we developed a novel approach based on head-related transfer functions. These filters contain the complete information present at the eardrum. We selected positions in space characterized by equal broadband interaural time and level differences. Stimulation from such positions provides reduced information to the owl. We show that barn owls are able to discriminate between such positions. In many cases, but not all, the owls may have used spectral components of interaural level differences that exceeded the known behavioral resolution and variability for discrimination. Alternatively, the birds may have used template matching. Likewise, neurons in the optic tectum of the barn owl, a nucleus involved in sensorimotor integration, contained more information than is available in the broadband interaural time and level differences. Thus, these data show that more information is available and used by barn owls for sound localization than carried by broadband interaural time and level differences.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

A significant reduction in body mass was observed in both feed deprivation schemes, as well as in hepatosomatic, viscerosomatic and mesenteric fat indexes. The composition of fasted fish was characterized by a decrease in lipid content; the liver displayed an intense reduction of lipid reserves in both fasted groups, and increased expression of the lysosomal acid lipase. 1 week after re-feeding, both experimental groups showed an increase in specific growth rate, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. A recovery in hepatic lipid reserves was observed, and the expression of the lysosomal acid lipase decreased, although lipid content in both groups was still significantly lower than in control groups. Hepatic expression of the growth hormone receptor decreased after fasting, and remained low even after the fish were fed, whereas the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2 increased after fasting and decreased in both groups when fish were fed again. Altogether, these results showed a partial compensatory growth response in L. guttatus juveniles after fasting, with enhanced growth rates and improved feed efficiency. Fish used stored lipid reserves as the main energy source, and the expression of growth-related and lipid mobilization marker genes in the liver showed similar patterns in both fasting schemes.

Specialization often favors species that have traits for exploiting food resources that are rare and that are not commonly shared by dietary generalists. We investigated physiological and behavioral responses to feeding between two snake species with different degrees of mammal feeding specialization: Agkistrodon contortrix (copperheads; a terrestrial species in which adults feed almost exclusively on mammals) and Agkistrodon piscivorus (cottonmouths; a semi-aquatic species feeding less on mammals and primarily on ectothermic prey). We measured metabolic rates (at 20, 25, and 30 °C) and body temperature (Tb) selection of snakes both pre- and post-feeding. Following the consumption of rodent meals, post-feeding energy use was higher in A. piscivorus than A. contortrix at both 25 and 30 °C. After feeding, A. piscivorus maintained body temperatures that were 3–4 °C higher, whereas A. contortrix remained within 1 °C of their pre-feeding Tb. Our results support the contention that dietary specialization leads to potential energetic advantages and that generalist species may change their behavior to offset energy used to digest prey.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The change from this juvenile electric organ discharges into the adult electric organ discharge takes at least a year.

Yet, guidance enshrined in legislation is narrowly derived from studies involving laboratory rodents; legitimacy for non-mammalian free-ranging species is thus debatable. The European directive 2010/63/EU illustrates this problem. It includes this key statement: “Practices not likely to cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle…” which determines if the directive shall apply. Protocols involving surgery clearly fall within the scope of the directive: procedures are scrutinized, investigators and technicians must be qualified and various agreements are required (e.g. issued by an ethical committee). By contrast, non-invasive procedures, like mark-recapture population studies, merely need a permit from wildlife authorities (at least in most countries). Yet, blood sampling that implies the introduction of a needle—one of the most common practices in animals—could shift any study on the constraining-side of the directive, on the grounds that puncture impacts individuals more severely than capture. We examined the validity of the needle-threshold using the stress response of free-ranging snakes. Our results based on physiological markers show that blood sampling does not add any stress to that triggered by capture, and thus questions the usefulness of the needle-threshold to gauge welfare in wild animals.

Hence, maintaining body temperature ( T b ) in T a below thermoneutrality can be energetically costly for a small bird. We still know little about how increased heat production below thermoneutrality affects the level at which T b is maintained, and if these patterns are age specific. To test this, we measured subcutaneous body temperature ( T s ) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) simultaneously in blue tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus ) during winter nights in T a ’s ranging from 25 to − 15 °C. RMR increased below the lower critical temperature (LCT, estimated at 14 °C) and was 6% higher in young (birds in their first winter) compared to old birds (birds in their second winter or older). The higher RMR was also mirrored in higher T s and thermal conductance ( C ) in young birds, which we suggest could be caused by age differences in plumage quality, likely driven by time constraints during moult. Reduction in nightly predicted T b was modest and increased again at the coldest ambient temperatures, suggesting that either heat retention or heat production (or both) improved when T a reached levels which are cold by the standards of birds in our population. Our results show that levels of heat production and T b can be age specific. Further studies should address age-specific differences on quality, structure, and thermal conductivity of plumage more explicitly, to investigate the role of variation in insulation in age-linked metabolic phenotypes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Recently, the first neurons likely to be involved in mantis stereopsis were described and a speculative neuronal circuit suggested. Here we further investigate classes of neurons in the lobula complex of the praying mantis brain and their tuning to stereoscopically-defined depth. We used sharp electrode recordings with tracer injections to identify visual projection neurons with input in the optic lobe and output in the central brain. In order to measure binocular response fields of the cells the animals watched a vertical bar stimulus in a 3D insect cinema during recordings. We describe the binocular tuning of 19 neurons projecting from the lobula complex and the medulla to central brain areas. The majority of neurons (12/19) were binocular and had receptive fields for both eyes that overlapped in the frontal region. Thus, these neurons could be involved in mantis stereopsis.

Growth, behavioural activities and energy contents of Pardosa saltans spiderlings’ residual vitellus were monitored during 8 days after their emergence from their egg-sac until they disperse autonomously. The life-cycle of juvenile after emergence can be divided into three periods: a gregarious while juveniles are aggregated on their mother, dismounting off their mother’s back and dispersion. We present the first biochemical study of residual vitellus and energy expenditure during these three periods. At emergence, the mean weight of juveniles was 0.59 mg and energy stock from residual vitellus averaged 51 cal/g wet mass. During gregarious period, the weight of the juveniles aggregated on their mother did not vary significantly and juveniles utilized only 1 cal/day from their residual vitellus. During the period from dismounting until their first exogenous feed, juveniles lost weight and used 30% of their residual vitellus stock. Proteins from the residual vitellus contributed principally to their energy expenditure during this period: 1.5 µg protein/day. Juveniles’ first exogenous feeding was observed 7–8 days after emergence, when 70% of residual vitellus energy had been utilized. Juveniles dispersed after eating, reconstituting an energy stock comparable to that observed at emergence from egg-sac (50 cal/g wet mass).

Previous studies in Pinnipeds have adopted relatively stationary tasks to judge tactile sensitivity, which may not accurately promote natural whisker movements and behaviours. This study developed a novel feeding task, termed fish sweeping to encourage whisker movements. Head and whisker movements were tracked from video footage in Harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina ), California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ) and Pacific walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus divergens ). All species oriented their head towards the moving fish target and moved their whiskers during the task. Some species also engaged in whisker control behaviours, including head-turning asymmetry in the Pacific walrus, and contact-induced asymmetry in the Pacific walrus and California sea lion: behaviours that have only previously been observed in terrestrial mammals. This study confirms that Pinnipeds should be thought of as whisker specialists, and that whisker control (movement and positioning) is an important aspect of touch sensing in these animals, especially in sea lions and walruses. That the California sea lion controls whisker movement in relation to an object, and also had large values of whisker amplitude, spread and asymmetry, suggests that California sea lions are a promising model with which to further explore active touch sensing.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The metamorphosis of Senegalese sole determines a migration from pelagic to benthic environments, which is accompanied by essential changes in light intensity and spectrum. In this paper, we analysed the daily expression rhythms of rod opsin and five cone opsins during sole ontogeny in animals maintained under light–dark cycles of white (LDW), blue (LDB), red (LDR) and continuous white (LL) lights. We showed that the expression of visual opsins at early stages of development was enhanced under LDB in relation to LDW, LDR and LL. Moreover, daily rhythms of opsins were more robust under LDW and LDB conditions, in particular, before and after metamorphosis. A shift in the phase of opsin rhythms was observed between hatching and pre-metamorphosis. Metamorphosis was accompanied by a transient loss in the expression rhythms for most of the opsins, which were significantly influenced by light photoperiod and spectrum. In LDR, transcript levels and rhythms were markedly affected for the majority of the opsins analysed. Under LL, most of the opsins examined exhibited endogenous rhythms, although amplitudes and acrophases changed considerably. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the daily expression rhythms of visual opsins during the ontogeny of a metamorphic flatfish and further emphasises the importance of using natural lighting conditions for proper development of Senegalese sole.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Responses of 716 units to pure tones and of 373 units to FM sweeps and FM–FM pairs were recorded extracellularly using multielectrode arrays in anesthetized bats. A general tonotopy was confirmed with low frequencies represented caudally and high frequencies represented rostrally. Characteristic frequencies (CF) ranged from 15 to 70 kHz, and fifty percent of CFs fell between 20 and 30 kHz, reflecting a hyper-representation of a bandwidth corresponding to search-phase echolocation pulses. Most units showed a stronger response to downward rather than upward FM sweeps and forty percent of the neurons interspersed throughout AC (150/371) showed echo-delay sensitivity to FM–FM pairs.

Objects can be discriminated based on luminance contrast, color contrast, and polarization contrast, and moving objects can be traced in front of moving backgrounds. Thus, various qualities are used for the identification and pursuit of conspecifics and prey, for the escape from predators, for monitoring self-movement, for maintaining orientation in space, and on a more basic level, for the entrainment of internal circadian clocks. The neuronal machinery evaluating the inputs from the eyes can be enormous and, in many species, encompasses more than three quarters of all brain neurons (Strausfeld 1976). In insects and crustaceans, primary visual processing takes place in a sequence of optic neuropils, termed lamina, medulla, and lobula complex that are retinotopically organized into layers and columns. Further processing, usually not organized retinotopically and including integration with other sensory modalities and motor control networks, involves large additional areas in the central brain and ventral nerve cord. Despite this complexity in visual signal processing, the repetitive nature of retinotopic modules in the optic lobes and the existence of individually identifiable neurons have favored arthropod, and in particular, insect visual systems as models for the analysis of visual functions at the level of single-identified neurons and neuronal networks. This special issue highlights particular areas of active research aimed at uncovering neuronal networks underlying visual functions such as motion vision, depth perception, color vision, polarization vision, and circadian clock entrainment. Owing to unique molecular genetic techniques and ongoing research toward establishing the complete connectome of the brain (Scheffer and Meinertzhagen 2019), research in these areas increasingly focusses on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This is also reflected in this special issue. Seven out of 13 articles focus on research in Drosophila. In addition, comparative studies in hoverfly, praying mantis, butterfly, grasshopper, and stomatopods elucidate neural mechanisms underlying particular visual adaptations such as target pursuit, predator approach, prey capture, and mechanisms of color vision. Neural networks underlying motion sensitivity are particularly well understood. Based on behavioral data in a beetle, Reichert and Hassenstein (1956) proposed a model for an elementary motion detection circuit in the insect brain. Research over the last 60 years largely supports this model and has now identified virtually every neuronal cell type involved in the motion vision circuitry in the fly brain. Haag and Borst (2020) summarize the current state of knowledge, provide a step-by-step guidance through the motion vision circuit, and address future directions of research, partly aimed at uncovering synaptic transmission mechanisms within the network. Research in various insect species, notably flies, bees, and locusts has shown that motion vision circuits in the optic lobe are modulated in various ways and at different levels of processing by nutritional status, current behavior, environmental changes, or novel sensory cues. Pharmacological experiments show that centrifugal neurons releasing biogenic amines, in particular serotonin and octopamine, mediate parts of these effects. Cheng and Frye (2020) review the state of knowledge on modulation of visual circuits in insects, address the limitations of current pharmacological evidence, and point out the benefits in future experiments of manipulating selected modulatory neurons in Drosophila using optogenetic tools. Feedback from large-field motion-sensitive neurons of the lobula plate on motor pathways is required in flies to control flight stability during flight maneuvers. Traditional electrophysiological studies have identified nearly 60 different types of these neurons in blowflies, but only a fraction of them in Drosophila. The paper by Wei et al.

With the discovery of the vitamins at the turn of the twentieth century, fat-soluble vitamin A was soon shown to be the essential factor. In the first half of the twentieth century, the role vitamin A plays in vision, as precursor to the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules in the photoreceptors was elegantly worked out, especially by George Wald and his colleagues. Beginning in the 1960s, with the recognition of the active metabolite of vitamin A, its acid form now called retinoic acid, the roles of vitamin A in maintaining overall health of an organism began to be explored, and this research continues to this day. Receptors activated by retinoic acid, the RARs and RXRs have been shown to regulate gene transcription in a surprisingly wide variety of biological processes from early growth and development to the maintenance of epithelial tissues in many organs, the regulation of the immune system, and even the modulation of synaptic function in the brain involved in mechanisms underlying memory and learning.

To reveal potential undiscovered traits, we tested the hypothesis that during development, when heat loss in mouse pups is high, they can use daily torpor for energy conservation. We determined at what age individual mouse pups are able to defend their body temperature at room temperature (ambient temperature, T a  = 20 °C) and whether they could use torpor from that time. Initially at 5/6 days (body mass, BM ~ 3 g), still naked mice cooled rapidly. In contrast, at ~ 14 days (BM ~ 6 g), they could maintain a high, constant body temperature and, therefore, had reached competent endothermy. These mouse pups at ~ 20% of adult BM were able to enter into and arouse from torpor as determined via the rate of oxygen consumption; this was the case for both individuals that were exposed to a cooling regime as well as those that were not. During torpor, metabolism fell by up to > 90% and torpor lasted for up to 12 h. As mice grew, torpor was still used but was less pronounced. Our study shows that although the physiology of laboratory mice has been widely examined, their functional capabilities have still not been fully revealed, which has implications for biomedicine. Our and other developmental data suggest that because torpor is so efficient in conserving energy, it is likely to be used during the growth phase by diverse mammals and birds to survive energetic and thermal challenges.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Intriguingly, when walking over hills, the ants incorporate the ground distance, the paths’ projection to the horizontal plane, into their path integrator. This review discusses how Cataglyphis may solve this computational feat. To infer ground distance, ants must incorporate the inclination of path segments into the assessment of distance. Hair fields between various joints have been eliminated as likely sensors for slope measurement, without affecting slope detection; nor do postural adaptations or changes in gait provide the relevant information. Changes in the sky’s polarization pattern due to different head inclinations on slopes were ruled out as cues. Thus, the mechanisms by which ants may measure slopes still await clarification. Remarkably, the precision of slope measurement is roughly constant up to a 45° inclination, but breaks down at 60°. An encounter of sloped path segments during a foraging trip induces a general acceptance of slopes, however, slopes are not associated with specific values of the home vector. All current evidence suggests that Cataglyphis does not compute a vector in 3-D: path integration seems to operate exclusively in the horizontal plane.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Their functional roles in the central nervous system have received less attention. The procerebrum, the secondary olfactory center of the terrestrial slug Limax, consists of several hundred thousand interneurons, and plays a pivotal role in olfactory learning and memory. In the present study, we found that enterin, known as a myoactive peptide functioning in the enteric and vascular system of Aplysia, is expressed in the procerebrum of Limax. These enterin-expressing neurons primarily make projections within the cell mass layer of the procerebrum. The oscillatory frequency of the local field potential in the procerebrum was reduced by an exogenous application of enterin. The local field potential oscillation in the tentacular ganglion, the primary olfactory center, was also modulated by enterin. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that the modulatory effect in the procerebrum was due to the inhibitory effect of enterin on the bursting neurons, which function as the kernels determining the oscillatory activity of the procerebrum. Our results revealed the novel role of the myoactive neuropeptide enterin in the higher olfactory function in terrestrial gastropods.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this comparative study, metabolic profiles of two New Zealand finfish, snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) and yellow-eyed mullet—YEM (Aldrichetta forsteri) that as juveniles share the same temperate coastal environments, were examined. Metabolic parameters (routine and maximum metabolic rates, and specific dynamic action—SDA) were investigated at a set of temperatures (13, 17, 21 °C) within the range juveniles both species experience annually. SDA was also determined for a range of different feed rations to investigate the effects of meal size on postprandial metabolic response. Temperature was a strong modulator of snapper and YEM metabolic profile (routine and maximum metabolic rates, and absolute and factorial aerobic scope). Metabolic rates increased with temperature in both species as did absolute scope in YEM, though for snapper, it was only greater at the highest temperature. Factorial scope behaved in the same fashion for the two species, being greatest at 13 °C. Both absolute and factorial scope were ~ twofold greater in YEM than in snapper across the entire temperature range. Temperature also affected SDA response in snapper, while in YEM, SDA parameters were largely unaffected when temperature increased from 17 to 21 °C. Snapper were able to consume a large range of meal sizes (0.5–3.0% body mass—BM) with meal sizes > 1% BM having a pronounced effect on numerous SDA parameters, whereas mullet appeared to consume more limited ration sizes (≤ 1.0% BM). In both species, rations ≤ 1% BM produced similar changes in SDA parameters identifying comparable digestive bio-energetics. Overall, our metabolic characterisations demonstrate that both species can adjust to the variable temperate environmental temperatures and manage the energetic costs of digestion and feed assimilation. Yet, despite these general similarities, YEM’s greater aerobic scope may point to better physiological adaptation to the highly variable temperate coastal environment than were observed in snapper.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

For example, flying insects must decide whether to pursue a prey or not, to avoid a predator, to maintain their current flight trajectory, or to land. The neural mechanisms underlying the computation of visual motion have been particularly well investigated in the fly optic lobes. However, the descending neurons, which connect the optic lobes with the motor command centers of the ventral nerve cord, remain less studied. To address this deficiency, we describe motion vision sensitive descending neurons in the hoverfly Eristalis tenax . We describe how the neurons can be identified based on their receptive field properties, and how they respond to moving targets, looming stimuli and to widefield optic flow. We discuss their similarities with previously published visual neurons, in the optic lobes and ventral nerve cord, and suggest that they can be classified as target-selective, looming sensitive and optic flow sensitive, based on these similarities. Our results highlight the importance of using several visual stimuli as the neurons can rarely be identified based on only one response characteristic. In addition, they provide an understanding of the neurophysiology of visual neurons that are likely to affect behavior.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Comparison of animals from different families, orders, and phyla reveals fascinating variation in brain morphology, circuit structure, and neural cell types. However, it can be difficult to connect the complex changes that occur across long evolutionary distances to behavior. Luckily, these changes accumulate through processes that should also be observable in recent time, making more tractable comparisons of closely related species relevant and complementary. Here, we review several decades of research on the evolution of insect olfactory circuits across short evolutionary time scales. We describe two well-studied systems, Drosophila sechellia flies and Heliothis moths, in detailed case studies. We then move through key types of circuit evolution, cataloging examples from other insects and looking for general patterns. The literature is dominated by changes in sensory neuron number and tuning at the periphery—often enhancing neural response to odorants with new ecological or social relevance. However, changes in the way olfactory information is processed by central circuits is clearly important in a few cases, and we suspect the development of genetic tools in non-model species will reveal a broad role for central circuit evolution.

We performed a proteomics analysis of N. ransonnetii plasma protein and found proteins specific to pregnant females; one of these was identified as transthyretin (TTR), a thyroid hormone distributor protein. We synthesized recombinant protein rNrTTR and raised an antibody, anti-rNrTTR, against it. Semi-quantitative analysis by western blotting using the antibody demonstrated that plasma TTR levels were significantly greater in pregnant fish than in non-pregnant fish. OCF and fetal plasma also contained high TTR levels. Immunohistochemical staining showed that large amounts of maternal TTR were taken up by fetal intestinal epithelial cells.

In turn, the concerted expression of sub-cellular effectors of ion transport underlies adaptive responses to fluctuating salinities. Exposure to seawater (SW) stimulates the expression of Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter 1 (nkcc1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (cftr) mRNAs in support of ion extrusion by SW-type ionocytes. Given the incomplete understanding of how freshwater (FW)-type ionocytes actually operate in mummichogs, the transcriptional responses essential for ion absorption in FW environments remain unresolved. In a subset of species, a ‘fish-specific’ Na+/Cl− cotransporter denoted Ncc2 (Slc12a10) is responsible for the uptake of Na+ and Cl− across the apical surface of FW-type ionocytes. In the current study, we identified an ncc2 transcript that is highly expressed in gill filaments and opercular epithelium of FW-acclimated mummichogs. Within 1 day of transfer from SW to FW, ncc2 levels in both tissues increased in parallel with reductions in nkcc1 and cftr. Conversely, mummichogs transferred from FW to SW exhibited marked reductions in ncc2 concurrent with increases in nkcc1 and cftr. Immunohistochemical analyses employing a homologous antibody revealed apical Ncc2-immunoreactivity in Na+/K+-ATPase-immunoreactive ionocytes of FW-acclimated animals.

Ultimately, calcium homeostasis is a product of relative rates of influx and efflux into the animal, but little is known regarding these processes in hagfish. Using in vitro approaches, calcium influx across gut and skin epithelia of the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, was characterised. Analysis of concentration-dependent kinetics showed that accumulation into skin tissue was linear at mucosal calcium concentrations up to 10 mM. However, movement into the serosal compartment was saturable, with a maximal transport rate of 59 nmol cm−2 h−1 and an affinity (substrate concentration to give half maximal transport rate) of 1139 µM. Calcium accumulation into gut tissue and uptake into the gut serosal compartment was also saturable, with maximal transport rates of 5.1 and 2.8 nmol cm−2 h−1, and affinities of 6417 and 3327 µM, respectively. A strong correlation between epidermal and intestinal calcium tissue uptake was noted in assays where tissues were taken from the same individual. Intestinal calcium influx was inhibited by nickel, but not significantly affected by other putative inorganic (lanthanum, zinc) or organic (diltiazem, verapamil) transport blockers.

While these changes were consistent with functional differences in cardiac performance induced by developmental hypoxia, the magnitude of this response was dwarfed by a much greater effect of development alone (76% of the total differentially abundant proteins). This means that substantial differences in relative steady-state protein expression occur in the hearts of alligators as they mature from egg-bound embryos to 2-year-old juveniles, and this developmental program is largely resistant to variation in nest conditions. We therefore performed functional enrichment analysis of the 412 DA proteins that were altered by development but not hypoxia, to gain insight into the mechanisms of cardiac maturation in this ectotherm. We found that the cardiac proteome of alligators at 90% of embryonic development retained a considerable capacity for transcription and translation, suggesting the heart was still primarily invested in growth even as the animal approached hatching. By contrast, the cardiac proteome of 2-year-old juveniles was weighted towards structural and energetic processes typical of a working heart. We discuss our results in the context of differences in cardiac development between ectothermic and endothermic oviparous vertebrates, and argue that the robust developmental program of the alligator heart reflects a slow-paced ontogeny, unburdened by the requirement to support the elevated peripheral oxygen demand typical of endothermic animals from a young age.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the temperature challenge tests, measurements were made during the first hour. In acclimated trout at all temperatures, allometric mass scaling coefficients were much higher for diffusive water flux than for MO2. Furthermore, the diffusive water flux rate was more responsive (overall Q10 = 2.75) compared to MO2 (Q10 = 1.80) over the 8–18 °C range, and for both, Q10 values were greater at 8–13 °C than at 13–18 °C. The net Na+ flux rates were highly sensitive to acclimation temperature with an overall Q10 of 3.01 for 8–18 °C. In contrast, very different patterns occurred in trout subjected to acute temperature challenges. The net Na+ flux rate was temperature-insensitive with a Q10 around 1.0. Both MO2 and diffusive water flux rates exhibited lower Q10 values than for the acclimated rates in response to either acute increases or decreases in temperature. These results fit Pattern 5 of Precht (undercompensation, reverse effect) and more precisely Pattern IIB of Prosser (reverse translation). These inverse compensatory patterns suggest that trout do not alter their rates very much when undergoing acute thermal challenges (diurnal fluctuations, migration through the thermocline). The greater changes seen with acclimation may be adaptive to long-term seasonal changes in temperature.

In the present study, we investigated the fuel adjustment in the Brazilian stingless bee Melipona subnitida (Apidae, Meliponini). Specifically, we examined whether foragers of this species increase their fuel loads when they have low expectation for nectar collection during a foraging trip. Crop load measurements revealed that nectar foragers carried significantly less fuel on departing the nest than foragers collecting either pollen, clay, or resin. Surprisingly, 75% of nectar foragers left the nest without any detectable amount of nectar, which suggests that the majority of bees collected at nearby nectar sources and avoided an increase in foraging costs. Moreover, foragers increased their fuel loading when repeatedly experiencing empty food sources that had previously been rewarding.

We found that the overlap of working intensity ranges of rods and cones is not a unique feature of lamprey short receptors, and suggest that rod-cone (possibly color) vision may be common among vertebrates. We show that the decay of meta-intermediates in lamprey cones occurs almost 100 times faster than in typical rod metarhodopsins. Rate of decay of metarhodopsins of lamprey rods take an intermediate position between typical rods and cones. This makes lamprey rhodopsin similar to transmuted cone visual pigment in “rods” of nocturnal geckos.

It has been shown in different fish species that ocean acidification (OA) mainly affects sensory systems, including olfaction. Impairment of olfactory function may be due to a dysfunction of the GABAergic system and to an alteration of neuronal plasticity in the whole brain and particularly in olfactory bulbs. Recent studies revealed that OA-driven effects on sensory systems are partly mediated by the regulation of the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission and neuronal development. However, these studies were performed in fish exposed to acidified waters for short periods, of only a few days. In the present paper, we investigated whether such effects could be observed in adult (4-years old) European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) exposed to two hypercapnic and acidified conditions (PCO2 ≈ 980 µatm; pH total = 7.7 and PCO2 ≈ 1520 µatm; pH total = 7.5) from the larval stage. In a first approach, we analyzed by qPCR the expression of five genes involved in neurogenesis (DCX) or expressed in GABAergic (Gabra3), glutamatergic (Gria1) or dopaminergic (TH and DDC) neurons in the olfactory bulbs. The tested experimental conditions did not change the expression of any of the five genes.

There are a number of factors which alter an organism’s calcium balance, such as growth, aging, physical inactivity and acquired or inherited disorders which ultimately lead to bone loss. In non-hibernating mammals, physical inactivity causes bone loss which may not be completely recoverable during the lifespan of an individual despite a resumption of activity. Extreme physical inactivity and nutritional deprivation are two other important factors that lead to bone loss in non-hibernating mammals. The mechanism of bone loss is still poorly understood, however, there is some evidence which shows that during hibernation, smaller mammals (ground squirrels, bats, and hamsters) undergo bone loss. While on the other hand, hibernating bears do not show any sign of bone loss and retain their bone structure and strength. This may be due to differences in their hibernation patterns, as smaller mammals may excrete calcium throughout the hibernation period, which ultimately leads to bone loss, whereas bears seem to have a more developed and advanced mechanism to prevent calcium loss and maintain their bone structure. In this review, we summarize calcium homeostasis and its adaptive mechanisms with reference to bone loss in hibernating as compared to non-hibernating mammals.

Functional and structural study of aorta showed that a selection for divergent BMR resulted in the between-line difference in diastolic aortic capacity. The relaxation was stronger in aorta of the HBMR mice, which may stem from greater flexibility of aorta mediated by higher activity of Ca 2+ -activated K + channels. Structural examination also indicated that HBMR mice had significantly thicker aorta's middle layer compared to LBMR animals.

We assessed the contractile responsiveness of uteri from the squamate viviparous-oviparous species pair, Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii and Lampropholis guichenoti , as well as the bimodally reproductive species, Saiphos equalis , to arginine vasopressin (AVP). We assessed the resulting uterine contractility as a function of pregnancy status, species and parity mode. We also measured mRNA abundance for the nonapeptide receptor, oxytocin receptor ( oxtr ), in uteri from P. entrecasteauxii and L. guichenoti and compared expression across pregnancy status and parity mode. We found that pregnant uteri exhibited a significantly greater contractile response to AVP than non-pregnant uteri in all three lizard species studied. Cross-species comparisons revealed that uteri from viviparous P. entrecasteauxii were significantly more responsive to AVP than uteri from oviparous L. guichenoti during both pregnant and non-pregnant states. Conversely, for non-pregnant S. equalis , uteri from viviparous individuals were significantly less responsive to AVP than uteri from oviparous individuals, while during pregnancy, there was no difference in AVP contractile responsiveness. There was no difference in expression of oxtr between L. guichenoti and P. entrecasteauxii , or between pregnant and non-pregnant individuals within each species. We found no significant correlation between oxtr expression and AVP contractile responsiveness. These findings indicate that there are differences in nonapeptide signalling across parity mode and suggest that in these lizards, labour may be triggered either by an increase in plasma nonapeptide concentration, or by an increase in expression of a different nonapeptide receptor from the vasopressin-like receptor family.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Energy is required for maintenance, swimming, the development of gonads and secondary sexual characters and spawning and post-spawning activities. Plasma and muscle metabolites were measured in animals subjected to an exercise-recovery regime at the commencement and completion of the spawning run. The present study demonstrated the following. At all stages of the migration, plasma glucose and glycerol concentrations increased during exercise and then declined, whereas plasma FFAs exhibited the reverse trend. During exercise and recovery, alanine declined and ammonia increased in the plasma of early migrants, while the opposite occurred in mature males. Following exercise, muscle alanine rose and then declined in early migrants, but declined and then rose in mature males. The composite data emphasise that, while the same catabolic processes are employed by both sexes early in the migration, when animals are immature, they differ markedly between the sexes as they mature and then spawn, reflecting their different demands. Energy is supplied predominantly via anaerobic metabolism in early migrants, but by anaerobic and aerobic metabolism in prespawning females and by aerobic metabolism in mature males and spent females. Although proteolysis is limited early in the migration, it is employed extensively during maturation and particularly by females, which undergo a substantial reduction in length in the lead-up to spawning.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Nocturnal insects tend to have intrinsically more sensitive and larger rhabdomeres than diurnal species. However, large rhabdomeres have relatively high membrane capacitance ( C m ), which can strongly low-pass filter the voltage bumps, widening and attenuating them. To investigate the evolution of photoreceptor signaling under near dark, we recorded elementary current and voltage responses from a number of species in six insect orders. We found that the gain of phototransduction increased with C m , so that nocturnal species had relatively large and prolonged current bumps. Consequently, although the voltage bump amplitude correlated negatively with C m , the strength of the total voltage signal increased. Importantly, the background voltage noise decreased strongly with increasing C m , yielding a notable increase in signal-to-noise ratio for voltage bumps. A similar decrease in the background noise with increasing C m was found in intracellular recordings in vivo. Morphological measurements of rhabdomeres were consistent with our C m estimates. Our results indicate that the increased photoreceptor C m in nocturnal insects is a major sensitivity-boosting and noise-suppressing adaptation. However, by requiring a compensatory increase in the gain of phototransduction, this adaptation comes at the expense of the signaling bandwidth.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The rms values and their significance for threshold determination depended strongly on the filtering of the signal. Using the minimum threshold values obtained at three different low-frequency filter corner frequencies (30, 100, 300 Hz), ABR threshold curves were calculated. The course of the ABR thresholds was comparable to that of published DPOAE (distortion-product otoacoustic emission) thresholds based on a − 10 dB SPL threshold criterion for the 2f1–f2 emission (Schlenther et al. in J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 15:695–705, 2014, frequency range 10–90 kHz). For frequencies between 20 and 80 kHz, which is the most sensitive part of the bat’s audiogram, median thresholds ranged between 10 and 28 dB SPL, and the DPOAE thresholds ranged between 10 and 23 dB SPL. At frequencies below 20 kHz (5–20 kHz) and above 80 kHz (80–120 kHz), ABR thresholds increased by 20 dB/octave and 45 dB/octave, respectively.

The present study characterizes major ionic currents (I Na , I CaL , I Kr , I K1 and I KACh ) and action potential (AP) configuration in cardiomyocytes from the ventricle, the right atrium and the sinus venosus (SV) of Burmese pythons ( Python molurus ) using sharp microelectrode and patch clamp recordings. Special attention was given to SV, since it consists of myocardial cells and appears to contribute to right atrial filling in snakes. We demonstrate that most of the SV in pythons has a stable resting potential of − 82.3 ± 2.6 mV ( n  = 9) and lacks pacemaker activity. AP duration at 50% repolarization was similar in cells from SV and atria (350.2 ± 8.7 and 330.4 ± 17.2 ms, respectively; n  = 7), but shorter than ventricular APs (557.6 ± 19.2 ms, n  = 5) at 30 °C. The densities of ionic currents, however, differed substantially between atrial and SV cells, where the latter had much lower densities of I Na , I CaL and I Kr than atrial and ventricular myocytes. I K1 in ventricle was ninefold greater than in atrial cells and 23-fold greater than in myocytes from SV. However, I KACh was absent in ventricular cells, while it was equally large in atrial and SV myocytes. Consistent with this observation, APs of atrium and SV, but not ventricle, were greatly shortened upon addition of acetylcholine (10 −6  M).

Its eyes are furnished with eight spectral classes of photoreceptors, situated in three types of ommatidia, randomly distributed in the retinal mosaic. Here, we investigated early chromatic information processing by recording spectral, angular, and polarization sensitivities of photoreceptors and lamina monopolar cells (LMCs). We identified three spectral classes of LMCs whose spectral sensitivities corresponded to weighted linear sums of the spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors present in the three ommatidial types. In ~ 25% of the photoreceptor axons, the spectral sensitivities differed from those recorded at the photoreceptor cell bodies. These axons showed spectral opponency, most likely mediated by chloride ion currents through histaminergic interphotoreceptor synapses. The opponency was most prominent in the processes of the long visual fibers in the medulla. We recalculated the wavelength discrimination function using the noise-limited opponency model to reflect the new spectral sensitivity data and found that it matched well with the behaviorally determined function. Our results reveal opponency at the first stage of Papilio’s visual system, indicating that spectral information is preprocessed with signals from photoreceptors within each ommatidium in the lamina, before being conveyed downstream by the long visual fibers and the LMCs.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To investigate whether ultradian oscillations in brain temperature had thermoregulatory consequences for the sheep, we determined the cranial arterio-venous (AV) temperature difference as an indicator of respiratory evaporative heat loss (REHL). The 24-h pattern of SBC was similar in both environments, despite carotid blood temperature fluctuating 0.4 °C more outdoors compared to indoors. The sheep employed SBC more often during the night than during the day, but SBC was abolished at intervals of 1–3 h throughout the 24-h period. The suppression of SBC appeared to be associated with events that increased sympathetic nervous system activity, including shifts between stages of sleep. Short-term changes (over 5-min) in brain temperature were positively correlated with changes in the AV temperature difference 5 min later, and negatively correlated with changes in carotid temperature 10 min later. These data support the idea that increases in brain temperature modulate thermoregulation by increasing REHL, which leads to a decrease in carotid blood temperature. Ultradian oscillations in core temperature of sheep, therefore, appear to arise as a consequence of frequent brain temperature changes invoked by non-thermal inputs, in animals housed both in indoor and outdoor environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We used in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in response to monochromatic light stimuli ranging from 300 to 650 nm with 25-nm steps. We characterized the chromatic response of 33 higher visual neurons, including their general response type and their wavelength tuning. Color-opponent-type responses that had been typically observed in primates and bees were not identified. Instead, the majority of neurons showed excitatory responses to broadband wavelengths. The UV (300–375 nm) and middle wavelength (425–575 nm) ranges could be separated at the population level owing to neurons that preferentially responded to a specific wavelength range.

The Drosophila visual system, for instance, splits information into channels with different temporal properties directly downstream of photoreceptors in the first-order interneurons of the OFF pathway, L2 and L3. However, the biophysical mechanisms that determine this specialization are largely unknown. Here, we show that the voltage-gated Ka channels Shaker and Shal contribute to the response properties of the major OFF pathway input L2. L3 calcium response kinetics postsynaptic to photoreceptors resemble the sustained calcium signals of photoreceptors, whereas L2 neurons decay transiently. Based on a cell-type-specific RNA-seq data set and endogenous protein tagging, we identified Shaker and Shal as the primary candidates to shape L2 responses. Using in vivo two-photon imaging of L2 calcium signals in combination with pharmacological and genetic perturbations of these Ka channels, we show that the wild-type Shaker and Shal function is to enhance L2 responses and cell-autonomously sharpen L2 kinetics.

Males exhibit high nest fidelity, making them susceptible to anthropogenic sound in coastal waters, which could mask their vocalizations and/or reduce auditory sensitivity levels. Additionally, the effect of self-generated boatwhistles on toadfish auditory sensitivity has yet to be addressed.

The physiological and behavioral states that elicit neuromodulation of motion vision include locomotion, changes in internal physiological state such as hunger, and changes in the external environment such as the presence of additional sensory cues. The direction of influence between these states and neuromodulators remains unknown. The influence of neuromodulators on motion vision circuitry has been revealed mostly through pharmacological application, which broadcasts widely with unnatural spatiotemporal dynamics. Thus, insight from this method is limited. Aminergic neurons likely act in local hierarchical fashion rather than globally as a group.

However, the relationship between the physiological and behavioral responses is still a complex issue in vertebrates. We evaluate the effects of an experimental manipulation of glucocorticoid levels on the generation of the behavioral and physiological response to stress by predation in the subterranean rodent C. talarum. We found that when tuco-tucos encountered predator cues—fur odor, and largely, immobilization—they responded physiologically by secreting cortisol. This response was accompanied by an associated behavioral response. However, when the increase in plasma cortisol originated exogenously by the injection of cortisol, a behavioral response was not observed. Finally, inhibition of glucocorticoids’ synthesis was effective in weakening the behavioral effects produced by immobilization.

We administered the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole prior to song exposure and measured Egr-1 across several auditory regions. Fadrozole attenuated Egr-1 in the auditory cortex greater in males than females. Females had greater expression and clustering of aromatase cells than males in high vocal center (HVC) shelf. Auditory-induced Egr-1 expression exhibited a large sex difference following fadrozole treatment. We did not observe changes in pCREB expression with song presentation or aromatase blockade.

Functional network analysis indicated that L. polyactis adapted to cold stress by employing a series of mechanisms to minimize damages caused by exposure to cold temperatures. The molecular mechanisms identified through RNA-Seq included Extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, glycerolipid metabolism, regulation of autophagy and focal adhesion pathway as playing vital roles in cold tolerance in L. polyactis.

In the current study, seasonal changes in hematological parameters and cytokines in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) were examined to test the winter immunoenhancement hypothesis, which states that immune function tends to increase in fall and winter compared with other seasons. Male and female hamsters were captured from the wild in the fall and winter of 2014 and in the spring and summer of 2015. Maximum body mass in both sexes and relative fatness in female hamsters occurred in the summer, indicating that body condition was the best during this season. All hematological parameters were not different between male and female hamsters, and were also not affected by the interaction of season and sex except neutrophil granulocytes (GRAN). Red blood cells (RBC) and haematocrit (PCV) were higher in the fall and winter, and hemoglobin concentration (HGB) was the highest in winter in hamsters compared with the spring and summer, implying that their oxygen-carrying capacity and oxygen affinity of the blood increased during these seasons. Compared with other seasons, the number of white blood cells (WBC) was higher in winter than in summer, intermediate granulocytes (MID), the percent of MID (MID%), GRAN and the percent of GRAN (GRAN%) were the highest in winter, which all supported the winter immunoenhancement hypothesis. However, the count of lymphocytes (LYMF) was the highest in spring, being inconsistent with this hypothesis. IL-2 levels, but not TNF-α, were influenced by seasons, sex and their interaction in hamsters. Regardless of sex, IL-4 titres were higher in spring and summer than in fall and winter in hamsters. INF-γ titres in male hamsters did not differ between the spring and summer, while its titres in female hamsters was lower in spring in contrast with winter and summer.

Variation in stress-related costs may also depend on the environment—costs can be facultative and only occur when resources are limited, or they may be obligate and occur regardless of resource availability. Dynamics of oxidative stress may be important in life-history evolution given their role in a range of biological processes—from reproduction to immunity to locomotion. Thus, we examined how resource (food) availability influences the costs of oxidative challenge to fitness-related traits spanning several levels of biological organization. We manipulated food availability and oxidative status in females of the wing-dimorphic sand field cricket ( Gryllus firmus ) during early adulthood. We then determined investment into several traits: reproduction (ovary mass), soma (body mass and flight musculature), and immune function (total phenoloxidase activity). Oxidative challenge (paraquat exposure) obligated costs to somatic tissue and a parameter of immune function regardless of food availability, but it did not affect reproduction. We show that the costs of oxidative challenge are trait-specific, but we did not detect a facultative (food-dependent) cost of oxidative challenge to any trait measured. Although the dynamics of oxidative stress are complex, our study is an important step toward a more complete understanding of the roles that resource availability and redox systems play in mediating life histories.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In dipteran flies, visual feedback is provided by the wide-field motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system called lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs). Understanding the role of LPTCs in fly behaviors can address many fundamental questions on how sensory circuits guide behaviors. The blowfly was estimated to have ~ 60 LPTCs, but only a few have been identified in Drosophila. We conducted a Gal4 driver screen and identified five LPTC subtypes in Drosophila, based on their morphological characteristics: LPTCs have large arborizations in the lobula plate and project to the central brain. We compared their morphologies to the blowfly LPTCs and named them after the most similar blowfly cells: CH, H1, H2, FD1 and FD3, and V1. We further characterized their pre- and post-synaptic organizations, as well as their neurotransmitter profiles. These anatomical features largely agree with the anatomy and function of their likely blowfly counterparts. Nevertheless, several anatomical details indicate the Drosophila LPTCs may have more complex functions. Our characterization of these five LPTCs in Drosophila will facilitate further functional studies to understand their roles in the visual circuits that instruct fly behaviors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Importance of cardiac control and coronary perfusion for heat tolerance in rainbow trout,"Coronary perfusion and cardiac autonomic regulation may benefit myocardial oxygen delivery and thermal performance of the teleost heart, and thus influence whole animal heat tolerance. Yet, no study has examined how coronary perfusion affects cardiac output during warming in vivo. Moreover, while β-adrenergic stimulation could protect cardiac contractility, and cholinergic decrease in heart rate may enhance myocardial oxygen diffusion at critically high temperatures, previous studies in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using pharmacological antagonists to block cholinergic and β-adrenergic regulation showed contradictory results with regard to cardiac performance and heat tolerance. This could reflect intra-specific differences in the extent to which altered coronary perfusion buffered potential negative effects of the pharmacological blockade. Here, we first tested how cardiac performance and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) were affected following a coronary ligation. We then assessed how these performances were influenced by pharmacological cholinergic or β-adrenergic blockade, hypothesising that the effects of the pharmacological treatment would be more pronounced in coronary ligated trout compared to trout with intact coronaries. Coronary blockade reduced CTmax by 1.5 °C, constrained stroke volume and cardiac output across temperatures, led to earlier cardiac failure and was associated with reduced blood oxygen-carrying capacity. Nonetheless, CTmax and the temperatures for cardiac failure were not affected by autonomic blockade. Collectively, our data show that coronary perfusion improves heat tolerance and cardiac performance in trout, while evidence for beneficial effects of altered cardiac autonomic tone during warming remains inconclusive.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

For over 50 years the focus has been on gonadal steroid production by male fetuses and the impact on developing brain. An increasing awareness of the importance of sex chromosome complement has broadened the focus but identifying specific roles in development has yet to be achieved. Recent emphasis on transcriptomics has revealed myriad and unexpected differences in gene expression in specific regions of male and female brains which may produce sex differences, serve a compensatory role or provide latent sex differences revealed only in response to challenge. More surprising, however, has been the consistent observation of a central role for inflammatory signaling molecules and immune cells in masculinization of brain and behavior. The signal transduction pathways and specific immune cells vary by brain region, as does the neuroanatomical substrate subject to differentiation, reflecting substantial complexity emerging from what may be a common origin, the maternal immune system.

A recent comparative analysis showed that the structure of brains of wasps in the family Vespidae differed between solitary and social species: the mushroom bodies, a major integrative brain region, were larger relative to brain size in the solitary species. However, the earlier study did not account for body size effects, and species’ relative mushroom body size increases with body size in social Vespidae. Here we extend the previous analysis by measuring the effects of body size variation on brain structure differences between social and solitary vespid wasps. We asked whether total brain volume was greater relative to body size in the solitary species, and whether relative mushroom body size was greater in solitary species, after accounting for body size effects. Both total brain volume and relative mushroom body volume were significantly greater in the solitary species after accounting for body size differences. Therefore, body size allometry did not explain the solitary versus social species differences in brain structure. The evolutionary transition from solitary to social behavior in Vespidae was accompanied by decreases in total brain size and in relative mushroom body size.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It is hypothesized that bats are evolved from small insectivorous mammals. Therefore, the digestive and metabolic systems of phytophagous and insectivorous bats must have evolved differently to adapt to their dietary habits. To investigate the difference in sugar tolerance in bats, we determined changes in blood glucose levels after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of glucose in three species of phytophagous and four species of insectivorous bats under resting conditions. Results showed that phytophagous bats eliminated blood glucose faster than insectivorous bats. All three species of fruit bats reduced blood glucose to fasting levels within 30–45 min, whereas all insectivorous bats failed to lower blood glucose to fasting levels even 120 min after i.p. glucose injection.

Fictive singing, with sensory feedback removed, was elicited by eserine-microinjection into the brain, and the motor activity underlying singing and abdominal ventilation was recorded with extracellular electrodes. During singing, expiratory abdominal muscle activity is tightly phase coupled to the chirping pattern. Occasional temporary desynchronization of the two motor patterns indicate discrete central pattern generator (CPG) networks that can operate independently. Intracellular recordings revealed a sub-threshold depolarization in phase with the ventilatory cycle in a singing-CPG interneuron, and in a ventilation-CPG interneuron an excitatory input in phase with each syllable of the chirps. Inhibitory synaptic inputs coupled to the syllables of the singing motor pattern were present in another ventilatory interneuron, which is not part of the ventilation-CPG. Our recordings suggest that the two centrally generated motor patterns are coordinated by reciprocal feedforward discharges from the singing-CPG to the ventilation-CPG and vice versa. Consequently, expiratory contraction of the abdomen usually occurs in phase with the chirps and ventilation accelerates during singing due to entrainment by the faster chirp cycle.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In all animals, the eyes are the main visual organs that are not only responsible for motion and colour (image) vision, but also transfer light information to the circadian clock in the brain. The way in which light entrains the circadian clock appears, however, variable in different species. As do vertebrates, insects possess extraretinal photoreceptors in addition to their eyes (and ocelli) that are sometimes located close to (underneath) the eyes, but sometimes even in the central brain. These extraretinal photoreceptors contribute to entrainment of their circadian clocks to different degrees. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is special, because it expresses the blue light-sensitive cryptochrome (CRY) directly in its circadian clock neurons, and CRY is usually regarded as the fly’s main circadian photoreceptor. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the retinal and extraretinal eyes transfer light information to almost every clock neuron and that the eyes are similarly important for entraining the fly’s activity rhythm as in other insects, or more generally spoken in other animals.

Moreover, submissive behaviors have been generally overlooked. We focused on agonistic behavior between males of the cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus, in dyadic encounters held in a novel context after being fed or not with an l-tryptophan enriched diet (TRP) for 2 weeks. We arranged three different dyads: control/control (control conditions: not TRP enriched), control/TRP, and TRP/TRP. We also registered the response of the brain serotonergic system in four brain regions. TRP/TRP dyads showed higher latencies to first attack, lower overall aggression, and lower proportions of bites and passive copings (submissive display) compared to control/control. TRP dominant males performed fewer bites with respect to controls, and subordinate males opposed to TRP males showed fewer passive copings. Higher serotonergic activities were found in subordinates’ optic tectum and in the telencephalon and preoptic area/hypothalamus of TRP males. Altogether, results point out that dietary l-tryptophan reduced males’ motivation to attack and dominant aggression, which consequently influenced subordinate agonistic repertory. In addition, males within TRP/TRP dyads showed a switch in their behavioral agonistic repertory. These behavioral outcomes were probably due to modifications at brain serotonergic functioning.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, at the level of individual photoreceptors, the direction in which the image is shifting is not explicitly represented. Rather, directional motion information needs to be extracted from the photoreceptor array by comparing the signals of neighboring units over time. The exact nature of this process as implemented in the visual system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been studied in great detail, and much progress has recently been made in determining the neural circuits giving rise to directional motion information. The results reveal the following: (1) motion information is computed in parallel ON and OFF pathways. (2) Within each pathway, T4 (ON) and T5 (OFF) cells are the first neurons to represent the direction of motion. Four subtypes of T4 and T5 cells exist, each sensitive to one of the four cardinal directions. (3) The core process of direction selectivity as implemented on the dendrites of T4 and T5 cells comprises both an enhancement of signals for motion along their preferred direction as well as a suppression of signals for motion along the opposite direction. This combined strategy ensures a high degree of direction selectivity right at the first stage where the direction of motion is computed. (4) At the subsequent processing stage, tangential cells spatially integrate direct excitation from ON and OFF-selective T4 and T5 cells and indirect inhibition from bi-stratified LPi cells activated by neighboring T4/T5 terminals, thus generating flow-field-selective responses.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In comparison with the wild-type Canton-S (CS) males, six characteristics of the phenotype of Dgp-1[843k] mutant were found: (1) low expression of isoform A; (2) augmented expression of isoform B; (3) reduction in the mean lifespan; (4) decrease in the running speed in 3-day-old flies; (5) maintenance of a high run frequency in senescent flies; and (6) resistance to heat stress manifested as maintenance of a high run frequency at 29 °C. After cessation of “cantonization” process, mean lifespan of the mutant males drifted from low to high values finally exceeding that for CS. In contrast, behavioral phenotype of the mutant was robust. Using the GAL4/UAS system, we showed that neurospecific overexpression of isoform B resulted in a slight decrease of longevity and a high level of run frequency in the senescent flies, similar to that in Dgp-1[843K] mutant. In addition, a decreased level of reactive oxygen species was found in Dgp-1[843K] mutant males maintained under stress conditions.

Greatest sensitivity was observed at the lower and upper ends of the tested frequency range. To evaluate the relative contributions of the lateral line and inner ear, we measured the effects of neomycin on EP response characteristics at 40 Hz, and used the vital dye DASPEI to verify neuromast ablation. Neomycin increased the latency of the EP response up until 60 min post-treatment. DASPEI results confirmed that neuromast hair cell death was significant in treated fish over this timeframe. These results indicate that the inner ear, whether it is sound pressure or particle motion detection, makes a significant contribution to the dipole-induced EP in blind cavefish at near-field low frequencies where the lateral line contribution would be expected to be strongest. The results from this study imply that under some circumstances, lateral line function could be complemented by the inner ear.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Kir2 composition in the polar cod was more diverse than in other species in that all Kir2 isoforms were relatively highly expressed. Kir2 composition of navaga and burbot differed from that of the polar cod as well as from those of other species. The relative expression of Kir2.2 transcripts, especially Kir2.2b, was higher in both atrium and ventricle of navaga and burbot (56–89% from the total Kir2 pool) than in other species (0.1–11%). Thermal acclimation induced only small changes in cardiac Kir2 transcript expression in Gadiformes species. However, Kir2.2b transcripts were upregulated in cold-acclimated navaga and burbot hearts.

Sexual dimorphism of auditory systems has been reported in several species of vertebrates, but little is known about this phenomenon in turtles. Some morphological characteristics, such as middle ear and tympanic membrane that influence the hearing sensitivity of animals can result in hearing sexual dimorphism. To examine whether sexual dimorphism in hearing sensitivity occurs in turtles and to compare hearing characteristics with respect to the shape of the tympanic membrane, we measured the hearing sensitivity and tympanum diameter in both sexes of Trachemys scripta elegans. The results showed that, with the exception of 0.9 kHz, auditory brainstem response thresholds were significantly lower in females than in males for frequencies in the 0.2–1.1 kHz range, indicating that the hearing of females shows greater sensitivity. No significant differences were detected in the tympanum diameter of both sexes.

This study investigates the rate that myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition matures in a postural and locomotor skeletal muscle for four pinniped species with different lactation lengths: hooded seals, Cystophora cristata; harp seals, Pagophilus groenlandicus; northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus, and Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus. The ontogeny of MHC isoform expression was compared with developmental rates of myoglobin concentrations, and aerobic (citrate synthase, β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) and anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) enzyme activities. Within taxonomic families, species with shorter lactation periods had more mature muscles biochemically at birth, and fiber types differentiated earlier during ontogeny (Phocidae: hooded > harp seals, Otariidae: northern fur seals > Steller sea lions). Northern fur seal neonates had the most phenotypically-mature muscles in this study, with no immature MHC isoforms. The relationship between muscle biochemistry and MHC composition became more pronounced with age, and developed to reflect swimming mode and activity levels. In adults, phocids had more slow-twitch oxidative protein in their primary locomotor muscle, the Longissimus dorsi (LD), than otariids which likely reflects oxygen-sparing strategies for the phocids’ longer dives. Conversely, northern fur seal muscles had higher proportions of fast-twitch MHCs in the Pectoralis and LD, likely indicative of this species’ smaller size and higher mass-specific metabolic rates. Thus, muscle phenotype is linked with species life history, and a mismatch between muscle biochemistry and MHC composition at weaning has important implications for the first year of independent foraging in pinniped pups.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, the complete coding cDNA sequence of a homolog of voltage-gated calcium channel subunit α1 (CACNA1), which is the pore-forming subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), was obtained from the ctenidium (gill) of the giant clam, Tridacna squamosa. It consisted of 6081 bp and encoded a 223 kDa polypeptide with 2027 amino acids, which was characterized as the α1D subunit of L-type VGCC. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that CACNA1 had an apical localization in the epithelial cells of filaments and tertiary water channels in the ctenidium of T. squamosa, indicating that it was well positioned to absorb exogenous Ca2+. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the protein abundance of CACNA1 in the ctenidium of individuals exposed to light for 12 h. With more pore-forming CACNA1, there could be an increase in the permeation of exogenous Ca2+ into the ctenidial epithelial cells through the apical membrane.

Maskers were on-frequency bandlimited noise or low-frequency noise of frequencies 0.25–1 oct below the stimulus frequency.

In this study, telemeters that measure arterial pressure were implanted into male and female C57Bl/6J mice. These mice were trained to voluntarily dive underwater for a distance of 40 cm over a 4–6 s period. Just before the dive, the interbeat interval (IBI) was 87 ± 6 ms (mean ± SD) and diastolic pressure was 99 ± 14 mmHg. Underwater submersion caused (1) a dramatic bradycardia immediately at the onset of each dive, as IBI increased to 458 ± 104 ms, and (2) a large drop in diastolic pressure, to 56 ± 16 mmHg despite the elevation in peripheral resistance. Mice experienced a short bout (~ 2 s) of hypertension (diastolic pressure rose to 131 ± 17 mmHg) upon emergence.

Progressively increasing levels of CO2 mixed with air were injected into the air-breathing organ (ABO) of one group of intact fish to elevate internal PCO2 and decrease blood pH. Another group of fish in which the gills were totally denervated was exposed to aquatic hypercarbia (pH ~ 6) or arterial hypercapnia in aquatic normocarbia (by injection of acetazolamide to increase arterial PCO2 and decrease blood pH). Air-breathing frequency, gill ventilation frequency, heart rate and arterial PCO2 and pH were recorded during all treatments. The CO2 injections into the ABO induced progressive increases in air-breathing frequency, but did not alter gill ventilation or heart rate. Exposure to both hypercarbia and acetazolamide post-denervation of the gills also produced significant air-breathing responses, but no changes in gill ventilation. While all treatments produced increases in arterial PCO2 and decreases in blood pH, the modest changes in arterial PCO2/pH in the acetazolamide treatment produced the greatest increases in air-breathing frequency. These results strengthen the evidence that internal CO2/H+ sensing is involved in the stimulation of air breathing in clown knifefish and suggest that it involves extra-branchial chemoreceptors possibly situated either centrally or in the air-breathing organ.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) has recently been adopted as a stress marker, but there is little investigation of its relationship to glucocorticoids (GC), well-known indicators of stress. This study examined the influence of age, reproductive state and environment on GC and DHEAS levels in orangutans, to test whether the GC/DHEAS ratio can provide an index of stress response in primates. We measured fecal GC (fGC) and fecal DHEAS (fDHEAS) concentrations in 7 captive orangutans from zoological parks in Japan and 22 wild orangutans from Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysia. We found that in a stressful condition (transportation), fDHEAS levels increased 2 days after the fGC response, which occurred 1 day after the stressor. One pregnant female had elevated levels of both hormones, and a higher fGC/fDHEAS ratio than baseline. Females in the first year of lactation had fGC levels and the fGC/fDHEAS ratio significantly higher than both baseline and females in the second and subsequent years of lactation. There was no effect of age on fGC levels, but the fGC/fDHEAS ratio was higher in infants than adults and adolescents. fDHEAS concentrations were lower in infants than juveniles, adolescents and adults, a phenomenon known as adrenarche, shared with humans and other great apes. We suggest that changes in DHEAS during orangutan life history are associated with changes in the dynamics of maintaining homeostasis that vary with age and reproductive state. The GC/DHEAS ratio index is useful to evaluate age-related abilities of responding to stressful challenges.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The development of acoustic alerting technologies to deter eagles from entering hazardous air spaces is a potentially significant mitigation strategy to diminish associated morbidity and mortality risks. As a prelude to the engineering of deterrence technologies, auditory function was assessed in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), as well as in red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis). Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to a comprehensive battery of clicks and tone bursts varying in level and frequency were acquired to evaluate response thresholds, as well as suprathreshold response characteristics of wave I of the ABR, which represents the compound potential of the VIII cranial nerve. Sensitivity curves exhibited an asymmetric convex shape similar to those of other avian species, response latencies decreased exponentially with increasing stimulus level and response amplitudes grew with level in an orderly manner. Both species were responsive to a frequency band at least four octaves wide, with a most sensitive frequency of 2 kHz, and a high-frequency limit of approximately 5.7 kHz in bald eagles and 8 kHz in red-tailed hawks.

We tested the hypothesis that ageing influences the scope for phenotypic flexibility in the mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), an amphibious fish that transitions between two vastly different environments, water and land. We found that older fish (4–6 years old) exhibited marked signs of ageing; older fish were reproductively senescent, had reduced fin regenerative capacity and body condition, and exhibited atrophy of both oxidative and glycolytic muscle fibers relative to younger adult fish (1–2 years old). However, age did not affect routine O2 consumption. We then acclimated adult fish (1–6 years) to water (control) or air for 10 days to assess the scope for phenotypic flexibility in response to terrestrial exposure. In support of our hypothesis, we found that older air-acclimated fish had a diminished scope for gill remodeling relative to younger fish. We also found that older fish exhibited poorer terrestrial locomotor performance relative to younger adult fish, particularly when acclimated to air. Our results indicate that ageing diminishes skeletal muscle integrity and locomotor performance of amphibious fishes, and may, therefore, impair terrestrial foraging ability, predator avoidance, or dispersal across the terrestrial environment. Remarkably, older fish voluntarily left water to a similar degree as younger fish despite the age-related deterioration of traits important for terrestrial life.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, we examined whether two measures of upper thermal tolerance varied among life-history stages in a viviparous New Zealand skink (Oligosoma maccanni). First, we measured voluntary thermal maxima (VTmax) and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for four groups: late-pregnant females, newly postpartum females, males, and neonates. Second, we examined whether exposing skinks to their CTmax in late pregnancy affected success of pregnancies or size and performance of offspring. We found that both VTmax and CTmax differed among the four groups, although only CTmax differed enough to detect specific pairwise differences. Pregnant skinks and neonates had a significantly lower CTmax than postpartum skinks, and pregnant skinks also had a lower CTmax than males. Effect sizes were very large between groups, where CTmax differed significantly, and borderline large for VTmax between male and neonate skinks and between postpartum and pregnant females. Pregnancy success, and the size and sprint speed of resulting neonates were not affected by thermal-tolerance tests on late-pregnant females. The reduction in CTmax we observed in pregnant skinks could indicate that at high temperatures, pregnant skinks do not have the same ability to keep up with oxygen demands as non-pregnant skinks—possibly reflecting reduced ventilation capacity simultaneous with high oxygen demands from embryos as well as maternal tissues.

NKCC was localized by immunohistochemistry to the mucosal (apical) surface of enterocytes, and NKCC mRNA was upregulated after feeding in the anterior and posterior segments. NH4+ was equally potent to K+ in supporting NKA activity in all intestinal sections. In vitro gut sac preparations were employed to examine mucosal ammonia flux rates (Jmamm, disappearance from the mucosal saline), serosal ammonia flux rates (Jsamm, appearance in the serosal saline), and total tissue ammonia production rates (Jtamm = Jsamm − Jmamm). Bumetanide (10−4 mol L−1), a blocker of NKCC, inhibited Jsamm in most preparations, but this was largely due to reduction of Jtamm; Jmamm was significantly inhibited only in the anterior intestine of fed animals. Ouabain (10−4 mol L−1), a blocker of NKA, generally reduced both Jmamm and Jsamm without effects on Jtamm in most preparations, though the anterior intestine was resistant after feeding. Barium (10−2 mol L−1), a blocker of K+ channels, inhibited Jmamm in most preparations, and Jsamm in some, without effects on Jtamm. These pharmacological results, together with responses to manipulations of serosal and mucosal Na+ and K+ concentrations, suggest that NKCC is not as important in ammonia absorption as previously believed. NH4+ appears to be taken up through barium-sensitive K+ channels on the mucosal surface. Mucosal NH4+ uptake via both NKCC and K+ channels is energized by basolateral NKA, which plays an additional role in scavenging NH4+ on the serosal surface to possibly minimize blood toxicity or enhance ion uptake and amino acid synthesis following feeding.

We showed the participation of these two proteins with different functional patterns in gills and intestinal cells as water uptake pathways for moult and early post-moult.

These fluctuations can be dramatic, subjecting individuals to salinities characteristic of fresh water (FW < 0.5‰) and seawater (SW 35‰) within a single tidal cycle. In the current study, we reared tilapia under a tidal regimen that simulated the dynamic conditions of their native habitat. Tilapia were sampled every 3 h over a 24 h period to temporally resolve how prolactin (PRL) signaling is modulated in parallel with genes encoding branchial effectors of osmoregulation. The following parameters were measured: plasma osmolality, plasma PRL177 and PRL188 concentrations, pituitary prl177 and prl188 gene expression, and branchial prl receptor (prlr1 and prlr2), Na+/Cl−-cotransporter (ncc2), Na+/K+/2Cl−-cotransporter (nkcc1a), Na+/K+-ATPase (nkaα1a and nkaα1b), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (cftr), and aquaporin 3 (aqp3) gene expression. Throughout the 24 h sampling period, plasma osmolality reflected whether tilapia were sampled during the FW or SW phases of the tidal cycle, whereas pituitary prl gene expression and plasma PRL levels remained stable. Branchial patterns of ncc2, nkcc1a, nkaα1a, nkaα1b, cftr, and aqp3 gene expression indicated that fish exposed to tidally changing salinities regulate the expression of these gene transcripts in a similar fashion as fish held under static SW conditions.

Here we present new data from our labs together with replication by an independent lab to test how temporal, spatial, and environmental factors influence the unique spatiotemporal trajectory that worms make during magnetotaxis. We found that worms gradually change their average preferred angle of orientation by ~ 180° to the magnetic field during the course of a 90-min assay. Moreover, we found that the wild-type N2 strain prefers to orient towards the left side of a north-facing up, disc-shaped magnet. Lastly, similar to some other behaviors in C. elegans, we found that magnetic orientation may be more robust in dry conditions (< 50% RH). Our findings help explain why C. elegans accumulates with distinct patterns during different periods and in differently shaped magnetic fields.

We determined gene expressions of ASIC1, ASIC2 and ASIC3 in the CN of BALB/mice. ASIC currents in stellate cells were characterized by using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. In the voltage-clamp experiments, inward currents were recorded upon application of 2-[N-Morpholino ethanesulfonic acid]-normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (MES–aCSF), whose pH 50 was 5.84. Amiloride inhibited the acid-induced currents in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of the ASIC currents by extracellular Ca2+ and Pb2+ (10 μM) was significant evidence for the existence of homomeric ASIC1a subunits. ASIC currents were increased by 20% upon extracellular application of Zn2+ (300 μM) (p < 0.05, n = 13). In current-clamp experiments, application of MES–aCSF resulted in the depolarization of stellate cells. The results show that the ASIC currents in stellate cells of the cochlear nucleus are carried largely by the ASIC1a and ASIC2a channels.

Their vibrational signal exhibits a dominant frequency between 80 and 120 Hz, with higher frequency, lower intensity harmonics occurring approximately every 100 Hz. However, previous research revealed that not all harmonics are recorded in every signal. Therefore, how the female H. vitripennis vibrational signal changes as it travels through the plant was investigated. Results confirmed that transmission was a bending wave, with decreased signal intensity for increasing distance from the source; moreover, at distances of 50 cm, higher frequencies traveled faster than lower frequencies, suggesting that dispersion of H. vitripennis signal components may enable signaling partners to encode distance. Finally, H. vitripennis generates no detectable airborne signal (pressure wave), yet their low vibrational frequency components are detectable in neighboring plants as a result of leaf-to-air-to-leaf propagation. For instance, with isolated key female signal frequencies, 100 Hz was detected at a 10 cm gap between leaves, whereas 600 Hz was detectable only with a 0.1 cm gap. Together, these results highlight the complexity of vibration propagation in plants and suggest the possibility of the animals using the harmonic content to determine distance to the signaling H. vitripennis source.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Solitary foraging ants, in particular, rely on polarised light to orient along with a number of other visual cues. Yet it is unknown, if this cue is actively used in socially foraging species that use pheromone trails to navigate. Here, we explore the use of polarised light in the presence of the pheromone cues of the foraging trail. The desert harvester ant, Veromessor pergandei, relies on pheromone cues and path integration in separate stages of their foraging ecology (column and fan, respectively). Here, we show that foragers actively orient to an altered overhead polarisation pattern, both while navigating individually in the fan and while on the pheromone-based column. These heading changes occurred during twilight, as well as in the early morning and late afternoon before sunset. Differences in shift size indicate that foragers attend to both the polarisation pattern and the sun’s position when available, yet during twilight, headings are dominated by the polarisation pattern. Finally, when the sun’s position was experimentally blocked before sunset, shift sizes increased similar to twilight testing.

In species that mate during several reproductive bouts throughout their life, mating causes an increase in oviposition, affects immune function, and decreases female lifespan and receptivity to further mating. Social Hymenoptera (ants, social bees, and wasps) are unique, since queens mate during a single reproductive effort at the beginning of their life. Their reproductive strategy is thus fundamentally different from that of other insects and one might expect the effects of mating on social Hymenoptera queens to be altered. We tested the effect of mating and multiple mating on the expression of six genes likely to be involved in post-mating changes, in queens of the ant Lasius niger L. We show that mating induces oviposition, and is followed by an up-regulation of vitellogenin and defensin expression. The expression of juvenile hormone esterase, insulin receptor 2, Cu−Zn superoxide dismutase 1, and prophenoloxidase is not significantly affected by mating.

This study investigated the functional response of ex situ immune cells from stranded phocids to in vitro increased pressure, over the course of rehabilitation. Blood samples were drawn from stranded harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) and harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) at the time of admit to the Mystic Aquarium, Mystic, CT and again after rehabilitation (pre-release). Phagocytosis, lymphocyte proliferation and immune cell activation were measured in vitro, with and without exposure to 2000 psi (simulated dive depth of 1360 m).

Under admit or release conditions, pressure exposures resulted in significant changes in granulocyte and monocyte phagocytosis, granulocyte expression of CD11b and lymphocyte expression of the IL2 receptor (IL2R). Overall, pressure exposures resulted in decreased phagocytosis for admit conditions, but increased phagocytosis in release samples. Expression of leukocyte activation markers, CD11b and IL2R, increased and the response did not differ between admit and release samples. Specific hematological and serum chemistry values also changed significantly between admit and release and were significantly correlated with pressure-induced changes in immune function.

The first objective was to test whether 5-HT may be acting as a hormone in the control of pulsatile urea excretion by measuring potential fluctuations in circulating 5-HT corresponding with a urea pulse, which would suggest circulating 5-HT may be involved with urea pulse activation. We found that plasma 5-HT significantly decreased by 38% 1 h after pulse detection when branchial urea excretion was significantly elevated and then returned to baseline. This suggests that 5-HT is removed from the circulation, possibly through clearance or excretion, and may be involved in the termination of pulsatile urea excretion. There appeared to be no pulsatile release of 5-HT from peripheral tissues to trigger a urea pulse. The second objective was to determine if additional 5-HT receptor subtypes, such as an additional 5-HT2 receptor (5-HT2C receptor) or the 5-HT receptors that are linked to cAMP (5-HT4/6/7 receptors), played a role in the stimulation of urea excretion. Intravenous injection of 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor agonists did not result in a urea pulse, suggesting that these receptors, and thus cAMP, are not involved in stimulating urea excretion. The involvement of circulating 5-HT and the 5-HT2A receptor in the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion may provide insight into its adaptive significance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The present paper extends these previous findings and describes the combined effects of pH and cationic heavy metals on branchiostegite uptake of 45Ca2+. Partially purified membrane vesicles of branchiostegite cells were produced by a homogenization/centrifugation method and were loaded with mannitol at pH 7.0. The time course of 1 mM 45Ca2+ uptake in a mannitol medium at pH 8.5 containing 100 µM verapamil (Ca2+ channel blocker) was hyperbolic and approached equilibrium at 30 min. This uptake was either significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by the addition of 5 µM Zn2+ or essentially abolished with the addition of 5 µM Cu2+. Increasing zinc concentrations (5–500 µM) reduced 1 mM 45Ca2+ uptake at pH 8.5 or 7.5 in a hyperbolic fashion with the remaining non-inhibited uptake due to apparent non-specific binding. Uptake of 1 mM 45Ca2+ at pH 8.5, 7.5, 7.5 + Zn2+, and 7.5 + Zn2+ + Cu2+ + Cd2+ in the presence of 100 µM verapamil displayed a stepwise reduction of 45Ca2+ uptake with the addition of each treatment until only non-specific isotope binding occurred with all cation inhibitors. 45Ca2+ influxes (15 s uptakes; 0.25–5.0 mM calcium + 100 µM verapamil) in the presence and absence of 10 µM Zn2+ were both hyperbolic functions of calcium concentration. The curve with Zn2+ displayed a transport Km twice that of the control (p < 0.05), while inhibitor and control curve Jmax values were not significantly different (p > 0.05), suggesting competitive inhibition between 45Ca2+ and Zn2+ influxes. Analysis of the relative inhibitory effects of increased proton or heavy metal interaction with 45Ca2+ uptake suggests that divalent metals may reduce the calcium transport about twice as much as a drop in pH, but together, they appear to abolish carrier-mediated transport.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

From the 1990s onwards, researchers from other countries were invited to join the Zürich group, so that Cataglyphis increasingly advanced to become a model organism for the study of animal navigation. Its cockpit became the focus of a dynamic research system, an ‘epistemic thing’, as modern parlance in the philosophy of science has it. Investigations aimed at the ants’ compasses and odometers, at path integration, view-based landmark guidance, and how information from these various navigational routines is combined in computing the courses to steer. In this multifaceted work, the researchers’ familiarity with the site, with Mahrès, and its local geographical and historical conditions, has been essential. The essay briefly retraces the historical development of this research system.

During RFR acquisition, adapting signals lasting 128 ms each were alternated with test signals lasting 16 ms each; the test signal levels varied randomly. Adapting signals were trains of cosine-enveloped tone pips or pure tones. Pip rate varied with the envelope cosine cycle maintained at 0.125 of pip intervals and the cosine rise–fall time maintained at 0.0625 of pip intervals. Adapting signals shifted the amplitude-level function upward compared to the baseline (no adapting signal) function. The higher the adapting signal level was, the bigger the shift in the amplitude-level function was. The slower the pips were in the adapting signal, the smaller the adaptation effect was. A train of pips with a 0.0625-ms rise–fall time and 125 dB SPL shifted the function by 35–40 dB, whereas a train of pips with a 1-ms rise–fall time or a pure tone with the same SPL shifted the function by approximately 15 dB.

In this study, a population of Liolaemus koslowskyi was studied to analyze the diversity and functioning of the lipid reserve structures. The specific objectives were to identify the main lipid reserve structures, and to describe their seasonal patterns; to study sexual and seasonal variations of the reserve structures; and to analyze the relation between seasonal patterns of such reserves with the sexual cycle and other biological aspects. Individuals of both sexes collected at five different times of the year were analyzed. The abdominal fat bodies, livers, tails, fat deposits of the lateral folds of the neck, the fat bodies of the axillary region and gonads were weighted. The fat content of livers, tails and neck fat reserves were determined through the extraction in a Soxhlet device. The volume of the ovaries, oviductal oocytes and testicles, and the average surface and thickness of the epididymides were estimated. The abdominal fat bodies and the tail-extracted fats were the main lipid reserves. In general, females showed higher lipid contents, and significant seasonal variations in weight and lipid content in both sex were found, while seasonal variations in the liver fresh weight and liver fat content were found only in males. The axillar and neck fats deposits probably function as auxiliary reserves, and the caudal autotomy did not significantly affect tail fat content.

Previous work has demonstrated that hypoxia acclimation of deer mice and low altitude white-footed mice (P. leucopus) increases the force generating capacity of the diaphragm. The mechanism behind this improved contractile function is not known. Within myocytes, the myofilament plays a critical role in setting the rate and level of force production, and its ability to generate force can change in response to changes in physiological conditions. In the current study, we examined how chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure of deer mice and white-footed mice influences the Ca2+ activation of force generation by skinned diaphragmatic myofilaments, and the phosphorylation of myofilament proteins. Results demonstrate that myofilament force production, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation, were not impacted by acclimation to hypobaric hypoxia, and did not differ between preparations from the two species. The cooperativity of the force-pCa relationship, and the maximal rate of force generation were also the same in the preparations from both species, and not impacted by acclimation. Finally, the relative phosphorylation of TnT, and MLC was lower in deer mice than white-footed mice, but was not affected by acclimation. These results indicate that species differences in diaphragm function, and the increase in force production with hypoxia acclimation, are not due to differences, or changes, in myofilament function. However, it appears that diaphragmatic myofilament function in these species is not affected by chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The role of the ocelli in walking insects such as ants has been less explored. Physiological and behavioural evidence in the desert ant, Cataglyphis bicolor, indicates that ocellar receptors are polarisation sensitive and are used to derive compass information from the pattern of polarised skylight. The ability to detect polarised skylight can also be inferred from the structure and the organisation of the ocellar retina. However, the functional anatomy of the desert ant ocelli has not been investigated. Here we characterised the anatomical organisation of the ocelli in three species of desert ants. The two congeneric species of Cataglyphis we studied had a fused rhabdom, but differed in their organisation of the retina. In Cataglyphis bicolor, each retinula cell contributed microvilli in one orientation enabling them to compare e-vector intensities. In Cataglyphis fortis, some retinula cells contributed microvilli in more than one orientation, indicating that not all cells are polarisation sensitive. The desert ant Melophorus bagoti had an unusual ocellar retina with a hexagonal or pentagonal rhabdomere arrangement forming an open rhabdom. Each retinula cell contributed microvilli in more than one orientation, making them unlikely to be polarisation detectors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

There is considerable variation in the magnitude of the baroreflex amongst vertebrate groups, making phylogenetic trends and association with major evolutionary events such as air-breathing and endothermy, difficult to identify. In the present study, we quantified the baroreflex in the facultative air-breathing catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. Using a pharmacological approach, we quantified the cardiac limb of the baroreflex and by subjecting fish to hypoxia and by stimulation with NaCN with and without pharmacological autonomic blockade; we also examined the cardiovascular regulation associated with air-breathing. As in most other air-breathing fish, air-breathing elicited a substantial tachycardia. This tachycardia was abolished by cholinergic muscarinic pharmacological blockade, which also abolished the cardiac limb of the baroreflex, and consequently such fish failed to maintain their arterial blood pressure when air-breathing. In higher vertebrate classes, baroreceptors elicit ventilatory changes; however, whether this is the case in fish has not previously been investigated. Pangasianodon hypophthalmus demonstrated a prominent increase in ventilation during imposed hypotension. Collectively, these results demonstrate, for the first time, an efficient baroreflex in an air-breathing fish, point towards involvement of baroreceptors in blood pressure regulation during air-breathing, and show a correlation between blood pressure and ventilation, providing additional information on the origin of this link.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Instead of organizing the review along the types of stimulus energy (force) taken up by the sensors, processes associated with a few basic and seemingly simple mechanical principles like lever systems, viscoelasticity, resonance, traveling waves, and impedance matching are taken as the guideline.

For tail-flips that are generated by the medial giants (MG) in response to frontal attacks, the scales started to extend immediately after stimulation and extension was completed before the animal began to propel backwards. For tail-flips that are elicited by caudal stimuli and controlled by the lateral giants (LG), scale extensions began with significant delay after the tail-flip movement was initiated, and full extension of the scales coincided with full flexion of the tail. When we used implanted electrodes and stimulated the giant neurons directly, we observed the same patterns of scale extensions and corresponding timing. In addition, single action potentials of MG and LG neurons evoked with intracellular current injections in minimally restrained preparations were sufficient to activate scale extensions with similar delays as seen in freely behaving animals. Our results suggest that the giant interneurons, which have been assumed to be part of hardwired reflex circuits that lead to caudal motor outputs and stereotyped behavior, are also responsible for activating a pair of antennal scales with high temporal precision.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Whether echolocating bats can also use magnetic cues during foraging remains unknown, however. Here, we tested the orientation behavior of Chinese noctules (Nyctalus plancyi) during foraging in a plus-shaped, 4-channel apparatus under different magnetic field conditions. To minimize the effects of spatial memory on orientation from repeated experiments, naïve bats were tested only once in each experimental condition. As expected, under geomagnetic field and a food resource offered conditions, the bats significantly preferred to enter the channel containing food, indicating that they primarily relied on direct sensory signals unrelated to magnetic cues. In contrast, when we offered food simultaneously in all four channels and minimized any differences in all other sensory signals available, the bats exhibited a clear directional preference to forage along the magnetic field direction under either geomagnetic field or a magnetic field in which the horizontal component was rotated by 90°. Our study offers a novel evidence for the importance of a geomagnetic field during foraging.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Across a variety of taxa receptivity to signals increases, as does peripheral auditory sensitivity, as females transition from a non-breeding to breeding condition. We recently documented decreases in receptivity to acoustic mate attraction signals and circulating hormone levels, but an increase in peripheral auditory sensitivity to call-like stimuli following oviposition in Cope’s gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis). However, it is not known if changes in auditory sensitivity are confined to the frequency range of calls, or if they result from more generalized changes in the auditory periphery. Here, we used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to evaluate peripheral frequency sensitivity in female Cope’s gray treefrogs before and after oviposition. We found lower ABR thresholds, greater ABR amplitudes, and shorter ABR latencies following oviposition. Changes were most pronounced and consistent at lower frequencies associated with the amphibian papilla, but were also detectable at higher frequencies corresponding to the tuning of the basilar papilla. Furthermore, only ABR latencies were correlated with circulating steroid hormones (testosterone).

However, how gustatory responsiveness and hemolymph sugar levels coordinate with one another to maintain energetic homeostasis in insects remains largely unknown for the highly social honeybee that goes through large physiological and behavioral changes. The potential role of biogenic amines and neuropeptides in the connection between the regulation of appetite and fluctuating sugar levels in the hemolymph, due to starvation, as the bee ages, was investigated. The largest appetite increase due to the starvation treatment was within the forager age class and this corresponded with an increase in octopamine levels in the brain along with a decline in hemolymph sugar levels. Adipokinetic hormone (AKH) was found in very small quantities in the brain and there were no significant changes in response to starvation treatment. Our findings suggest that the particularly dynamic levels of hemolymph sugar levels may serve as a monitor of the forager honeybee energetic state. Therefore, there may be a pathway in forager bees via octopamine responsible for their precise precipitous regulation of appetite, but to determine cause and effect relationships further investigation is needed.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We examined the pre-ingestive responses of honeybees to sucrose solutions containing a mix of pollen compounds, the amino acids proline or phenylalanine, or known distasteful substances, quinine and salt. We predicted that in taste and learning assays, bees would respond positively to the presence of nutrient compounds in a sucrose solution. However, bees’ proboscis extension responses decreased when their antennae were stimulated with pollen- or amino acid-supplemented sucrose solutions. Compared to pure sucrose, bees exhibited worse acquisition when conditioned to an odour with pollen-supplemented sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus. Such learning impairment was also observed with quinine-containing sucrose solutions. Our results suggest that bees can use their antennae to detect pollen compounds in floral nectars. Depending on the type and concentrations of compounds present, this may result in nectar being perceived as distasteful by bees, making it less effective in reinforcing the learning of floral cues. Such reward devaluation might be adaptive in cases where plants benefit from regulating the frequency of bee visitation.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Among the cells generated through the activity of adult neural stem cells are electromotoneurons, whose axons constitute the electric organ of this weakly electric fish. Electromotoneuron development is organized along a caudo-rostral gradient, with the youngest and smallest of these cells located near the caudal end of the spinal cord. Electromotoneurons start expressing calbindin-D28k when their somata have reached diameters of approximately 10 μm, and they continue expression after they have grown to a final size of about 50 μm. Calbindin-D28k expression is significantly increased in young neurons generated in response to injury. Immunohistochemical staining against caspase-3 revealed that electromotoneurons in both intact and regenerating spinal cord are significantly less likely to undergo apoptosis than the average spinal cord cell. We hypothesize that expression of calbindin-D28k protects electromotoneurons from cell death; and that the evolutionary development of such a neuroprotective mechanism has been driven by the indispensability of electromotoneurons in the fish’s electric behavior, and by the high size-dependent costs associated with their production or removal upon cell death.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To investigate this possibility, absolute thresholds for brief tones were determined for four species of bats: The Common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) and the Greater spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus hastatus), both of which use frequency-modulated calls, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), an echolocator that uses tongue-clicks rather than laryngeal calls, and the Dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), a non-echolocating species. Norway rats and a human were tested for comparison using the same acoustic stimuli. Contrary to expectations, the echolocating bats were not superior to non-echolocating mammals in detecting brief tones in the frequency range of their echolocation calls. Instead, all four species of bats were remarkably less sensitive than non-bats to brief sounds of 10 kHz and below. This implies that temporal summation in the mammalian auditory system can show large species differences, and that the detection of brief sound is likely influenced by the selective pressures on each species as well as by the physical integration of energy in the auditory system. Such species differences in function are expected to be reflected in the physiology of their auditory systems.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The Australian sugarbag bee (Tetragonula carbonaria Sm.) has innate preferences for colours, including UV-absorbing white. Sugarbag bees are pollinators of the terrestrial orchid Caladenia carnea R.Br., which has both white and pink morphs. In laboratory conditions, we tested flower-naïve bees with the white and pink flower morphs revealing a significant preference for the white morph, consistent with experiments using artificial stimuli. In experiments to understand how bees may select food-deceptive orchids following habituation to a particular colour morph, we observed a significant increase in choices towards novel white flowers. We also observed that the presence of a UV-reflecting dorsal sepal signal significantly increased bee choices compared to flowers that had the UV signal blocked. Our findings demonstrate that innate preference testing of insect pollinators with artificial stimuli is replicated in a biologically significant scenario with flowers. The findings also underscore how food-deceptive orchids can receive sufficient pollinator visits to ensure pollination by having different morphs that draw on the innate preferences of bees and their ability to make decisions in a complex ecological setting.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Thus, features of single origin can be distinguished from those with multiple origins. Nearly all pollination modes originate in multiple evolutionary ways. (ii) The most frequent pollinators cause the strongest selection because they are responsible for the plant’s most successful reproduction. The European sexually deceptive orchid genus Ophrys provides an example of a more direct way to prove selection because the attraction of a pollinator is species specific. Most members of the genus have remarkably variable flowers. The variability of the signals given off by the flowers enables the deceived pollinator males to learn individual flower patterns. They thus avoid already visited Ophrys flowers, interpreting them as females rejecting them. As the males will not return to these individually recognizable flowers, the pollinators´ learning behavior causes cross-pollination and prevents the orchid’s self-pollination.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Honeybees possess a miniature brain but exhibit remarkable cognitive abilities, including the capacity to perform numerosity judgments in a foraging context. Honeybee foragers can count up to four landmarks en route to the goal and use this information to decide where to land. They also learn to match visual images based on item number and may use absolute or relative numerosity. They can be trained to choose item arrays based on rules such as ‘smaller than’, in which case their performance reveals the existence of zero as a conceptual low end of a succession of positive numbers.

There is evidence, however, that polyunsaturated fatty acids can counteract the pathogenic effects of saturated fatty acids. To gain insight into the early molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids influence hypothalamic inflammation and insulin signalling, we performed time-course experiments in a hypothalamic cell line, using different durations of treatment with the saturated fatty acid palmitate, and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Western blot analysis revealed that palmitate elevated the protein levels of phospho(p)AKT in a time-dependent manner. This effect is involved in the pathogenicity of palmitate, as temporary inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway by selective PI3K inhibitors prevented the palmitate-induced attenuation of insulin signalling. Similar to palmitate, DHA also increased levels of pAKT, but to a weaker extent. Co-administration of DHA with palmitate decreased pAKT close to the basal level after 8 h, and prevented the palmitate-induced reduction of insulin signalling after 12 h. The monounsaturated fatty acid oleate had a similar effect on the palmitate-induced attenuation of insulin signalling, the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleate had no effect. Measurement of the inflammatory markers pJNK and pNFκB-p65 revealed tonic elevation of both markers in the presence of palmitate alone. DHA alone transiently induced elevation of pJNK, returning to basal levels by 12 h treatment. Co-administration of DHA with palmitate prevented palmitate-induced inflammation after 12 h, but not at earlier timepoints.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Under ultraviolet light, the wings of both male and female P. r. rapae appear dark, whereas the wings of male P. r. crucivora are dark and those of females are bright. It has been hypothesized that these sexually dimorphic wing reflections in P. r. crucivora may have induced the evolution of a fluorescing-screening pigment in the violet-opsin-expressing photoreceptors of males, thus facilitating greater wavelength discrimination near 400 nm. Comparing the compound eyes of the two subspecies using genetic, microscopical, spectrographic, and histological methods revealed no differences that would meaningfully affect photoreceptor sensitivity, suggesting that the fluorescing-screening pigment did not evolve in response to sexually dimorphic wing reflections. Our investigation further revealed that (i) the peri-rhabdomal reddish-screening pigments differ among the three ommatidial types; (ii) each of the ommatidial types exhibits a unique class of red photoreceptor with a distinct spectral peak; and (iii) the blue, green, and red photoreceptors of P. rapae exhibit a polarization sensitivity > 2, with red photoreceptors allowing for a two-channel opponency form of polarization sensitivity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The fish needs to quickly select one object from among many others. In animals other than the archerfish, long-range inhibition is considered to drive selection. As a result of long-range inhibition, a potential target outside a neuron’s receptive field suppresses the activity elicited by another potential target within the receptive field. We tested whether a similar mechanism operates in the archerfish by recording the activity of neurons in the optic tectum while presenting a target stimulus inside the receptive field and a competing stimulus outside the receptive field. We held the features of the target constant while varying the size, speed, and distance of the competing stimulus. We found cells that exhibit long-range inhibition; i.e., inhibition that extends to a significant part of the entire visual field of the animal. The competing stimulus depressed the firing rate. In some neurons, this effect was dependent on the features of the competing stimulus. These findings suggest that long-range inhibition may play a crucial role in the target selection process in the archerfish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

It is a show case of organismic diversity and the working of evolution. Apart from attracting our intrinsic intellectual interest and fascination, it is of prime ecological significance and has an enormous economic impact as well. Research into this partnership, which is an opportunistic business trading food against pollination, is not new at all, but started more than 200 years ago (Sprengel 1793). Accordingly, a large number of cases of fine-tuned adaptedness to this business at all levels of organismic organization have come to light already. This applies to both the flower and the pollinator side, which both are subject to selection pressures working in favor of survival and reproductive success. Considering the staggering diversity of angiosperms and even more so that of insects, the spectrum of specializations is enormous, sometimes just beautiful for us like the colors of an alpine meadow at summertime, sometimes bizarre and hard to believe, like the stories about fraud and robbery. To reach a well-founded understanding of adaptedness and the selective pressures that have shaped it research approaches need to be both reductionist and holistic. What we see today largely is the product of some 100 million years of co-evolution. In this sense, the summer meadow to a considerable extent is to be valued as a reflection of the pollinating insects and vice versa. This is seen in countless intimate dependencies resulting from reciprocal selection. In this special issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A some recent research will be highlighted dealing with such different subjects as evolutionary fundamentals, functional morphology, floral signals, and insect senses and cognition. To start, Hannes Paulus in his review ‘General questions and sexually deceptive orchids’ raises some basic questions regarding evolutionary mechanisms, which are crucial for an understanding of the partnership between insects and flowers and the meaning of biodiversity. How can the reciprocal selection generating a particular pollination syndrome be reliably proven? The European orchids of the sexual deceptive genus Ophrys are taken as an example. Their flowers do not offer any food and have developed fascinating ways of manipulating their pollinators. They demonstrate the complexity and refinement in the relationship between flower signals attracting male bees and wasps and the visitors’ responses, even making use of the pollinator’s ability to memorize and learn an individual flower’s characteristics. The flower fools its highly species-specific insect visitor when attracting him by visual, chemical and tactile signals, which he expects to stem from a receptive conspecific female. However, the male insect remembers and avoids a flower already visited, associating it with an unreceptive female. These findings point to the relevance of the striking variability of both the visual and olfactory signals emanating from the flowers. In the end, the flowers’ variability supports cross-pollination and helps to avoid self pollination. The pollinator’s innate preference is overruled by learning. Clearly, this story also underlines the value and necessity of combining simple observations and manipulative experiments in the field with work in the laboratory, learning from analyses made possible by modern technology. Such technology has proven crucial with regard to the detailed analyses of many floral scents and the chemosensory capabilities of the corresponding insect visitors. ‘Floral scent, nectar and chemoreception’ is the headline for the following four contributions. Annemarie Heiduk et al. present another very specialized pollination system where floral scents are a crucial element in the communication between the partners. Ceropegia stenantha * Friedrich G.

Color discrimination thresholds were determined along 20 chromatic axes around the background chromaticity. A color discrimination ellipse was drawn by interpolation among these thresholds. The albino monkey’s behavioral color discrimination ellipse showed poor discrimination along the red–green axis indicating a deutan phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed only the presence of the L gene in the albino monkey. This result did not differ from that obtained with ten previously tested non-albino monkeys.

Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles that synthesize melanins, the most widespread pigments in animals. The synthesis of the orange melanin, termed pheomelanin, depends on cysteine levels because the sulfhydryl group is used to form the pigment. Pheomelanin synthesis may, therefore, be affected by cysteine homeostasis, although this has never been explored in a natural system. As diet is an important source of cysteine, here we indirectly tested for such an effect by searching for an association between food abundance and pheomelanin content of feathers in a wild population of Northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis. As predicted on the basis that CTNS expression may inhibit pheomelanin synthesis and increase with food abundance as previously found in other strictly carnivorous birds, we found that the feather pheomelanin content in nestling goshawks, but not in adults, decreased as the abundance of prey available to them increased. In contrast, variation in the feather content of the non-sulphurated melanin form (eumelanin) was only explained by sex in both nestlings and adults. We also found that the feather pheomelanin content of nestlings was negatively related to that of their mothers, suggesting a relevant environmental influence on pheomelanin synthesis. Overall, our findings suggest that variation in pheomelanin synthesis may be a side effect of the maintenance of cysteine homeostasis. This may help explaining variability in the expression of pigmented phenotypes.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Metabolism is influenced by nutritional status governed by feeding, nutrient intake and quality, and time without food. However, little is understood about contribution of protein synthesis to crustacean energy metabolism. This study is the first using a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to research contribution of cycloheximide-sensitive protein synthesis to decapod crustacean metabolism. Juvenile Sagmariasus verreauxi were subject to five treatments: 2-day fasted lobsters sham injected with saline; 2-day fasted lobsters injected with cycloheximide; 10-day starved lobsters injected with cycloheximide; post-prandial lobsters fed with squid Nototodarus sloanii with no further treatment; and post-prandial lobsters injected with cycloheximide. Standard and routine metabolic rates in starved lobsters were reduced by 32% and 41%, respectively, compared to fasted lobsters, demonstrating metabolic downregulation with starvation. Oxygen consumption rates of fasted and starved lobsters following cycloheximide injection were reduced by 29% and 13%, respectively, demonstrating protein synthesis represents only a minor component of energy metabolism in unfed lobsters. Oxygen consumption rate of fed lobsters was reduced by 96% following cycloheximide injection, demonstrating protein synthesis in decapods contributes a major proportion of specific dynamic action (SDA). SDA in decapods is predominantly a post-absorptive process likely related to somatic growth.

When it comes to mantis shrimp, however, the situation becomes complicated due to the complexity of their visual system and their range of eye movements. The stalked eyes of mantis shrimp can independently move left and right, and up and down, whilst simultaneously rotating about the axis of the eye stalks. Despite the large range of rotational freedom, mantis shrimp nevertheless show a stereotypical gaze stabilization response to horizontal motion of a wide-field, high-contrast stimulus. This response is often accompanied by pitch (up-down) and torsion (about the eye stalk) rotations which, surprisingly, have no effect on the performance of yaw (side-to-side) gaze stabilization. This unusual feature of mantis shrimp vision suggests that their neural circuitry for detecting motion is radially symmetric and immune to the confounding effects of torsional self-motion. In this work, we reinforce this finding, demonstrating that the yaw gaze stabilization response of the mantis shrimp is robust to the ambiguous motion cues arising from the motion of striped visual gratings in which the angle of a grating is offset from its direction of travel.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Clearly, such variability can profoundly impact individual fitness, as well as subtly alter sexual selection processes, but we know little about the neural mechanisms underlying such variability. We examined the influence of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) on the strength of attraction of female gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) showing positive phonotaxis to the call of a conspecific male. Female treefrogs received intracerebroventricular injections with either saline, AVT (five doses), or the AVT receptor antagonist Manning compound (two doses). By 30 min after injection, AVT significantly increased the speed with which females approached the speaker, at doses of 1, 10 and 50 ng per frog. At the highest dose, the average speed was doubled. The AVT antagonist significantly inhibited phonotaxis at both doses (50 and 100 ng). The effects of AVT on treefrog phonotaxis were shorter lived (disappearing within 60–90 min), compared to Manning compound (effects persisted at least 90 min). These findings support the hypothesis that endogenous AVT is critical to the display of female phonotaxis behavior. AVT may thus contribute to variability in female mate choices by modulating proceptive behaviors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This flexibility may occur over periods of days to weeks, but the underlying mechanisms for such flexibility are not well understood. Because lipids are the primary fuel for sustained thermogenesis, we examined whether lipid transport and catabolism can mediate within-winter metabolic flexibility in two small temperate-zone wintering passerine birds, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We used simple and multiple regression analyses to test for correlations of several lipid transporters in pectoralis muscle (plasma membrane-bound and cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins, FABP; fatty acyl translocase, FAT/CD36) and regulatory enzymes (carnitine acyl transferase, CPT; β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HOAD) in pectoralis and heart with short-term (ST, 0–7 days), medium-term (MT, 14–30 days) and long-term (LT, 30-year mean daily and extreme minimum temperatures, day of winter season) temperature variables. We hypothesized negative correlations between these regulators and temperature variables. Juncos showed negative correlations for FABPs with ST or MT temperature variables, but other lipid transporters and regulatory enzymes showed positive correlations with ST or MT temperatures for juncos, suggesting no consistent pathway-wide response to within-winter temperatures. LT temperature variables showed several significant associations with lipid transporters and enzymes for juncos, but also not in consistent directions. House sparrows showed the expected negative correlations with LT temperatures for FABPpm, but positive correlations with temperature variables for FABPc, CPT and HOAD. Different species-specific patterns of variation and the absence of consistent pathway-wide responses to temperature suggest that the lipid transport and catabolism pathway is not a uniform mediator of within-winter metabolic flexibility among small birds.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Statistically significant influence of species on dopamine levels were recorded, with P. siculus having twice as much dopamine in their brains. Taking into account that a significant aggressive relationship, with P. siculus dominating over P. melisellensis, has been previously observed, and that dopamine directly influences this behavior, the observed differences in dopamine levels could represent a trait in these species and may contribute to the competitive exclusion of P. melisellensis by P. siculus in the eastern Adriatic.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We studied CS groups that affect control of the thoraco-coxal joint in the stick insect Carausius morosus by applying horizontal and vertical forces to the leg stump. Motor effects of ablation of CS groups were evaluated by recording extracellularly from protractor (ProCx) and retractor (RetCx) nerves. Extracellular recordings showed that the effects of stimulating the sensilla were consistent with their broad ranges of directional sensitivity: for example, RetCx firing in response to posterior bending could be reduced by ablating several groups of trochanteral CS, whereas ablation of tibial and femoral sensilla had little effect. In contrast, ProCx motor neuron activity upon anteriorly directed stimuli was affected mainly by ablating a single CS group (G2). Dye fills of trochanteral, femoral and tibial CS groups with fluorescent dyes revealed a common projection pattern with little group specificity. These findings support the idea that the influences of CS feedback are determined by the activities of pre-motor interneurons, facilitating fast and task-dependent adaptation to changing environmental conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We found that, when manipulating the direction of polarised skylight, Si. fasciculatus responded to this change with a similar change in bearing. However, when the apparent position of the sun was moved, the woodland-living beetle did not change its direction of travel. In contrast, the savannah-living beetle Scarabaeus lamarcki responded to the manipulation of the solar position with a corresponding change in bearing.

Through analyzing protein changes in the midgut diverticula, hemolymph, and ovaries of females throughout the different vitellogenic stages of the spider Polybetes pythagoricus, we determined the origin of the different proteins involved in the formation of lipovitellins (LVs) along with the existence of a linkage between the hemocyanin and this vital process. An increase in the total protein content of the midgut diverticula, hemolymph, and ovary occurred throughout vitellogenesis followed by a decrease in those levels after laying. The presence of hemocyanin in egg and in LV2, as well as its accumulation in the ovary throughout the vitellogenesis process, was determined. Considering that all biologic processes depend on the correct structure and function of proteins, this study establishes, for the first time for the Order Araneae, the coexistence of three different origins of vitellogenesis-related proteins: one predominantly ovarian involving peptides of 120, 75, 46, and 30 kDa; another extraovarian one originated from the midgut diverticula and represented by a 170 kDa peptide, and a third hemolymphatic one, represented by the 67 kDa peptide.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The permanence of populations of this species in the Caspian Sea is fully dependent on restocking programs. Accordingly, it is considered as an interesting target for aquaculture for both restocking and commercial purposes. In addition, as a Chondrostei, it exhibits one of the slowest rates of molecular evolution among vertebrates and is propounded as an excellent candidate for phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary biology. In this study, the early ontogeny of some key digestive enzymes precursors was determined at molecular level, aiming to obtain basic knowledge on the acquisition of digestive capacity of this species, and at the same time, to advance in its phylogenetic status from the point of view of digestion. For this purpose, A. persicus cDNAs for β-actin (actb; used as an internal reference gene), bile-salt activated lipase (cel), trypsinogen 1 (try1), pepsinogen (pga), and gastric proton pump (atp4a) were amplified and cloned, and their subsequent expressions were measured by quantitative real-time PCR during the first 34 days post hatch (dph). Two isoforms for pga and at least six for try1 were obtained in this study, probably due to the additional genome duplication which sturgeons suffered along evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acids sequences from the studied genes demonstrated that this species has a close evolutionary distance to Holostei, coelacanths, and tetrapods, including amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. According to our results, expression of all the genes increased gradually over time and reached maximum levels around 18 dph. This pattern, which was comparable to length and weight data, could indicate that around 3 weeks after hatching, the digestive capacity of the Persian sturgeon changes from larval to juvenile mode.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In this study, the critical O2 tension (Pcrit), a whole animal measure of the aerobic contribution to hypoxia tolerance, was compared between four New Zealand triplefin fishes including an intertidal specialist (Bellapiscis medius), an occasional intertidal inhabitant (Forsterygion lapillum) and two exclusively subtidal species (F. varium and F. malcolmi). The intertidal species had lower Pcrit values than the subtidal species indicating traits to meet resting O2 demands at lower O2 tensions. While resting O2 demand (standard metabolic rate; SMR) did not show a major difference between species, the intertidal species had higher maximal rates of O2 consumption ($$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{{2,{ \hbox{max} }}} $$M˙O2,max) and higher aerobic metabolic scope (MS). The high O2 extractive capacity of the intertidal species was associated with increased blood O2 carrying capacity (i.e., higher Hb concentration), in addition to higher mass-specific gill surface area and thinner gill secondary lamellae that collectively conveyed a higher capacity for O2 flux across the gills. The specialist intertidal species B. medius also had higher glycogen stores in both white muscle and brain tissues, suggesting a greater potential to generate ATP anaerobically and survive in rock pools with O2 tensions less than Pcrit. Overall, this study shows that the superior Pcrit of intertidal triplefin species is not linked to a minimisation of SMR, but is instead associated with an increased O2 extractive capacity of the cardiorespiratory system (i.e., $$ \dot{M}{\text{O}}_{{2,{ \hbox{max} }}} $$M˙O2,max, MS, Hb and gill O2 flux).",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Human observers perceive images with naturalistic image statistics as more pleasant to view, and both fly and vertebrate peripheral and higher order visual neurons are tuned to naturalistic image statistics. However, for a given animal, what is natural differs depending on the behavior, and even if we have a broad understanding of image statistics, we know less about the scenes relevant for particular behaviors. To mitigate this, we here investigate the image statistics surrounding Episyrphus balteatus hoverflies, where the males hover in sun shafts created by surrounding trees, producing a rich and dense background texture and also intricate shadow patterns on the ground. We quantified the image statistics of photographs of the ground and the surrounding panorama, as the ventral and lateral visual field is particularly important for visual flight control, and found differences in spatial statistics in photos where the hoverflies were hovering compared to where they were flying.

For this, we conducted acoustic playback experiments, using synthetic calls and natural calls recorded at increasing distances from a focal male as stimuli. We found that the degradation of temporal structure had a greater effect on signal attractiveness than did the reduction in sound level, and that increasing sound level preferentially affected the attractiveness of proximally recorded calls, with less temporal degradation. Unlike signal attraction, accuracy of female localization increased systematically with the sound level. These results suggest that the degradation of temporal fine structure from both the chorus and signal-environmental effects imposes a limit for effective communication distances for female treefrogs in nature.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) live in the Arctic and rely on thick insulation to maintain thermal homeostasis. Adult harp seals primarily use blubber for insulation, but newborn harp seals rely on a lanugo pelt while nursing, as their blubber layer develops and their first-year pelage grows. This study compared ontogenetic changes in the thermal properties of harp seal pelts in water and in air. Thermal conductivity, pelt thickness, and thermal resistance were measured in water for pelts of harp seal neonates (1 day old), thin whitecoats (4 day old), fat whitecoats (9 day old), ragged jackets (2 week old), beaters (3 week old), and adults and compared to previously published measurements made on the same pelts in air. Pelt conductivity was significantly higher in water than air for pre-molt and molting pups (P ≤ 0.031). Unlike adult pelage, which flattened underwater, lanugo hairs lifted underwater, a phenomenon that has not been reported previously. Thermal resistance of the pelt was significantly reduced in water compared to air for neonates and thin whitecoats (P ≤ 0.0001). A mathematical model of conductive heat transfer for an ellipsoid body showed volume-specific heat loss in water decreased and then stabilized as harp seals aged (P = 0.0321) and was significantly higher for neonates, thin whitecoats, and ragged jackets in water than in air (P ≤ 0.0089). Overall, pelt function is reduced in water for harp seal pups with lanugo, and this renders neonates and thin whitecoats particularly vulnerable to heat loss if submerged.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we investigated the organization of the connections between the brain and arms through the cerebrobrachial tracts (CBT). To do this, we analyzed the neuronal activity associated with the contraction of a small muscle strand left connected at the middle of a long isolated CBT. Both electrical activity in the CBT and muscle contraction could be induced at low threshold values irrespective of stimulus direction and distance from the muscle strand. This suggests that axons associated with transmitting motor commands run along the CBT and innervate a large pool of motor neurons en passant. This type of innervation implies that central and peripheral motor commands involve the simultaneous recruitment of large groups of motor neurons along the arm as required, for example, in arm stiffening, and that the site of movement initiation along the arm may be determined through a unique interplay between global central commands and local sensory signals.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The consequent water deficit over several consecutive months limits the availability of floral resources to often very brief and unpredictable periods, which poses a challenge to the maintenance of perennial colonies in highly eusocial bees. Thus, only few highly eusocial bees occur permanently in tropical dry forests, among them some highly adapted species of stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini). In the present review, we discuss the current knowledge on the adaptations to such extreme environments in Melipona subnitida, a stingless bee native to the Brazilian tropical dry forest. Key to the success of this species is not so much heat resistance of foragers, as it is the ability to maintain perennial colonies despite extended dearth periods. After several months of drought, M. subnitida colonies are capable of re-establishing fully functional colonies from nests containing only few dozens of workers. This surprising resilience is based on a quick reaction to precipitation-driven increase in floral resource availability, mainly owing to selective foraging at high-profit resources and an immediate up-regulation of brood production once food storage conditions improve.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

While FM (frequency modulation) bats are strictly sensitive to the frequency ranges of their orientation signals or prey-generated noise, CF-FM (constant frequency-FM) bats have a disproportionate number of neurons tuned to frequencies near the CF component of their orientation sounds, and most of them are on–off responders. Furthermore, the inferior collicular neurons of the CF-FM bats discharged as single-on or double-on responders to CF-FM stimuli. To further study the differences in auditory signal processing of these two types of bats, as the first step we conducted an evoked potential response study in the inferior colliculus of the CF-FM bat, Hipposideros pratti and the FM bat, Pipistrellus abramus using CF, FM and CF-FM stimuli. The results showed that the CF sounds always evoked collicular on- and off-responses in CF-FM bats, but the FM bats only had on-responses to both CF and FM sounds, indicting species-specific neural circuits. However, when stimulated with CF-FM sounds, collicular responses were evoked by both the CF and FM components from both FM and CF-FM bats, suggesting they have some generic neural circuit.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hawkmoths use visual and olfactory cues including CO2 and humidity to detect and recognise rewarding flowers; they find the nectary in the flowers by means of mechanoreceptors on the proboscis and vision, evaluate it with gustatory receptors on the proboscis, and control their hovering flight position using antennal mechanoreception and vision.

Current acclimation theory suggests that when daily variation is large and unpredictable ectotherms should not acclimate but should evolve wide performance breadths, allowing maintenance of performance across a wide thermal range. The subtropical intertidal zone, however, experiences a large amount of daily thermal variation, but daily means and ranges shift in predictable ways with season, where daily and seasonal variation is roughly equal. We predicted that animals in this habitat would maintain their capacity to acclimate and that performance breadth would not be altered by acclimation to maintain function with rapidly fluctuating daily temperatures. We tested our prediction using a subtropical goby, Bathygobius cocosensis, which lives in tide pools that vary widely, over days and seasons. We exposed B. cocosensis to winter (12−17 °C) and summer (30−35 °C) thermal conditions for six weeks and then measured the thermal dependence of burst swimming speed, routine and maximum metabolic rate, and ventilation rate between 12 and 36 °C. B. cocosensis exhibited an acclimation response for burst swimming speed, maximum metabolic rate and metabolic scope, but acclimation did not alter the shape of acute thermal performance curves. These results indicate that thermal acclimation can occur when short-term thermal variability is large and equal to seasonal variation, and wide performance breadths can be maintained with acclimation in heterogeneous environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We quantified the absolute aerobic scope of house and Spanish sparrows, Passer domesticus and P. hispaniolensis, respectively, before and during sequential stages of their moult period. The absolute aerobic scope (AAS) is the difference between maximum metabolic rate (MMR) during peak locomotor activities and minimum resting metabolic rate (RMRmin), thus representing the amount of aerobic power above that committed to maintenance needs available for other activities. As expected, RMRmin increased over the moult period by up to 40 and 63% in house and Spanish sparrows, respectively. Surprisingly, the maximum metabolic rates also decreased during moult in both species, declining as much as 25 and 38% compared with pre-moult values of house and Spanish sparrows, respectively. The concurrent changes in RMRmin and MMR during moult resulted in significant decreases in AAS, being up to 32 and 47% lower than pre-moult levels of house and Spanish sparrows, respectively, during moult stages having substantial feather replacement. We argue that the combination of reduced flight efficiency due to loss of wing feathers and reduced aerobic capacity places moulting birds at greater risk of predation. Such performance constraints likely contribute to most birds temporally separating moult from annual events requiring peak physiological capacity such as breeding and migration.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Surprisingly, they were unable to differentiate between different (perceivable) amino acids, but they distinguished between different concentrations of lysine. Consequently, bumblebees seem to possess amino acid receptors at the tip of their antennae, which enable a general perception of those solute amino acids that have an additional functional group (besides the common amino and carboxylic groups).

We synthesized these components, tested them on antennae of male and female flies, and confirmed their biological activity. Overall, our data show that half of the volatiles emitted from C. stenantha flowers are perceived by male and female fly pollinators and are potentially important for flower–fly communication in this pollination system. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of the electrophysiologically active components in the life of scatopsid fly pollinators, and to fully understand the pollination strategy of C. stenantha.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

They can differentiate between flowers that differ only in their patterning of scent, surface texture, temperature, or electrostatic charge, in addition to visual patterns. As recently shown, bumblebees trained to discriminate between nonvisual scent patterns can transfer this learning to visually patterned flowers that show similar spatial patterning to the learnt scent patterns. Bumblebees can, therefore, transfer learnt patterns between different sensory modalities, without needing to relearn them. We used differential conditioning techniques to explore whether cross-modal transfer of learnt patterns also occurred between visual and temperature patterns. Bumblebees that successfully learnt to distinguish rewarding and unrewarding temperature patterns did not show any preferences for the corresponding unlearnt visual pattern. Similarly, bumblebees that learnt visual patterns did not transfer these to temperature patterns, suggesting that they are unable to transfer learning of temperature and visual patterns.

ROS are mainly produced through aerobic metabolism and vary in response to changes in energetic requirements, whereas antioxidants may be enhanced, depleted or show no changes in response to changes in ROS levels. We investigated the repeatability, within-individual variation and correlation across different conditions of two plasmatic markers of the oxidative balance in 1108 samples from 635 free-living adult collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). We sought to manipulate energy constraints by increasing wing load in 2012 and 2013 and by providing additional food in 2014.

We also investigated whether the experimental treatments modified the correlation between markers. Antioxidant defences were repeatable (range of repeatability estimates = 0.128–0.581), whereas ROMs were not (0–0.061). Antioxidants varied neither between incubation and nestling feeding nor between sexes. ROMs increased from incubation to nestling feeding in females and were higher in females than males. Antioxidant defences and ROM concentration were globally positively correlated, but the correlation varied between experimental conditions and between years.

Obesity also aggravates neural pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease, but this class of comorbidity is less understood. When Drosophila melanogaster (flies) are exposed to high-fat diet (HFD) by supplementing a standard medium with coconut oil, they adopt an obese phenotype of decreased lifespan, increased triglyceride storage, and hindered climbing ability. The latter development has been previously regarded as a potential indicator of neurological decline in fly models of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective was to establish the obesity phenotype in Drosophila and identify a potential correlation, if any, between obesity and neurological decline through behavioral assays and gene expression microarray. We found that mated female w1118 flies exposed to HFD maintained an obese phenotype throughout adult life starting at 7 days, evidenced by increased triglyceride stores, diminished life span, and impeded climbing ability. While climbing ability worsened cumulatively between 7 and 14 days of exposure to HFD, there was no corresponding alteration in triglyceride content. Microarray analysis of the mated female w1118 fly head revealed HFD-induced changes in expression of genes with functions in memory, metabolism, olfaction, mitosis, cell signaling, and motor function. Meanwhile, an Aversive Phototaxis Suppression assay in mated female flies indicated reduced ability to recall an entrained memory 6 h after training.

The strongest effect of humidity, however, involved significant increases in RMR; at Ta = 40 °C, RMR at a humidity of 25 g m− 3 was ~ 40% higher compared to a humidity of 6 g m− 3. Moreover, the interaction between Ta and humidity exerted a significant effect on the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP), evident as an increasing effect of humidity with increasing Ta. Our results, when compared with those of the limited number of previous studies that involved similar ranges of Ta and humidity, reveal that the relative effects of humidity on EWL and RMR vary among avian taxa, and support the notion that the overall effect of high humidity is a reduction in maximum EHL/MHP.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We hypothesized that with acute warming the structure and function of neuronal membranes in the Antarctic notothenioid fish Chaenocephalus aceratus are more vulnerable to perturbation than membranes in the more thermotolerant notothenioid Notothenia coriiceps. Fluidity was quantified in synaptic membranes, mitochondrial membranes, and myelin from brains of both species of Antarctic fishes. Polar lipid compositions and cholesterol contents were analyzed in myelin; cholesterol was measured in synaptic membranes. Thermal profiles were determined for activities of two membrane-associated proteins, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), from brains of animals maintained at ambient temperature or exposed to their critical thermal maxima (CTMAX). Synaptic membranes of C. aceratus were consistently more fluid than those of N. coriiceps (P < 0.0001). Although the fluidities of both myelin and mitochondrial membranes were similar among species, sensitivity of myelin fluidity to in vitro warming was greater in N. coriiceps than in C. aceratus (P < 0.001), which can be explained by lower cholesterol contents in myelin of N. coriiceps (P < 0.05). Activities of both enzymes, AChE and NKA, declined upon CTMAX exposure in C. aceratus, but not in N. coriiceps. We suggest that hyper-fluidization of synaptic membranes with warming in C. aceratus may explain the greater stenothermy in this species, and that thermal limits in notothenioids are more likely to be influenced by perturbations in synaptic membranes than in other membranes of the nervous system.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Recent work demonstrates that glycogen stores are utilized in the E. stoutii heart during anoxia but that these are not sufficient to support the measured rate of ATP production. One metabolic fuel that could supplement glycogen during anoxia is glycerol. This substrate can be derived from lipid stores, stored in the heart, or delivered via the blood. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of glycerol on the contractile function of the excised E. stoutii heart during anoxia exposure. When excised hearts, perfused with metabolite free saline (mf-saline), were exposed to anoxia for 12 h, there was no difference in heart rate, pressure generation (max-dP), rate of contraction (max-dP/dtsys), or rate of relaxation (max-dP/dtdia) compared to hearts perfused with mf-saline in normoxia. However, hearts perfused with saline containing glycerol (gly-saline) in anoxia had higher max-dP, max-dP/dtsys, and max-dP/dtdia than hearts perfused with mf-saline in anoxia. Tissue levels of glycerol increased when hearts were perfused with gly-saline in normoxia, but not when perfused with gly-saline in anoxia. Anoxia exposure did not affect the activities of triglyceride lipase, glycerol kinase, or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This study suggests that glycerol stimulates cardiac function in the hagfish but that it is not derived from stored lipids. How glycerol may stimulate contraction is not known.

Naked mole rats are the most hypoxia-tolerant mammal and do not exhibit a hypoxic ventilatory response to acute or chronic hypoxia but instead rely upon a robust hypoxic metabolic response to tolerate reduced environmental O2. Conversely, physiological responses to hypoxia have not been explored in Damaraland mole rats but given their social and environmental similarities to naked mole rats, we hypothesized that they would exhibit similar physiological responses to hypoxia. We predicted that they would rely primarily on metabolic rate depression when O2 is limited and would not exhibit ventilatory responses to acute or chronic hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Damaraland mole rats to normoxia (21% O2) or progressive hypoxia (12–5% O2), before and after acclimation to chronic hypoxia (8–10 days at 10% O2), and measured ventilatory, metabolic, and thermoregulatory responses. We found that ventilation increased up to fourfold with progressive hypoxia and body temperature decreased ~ 2 °C; however, a hypoxic metabolic response was absent. Following acclimation to chronic hypoxia, ventilation in 21% O2 was ~ twofold higher than in control animals, indicating the occurrence of ventilatory plasticity to hypoxia, and body temperature and metabolic rate were elevated. However, ventilation was not further augmented in acute hypoxia following acclimation to chronic hypoxia, indicating that ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia was atypical of other mammals.

Intensity, complexity or composition of perfumes may encode age (survival) of a male, but how the individual perfume develops over time needs to be clarified. We investigated chemical changes during storage in leg pockets. We injected a mixture of eight perfume compounds into pockets of Euglossa imperialis and only the two most volatile compounds decreased over 12 days. Using a different approach we found significant shifts in quantities of naturally occurring perfume compounds of Euglossa championi over 10 days, with the strongest decreases (up to 70% peak area) in highly volatile minor compounds, e.g. monoterpenes, and noteworthy increases (up to 40%) in some sesquiterpenoids. Corresponding shifts were observed in legs of dried bees, suggesting that no metabolic activity is required for the observed changes to occur. Our results confirm that male orchid bees are generally good at preserving collected perfumes. However, subtle shifts towards heavier compounds in blends may occur over the lifetime of individual bees, e.g. due to evaporation or in-pocket chemical reaction, with old males acquiring a more pronounced base note in their seasoned perfumes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

To begin to understand the neural mechanisms underlying this texture preference behavior, we have determined relevant parameters of leech behavior both on uniform substrates of varying textures, and in a behavior choice paradigm in which the leech is confronted with a choice between rougher and smoother substrate textures at each step. We tested two non-exclusive mechanisms which could produce substrate texture preference: (1) a Differential Diffusion mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to stop moving on a smooth surface than on a rough one, and (2) a Smoothness Selection mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to attach its front sucker (prerequisite for taking a step) to a smooth surface than to a rough one.

Individuals capture location varied in habitat and soil features, allowing the comparison of energetic parameters with ecological characteristics, that can help explain the use of the subterranean environment and dependence of the burrow system. Results showed that M. duodecimcostatus has lower mass independent resting metabolic rate when compared with M. lusitanicus, which may be a response to environmental features of their habitat, such as dryer soils and lower water availability. Thermal conductance increased with body mass and was dependent on the ambient temperature. No significant differences were observed in the daily energy expenditure, but water economy data demonstrated the influence of the water available in the habitat on the energetics of voles. These species may rely on behavioural adaptations and seasonal use of burrows to cope with thermal challenges of subterranean activity and soil constraints.

We found that fish emersed (left water) in response to acutely elevated [H2S] (~ 130–200 µmol l−1). The emersion response to H2S may be influenced by prior acclimation history due to acclimation-induced alterations in gill morphology and/or the density and size of neuroepithelial cells (NECs) on the gills and skin. Thus, we acclimated fish to water (control), H2S-rich water, or air and tested the hypotheses that acclimation history influences H2S sensitivity due to acclimation-induced changes in (i) gill surface area and/or (ii) NEC density and/or size. Air-acclimated fish emersed at significantly lower [H2S] relative to fish acclimated to control or H2S-rich water, but exhibited no change in gill surface area or in NEC density or size in the gills or skin. Despite possessing exceptional H2S tolerance, all fish lost equilibrium when unable to emerse from environments containing extremely elevated [H2S] (2272 ± 46 µmol l−1). Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that impaired blood oxygen transport (i.e., sulphemoglobin formation) causes H2S toxicity in amphibious fishes. In vitro exposure of red blood cells to physiologically relevant [H2S] did not cause a substantial increase in sulphemoglobin formation. We found evidence, however, for an alternative hypothesis that H2S toxicity is caused by impaired oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., cytochrome c oxidase inhibition). Collectively, our results show that amphibious behaviour is critical for the survival of K. marmoratus in H2S-rich environments as fish experience impaired oxidative phosphorylation when unable to emerse.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Therefore, we studied the effects of thermal acclimation on the membrane fatty acid composition and the activities of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) in the skeletal muscle and liver of eastern newts from Maine and Florida. Newts were acclimated to either 6 °C or 28 °C for 12 weeks prior to experiments. Cold acclimation resulted in a lower saturated fatty acid (SFA) content in the muscle membranes of both populations. SFA content in liver was lower in cold compared to warm-acclimated newts from Florida, but acclimation did not affect SFA content in liver membranes of the Maine population. In liver, cold acclimation resulted in a higher monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content in the Florida population and a higher polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content in the Maine population. Regardless of acclimation conditions, the muscle and liver membranes of the Maine population had higher SFA and PUFA contents compared to those of the Florida population. MUFA content of muscle and liver membranes was higher in the Florida population compared to the Maine population. The effect of acclimation on CCO and CS activity was tissue-specific. In muscle, CCO and CS activities were higher in cold compared to warm-acclimated newts in both populations, and CS and CCO activities were higher in the Maine compared to the Florida population. In liver, CCO and CS activity were unaffected by acclimation in the Florida population, but activity was lower in cold compared to warm-acclimated Maine newts.

When resources are scarce, some traits will take priority over others in the degree of their expression. For example, the current reproduction may be sacrificed to enhance survival. Although intuitive from an evolutionary perspective, such priorities must be based on proximate mechanisms that respond to the current conditions. The hormone leptin serves as a signal of energy availability in vertebrates, and has been proposed as a mediator of energy allocation between reproduction and traits that enhance survival, such as the immune system. However, since leptin affects reproduction and immunity in a similar way, it remains unclear which takes priority when energy availability is low. Green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) with increased activity, via exercise training, have a marked decrease in immune function as well as reproduction, especially when calories are restricted. We hypothesized that endurance training and calorie restriction would lower immune and reproductive function due to energy limitation, and supplemental leptin would ‘rescue’ either immune function or reproduction (or both) due to the hormonal signal that energetic resources are available. We found that supplementary leptin rescued immune function in calorie-restricted, trained lizards, but reproduction was not rescued in males or females. This suggests that immune function and reproduction have different sensitivities to leptin in both sexes, or that reproduction is more energy limited and takes low priority even when the signal of energy availability is present.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Hymenoptera range from solitary to advanced social species, providing enticing comparisons for studying sociality and neural trait evolution. Here we argue that measuring the role of sociality in brain evolution will benefit from attending to recent advances in neuroethology and adopting existing phylogenetic comparative methods employed in analysis of non-neural traits. Such analyses should rely on traits we expect to vary at the taxonomic level used in comparative analyses and include phylogenetic structure. We outline the limits of brain size and volumetric interpretation and advocate closer attention to trait stability and plasticity at different levels of organization.

Stemmata were located bilaterally on the antero-lateral surfaces of the head. Beneath the ~ 130 µm diameter lens, we identified a pigmented eye-cup. At its widest point, the eye-cup was ~ 150 µm in diameter. The optic nerve exited the eye-cup opposite the lens. Two distinct regions, asymmetric in size and devoid of pigmentation, were characterized in stemmata cross-sections. We refer to these regions as lobes. Each lobe contained a rhabdom of a radial network of rhabdomeres. Pairs of rhabdomeres formed interdigitating microvilli contributed from neighboring photoreceptor cell bodies. The optic nerve contained 88 axons separable into two populations based on size.

One objective is to reveal how basic ethological concepts developed in the 1930s, such as innate releasing mechanisms and fixed action patterns, have influenced the experimental and theoretical approaches to studying acoustic communication systems in Orthopteran insects. The idea of innateness of behaviors has directly fostered the search for central pattern generators that govern the stridulation patterns of crickets, katydids or grasshoppers. A central question pervading 50 years of research is how the essential match between signal features and receiver characteristics has evolved and is maintained during evolution. As in other disciplines, the tight interplay between technological developments and experimental and theoretical advances becomes evident throughout this review. While early neuroethological studies focused primarily on proximate questions such as the implementation of feature detectors or central pattern generators, later the interest shifted more towards ultimate questions. Orthoptera offer the advantage that both proximate and ultimate questions can be tackled in the same system. An important advance was the transition from laboratory studies under well-defined acoustic conditions to field studies that allowed to measure costs and benefits of acoustic signaling as well as constraints on song evolution.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acclimation temperature on the thermal tolerance, hypoxia tolerance and swimming ability of two endangered fish species in the upper reach of the Yangtze River, namely, the Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) and rock carp (Procypris rabaudi). The fish were acclimated at either 15 °C or 25 °C for a 3-week period. Then, thermal tolerance as indicated by the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and critical thermal minimum (CTmin), hypoxia tolerance as indicated by the aquatic surface respiration (ASR50) and loss of equilibrium (LOE50), swimming performance as indicated by the critical swimming speed (Ucrit), aerobic capacity as indicated by the maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope were measured. As expected, the thermal indicators of both species increased with temperature, and their values at both acclimation temperatures were similar to those of fish living in the Yangtze River. However, both species showed poor hypoxia tolerance compared to most fish species in the Yangtze River, according to previous studies. In particular, Chinese sucker acclimated at a low temperature exhibited an unusually strong decrease in hypoxia tolerance with decreasing temperature (fish usually showed high hypoxia tolerance due to decreased oxygen demand and high environmental oxygen tension at low temperature). Furthermore, Chinese sucker exhibited poorer swimming performance than rock carp (which is also a relatively poor swimmer among the fish species in the Yangtze River) when maintained at a high temperature due to low swimming efficiency, possibly as a consequence of its deep body shape. The difference in Ucrit was magnified at low temperature due to the more profound decrease in metabolic scope in Chinese sucker than in rock carp (55% vs 20%), but Chinese sucker showed a higher resting metabolic rate than rock carp at a low temperature, which is difficult to explain. This result suggested that low hypoxia tolerance and poor swimming performance due to the low cardiorespiratory capacity and (or) non-streamlined body shape of both fish species, especially Chinese sucker, reared at low temperature might be two of the reasons why they are not well adjusted to the change in their natural habitat and have thus declined in recent decades. The underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in the unusual adjustment of the physiological function of Chinese sucker and its ecological relevance must be investigated further.

Hypoxia generally decreases growth and aerobic metabolism prior to hatching, in parallel with eliciting physiological modifications that enhance oxygen delivery. However, it is less-well known whether developmental hyperoxia can drive the opposite effect. Moreover, there is insufficient understanding of stage-specific developmental windows during which ambient oxygen availability may be of greater or lesser impact to incubating embryos. Here, we tested the effects of hypoxia (50% dissolved oxygen: DO, % air saturation) and hyperoxia (150% DO) on the growth, routine aerobic metabolism ($$\dot {M}{{\text{O}}_{{\text{2rout}}}}$$M˙O2rout) and hypoxia tolerance (O2crit) of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) during seven developmental windows throughout incubation. Embryos exposed to hyperoxia (150% DO) did not differ from the normoxic group in growth, $$\dot {M}{{\text{O}}_{{\text{2rout}}}}$$M˙O2rout or O2crit at any developmental window. In contrast, embryos exposed to hypoxia grew slower and had a lower $$\dot {M}{{\text{O}}_{{\text{2rout}}}}$$M˙O2rout, but had higher hypoxia tolerance (lower O2crit) than normoxic and hyperoxic counterparts. Interestingly, these differences were only apparent when the embryos were measured prior to hatching. Larvae (alevins) incubated in hypoxia following hatching grew similarly to normoxia-incubated alevins. Our results provide evidence that Atlantic salmon embryos are most sensitive to hypoxia prior to hatching, probably due to increasing (absolute) oxygen requirements concurrent with restricted oxygen diffusion through the egg. Moreover, the similarities between normoxia- and hyperoxia-incubated salmon demonstrate that embryos are not oxygen-limited under normoxic conditions.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

During this time, hamsters were treated with a synthetic thyroxine, levothyroxine sodium (LTS), the antithyroid drug methimazole, or saline solution (control). Hamster’s food intake, basal metabolic rate (BMR), non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), thyroid hormones, body fat content, mitochondrial state-4 respiration, cytochrome c oxidase, and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT), were measured. Both acclimation to 5 °C and LTS increased serum levels of triiodothyronine, which was associated with increased food and energy intake and BMR. Interestingly, although acclimation to 5 °C also increased NST and UCP1 gene expression in BAT, and decreased body fat content, these changes were not induced by LTS treatment. Finally, exposure to 5 °C reduced the effects of LTS on energy intake and expenditure in specific metabolic markers and organs. Together, these data illustrate that ambient temperature and thyroid hormones can have both independent, and interactive, effects on the metabolic changes in striped hamsters induced by cold acclimation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Two dolphins were trained to produce echolocation clicks and report a change from electronic echoes with a fixed delay of ~ 12.6 ms (~ 9.4 m simulated range) to echoes with delays that alternated (jittered) between successive emitted signals. Jitter delays varied from 0 to 50 µs. Jittered echo-delay thresholds were between 1 and 2 µs—the lowest achievable (non-zero) values with the hardware configuration. Error functions matched the click autocorrelation function near zero jitter delay, and were well within the envelope of the autocorrelation function; however, measured jitter delay thresholds were larger than predictions for a coherent or semicoherent receiver at comparable signal-to-noise ratios. When one of the two alternating jittered echoes was inverted in polarity, both dolphins reliably discriminated echoes at all jittered echo delays, including 0 µs (i.e., only jittering in polarity, not delay). Finally, both dolphins used unusual patterns of click emissions, where groups of echolocation clicks were interspersed with silent gaps. Further tests with sub-microsecond jitter values and various echo signal-to-noise ratios would be necessary for proper direct comparison with jitter detection values obtained for bats.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Fish adaptation to these conditions implies tolerance of both low levels of oxygen availability and reoxygenation. Hypoxia tolerance in fish has been widely studied, but the involvement of mitochondria in the response of fish to rapid hypoxia/reoxygenation stress is less known. Zebrafish, a floodplain species, is likely facing significant changes in dissolved oxygen in its natural environment and displays a moderate ability to tolerate hypoxia. In the present study, we report the effects of an acute hypoxia/reoxygenation stress (H/R) protocol on mitochondrial functionality (respiration, complex activities, rate of H2O2 release) and redox state (level of HPs and protein oxidation) of muscle tissue. In parallel, the animal metabolic performance (routine metabolism, nitrogen excretion and swimming performance) was measured. Additionally, the recovery from H/R was tested 20 h after treatment. A significant stimulation by H/R of muscle mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 release was observed, which was only in part counteracted by stimulation of the antioxidant system, resulting in an increased level of lipid peroxides and protein carbonyls. In parallel, H/R increased the animal oxygen consumption and urea excretion rate and reduced routine activity. A significant strong reduction of endurance at 80% Ucrit was also observed. Most of the altered parameter did not recover 20 h after reoxygenation. These data indicate a significant alteration of zebrafish muscle mitochondrial state after acute H/R, associated with changes in tissue redox state and locomotor performance.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Muscle growth may be influenced by anabolic effects of androgens; however, prior to spring departure, circulating androgens are low in sparrows. A seasonal increase in local androgen signaling may occur within muscle to promote remodeling. We measured morphological parameters, plasma and tissue levels of testosterone, as well as mRNA expression levels of androgen receptor, 5α-reductase (converts testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone), and the androgen-dependent myotrophic factor insulin-like growth factor-1. We studied the pectoralis muscle as well as the gastrocnemius (leg) muscle of male sparrows across three stages on the wintering grounds: winter (February), pre-nuptial molt (March), and pre-departure (April). Testosterone levels were low, but detectable, in plasma and muscles at all three stages. Androgen receptor mRNA and 5α-reductase Type 1 mRNA increased at pre-departure, but did so in both muscles. Notably, mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, an androgen-dependent gene critical for muscle remodeling, increased at pre-departure in the pectoralis but decreased in the gastrocnemius. Taken together, these data suggest a site-specific molecular basis for muscle remodeling that may serve to enable long-distance flight.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We observed the responsiveness and the selectivity of virgin grasshopper females (Chorthippus biguttulus L.) for different features of males’ acoustic signals throughout their life span to detect possible influences of age on the females’ preference functions. In particular, we explored the hypothesis that the females may become less selective with increasing age and, therefore, would start to accept songs that are normally rejected. Such an age effect could relieve the selection pressure on male signal traits. In the majority of animals tested, the general responsiveness decreased with age although a few individuals exhibited an opposite trend. Contrary to the above expectation, there was no indication of a loss of selectivity in older females or an increased acceptance of normally unattractive song models. The timing within the oviposition cycle had a strong effect on responsiveness: near oviposition the general responsiveness increased and with it also the half width of the preference functions. However, highly unattractive song models remained unattractive also near oviposition.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Na+ and Cl− dynamics have been well studied in killifish, but few studies have addressed that of Ca2+. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize Ca2+ fluxes in freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW)-acclimated killifish, their response to salinity transfer, and to elucidate the mechanisms of Ca2+ influx in FW and SW. SW killifish displayed a significantly higher Ca2+ influx rate than that of FW fish, while Ca2+ efflux rates were comparable in both salinities. Ca2+ influx was saturable in FW (Km = 78 ± 19 µmol/L; Jmax = 53 ± 3 nmol/g/h) and influx by SW killifish was linear up to 7 mmol/L Ca2+. In SW-acclimated fish, 36% of Ca2+ influx was attributed to “intestinal Ca2+ intake”, likely caused by drinking, whereas intestinal Ca2+ intake in FW contributed to < 2% of total. Throughout the study, results suggested that “cation competition” in SW modulates Ca2+ influx. Therefore, we hypothesized that SW-acclimated fish actually have a higher affinity Ca2+ influx system than FW-acclimated fish but that it is competitively inhibited by competing SW cations. In agreement with this cation competition hypothesis, we demonstrated for the first time that “extra-intestinal” Ca2+ influx was inhibited by Mg2+ in both FW and SW-acclimated killifish. Following acute salinity transfer, extra-intestinal Ca2+ influx was rapidly regulated within 12–24 h, similar to Na+ and Cl−.

We tested the prediction that the threatened red lark (Calendulauda burra), a species restricted to very arid parts of South Africa and which is not known to drink, exhibits highly efficient evaporative cooling and makes pronounced use of facultative hyperthermia when exposed to high air temperatures (Ta). We also predicted that C. burra possesses similarly low basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total evaporative water loss (EWL) at moderate Ta as reported for species from the deserts of the Middle East. Rest-phase thermoregulation in C. burra was characterized by an unusually low lower critical limit of thermoneutrality at Ta = ~ 21 °C and a BMR of 0.317 ± 0.047 W, the lowest BMR relative to allometrically-expected values yet reported in any lark. During the diurnal active phase, red larks were able to tolerate Ta up to 50 °C, with the onset of panting occurring at Ta = 38 °C. Maximum EWL was 1.475 ± 0.107 g h− 1 at Ta = 50 °C, equivalent to 620% of minimum EWL at thermoneutrality. The maximum ratio of evaporative heat dissipation to metabolic heat production was 1.58, a value towards the lower end of the range reported for passerines.

While lipid transporters are evolutionarily conserved, there are relatively few studies examining mechanisms of lipid acquisition in teleosts and no reports in the primitive and evolutionarily important agnathans. We examined tissue lipid droplet distribution and used gut sac preparations to characterize uptake mechanisms of the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid (OA; 18:1 cis-9), in the Pacific hagfish. OA absorption was carrier-mediated and demonstrated saturable concentration-dependent uptake with an affinity constant of 55 ± 7 µM, and a maximal rate of uptake of 1311 ± 97 pmol cm− 2 h− 1. Additionally, regulation of intestinal transport was demonstrated as feeding significantly increased uptake. To further examine post-prandial effects on fatty acid transport, hagfish were dosed with bovine insulin, which had no effect on OA intestinal acquisition, but did lower plasma glucose. Overall, this is the first evidence for intestinal fatty acid acquisition in an agnathan, which are ideal models for understanding the evolution of nutrient transport processes in vertebrates, and are particularly suited to lipid research owing to their dependence upon this energy source during prolonged periods of fasting.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) in maintaining ionic homeostasis in hilsa while moving across the salt barriers. Hilsa, migrating through marine and brackish waters, did not show any significant decline in NKA activity, plasma osmolality, and plasma ionic concentration. In contrast, all the parameters declined significantly, after the fish reached in freshwater zone of the river. Immunoblotting with NKA α antibody recognized two bands in gill homogenates. The intensity of the higher molecular NKA band decreased, while the other band subsequently increased accompanying the movement of hilsa from marine water (MW) to freshwater. Nevertheless, total NKA expression in marine water did not change prior to freshwater entry. NKCC expression was down-regulated in gill, parallel with NKA activity, as the fish approached to the freshwater stretch of river. The NKA α-1 and NKCC1 protein abundance decreased in freshwater individuals by 40% and 31%, respectively, compared to MW. NKA and NKCC1 were explicitly localized to branchial ionocytes and immunoreactive signal appeared throughout the cytoplasm except for the nucleus and the most apical region indicates a basolateral/tubular distribution. Immunoreactive ionocytes were distributed on the filaments and lamellae; lamellar ionocytes were more in number irrespective of habitat salinity. The decrease in salinity caused a slight reduction in ionocyte number, but not in size and the underlying distribution pattern did not alter.

Type 2-like responses could be induced also by the A-type allatostatin, AstA. However, in bees exposed to QMP, AstA-induced odour generalisation was absent. Effects of AstCCC treatment in young bees were weak, indicating that responsiveness to this peptide changes with age. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that honey bee allatostatins play a role in stress reactivity, but suggest in addition that allatostatin signalling is age dependent and susceptible to modulation by pheromone released by the queen bee.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Virtually, all of this research has concerned frogs indigenous to the temperate regions of its broad range within North America. However, recent investigations have shown that frogs of subarctic populations are extremely cold hardy, being capable of surviving freezing for longer periods and at much lower temperatures as compared to conspecifics from temperate regions. Their exceptional freeze tolerance is partly supported by an enhanced cryoprotectant system that uses very high levels of urea and glucose to limit ice formation, regulate metabolism, and protect macromolecules and cellular structures from freezing/thawing stresses. In the weeks before they begin hibernating, northern frogs undertake radical physiological transitions, such as depletion of fat stores and catabolism of muscle protein, that prime the cryoprotectant system by accruing urea and stockpiling glycogen from which glucose is mobilized during freezing. Concentrations of cryoprotectants ultimately achieved in Alaskan frogs when freezing occurs vary among tissues but generally are higher than those of frogs inhabiting milder climates. This review summarizes the molecular, biochemical, and physiological adaptations permitting this northern phenotype to survive the long and harsh winters of the region.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

However, it remains unclear whether sexual dimorphism varies between breeding seasons for specific brain regions. Auditory event-related potential (ERP) changes were evaluated in the Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) to assess sexual dimorphism and seasonal variations in auditory sensitivity. An acoustic playback experiment using an oddball paradigm design was conducted, in which two conspecific call types were used as deviant stimuli with synthesized white noise as standard stimulus. ERP components were analyzed for the telencephalon and mesencephalon of both sexes in the non-reproductive and reproductive states. Results show that auditory sensitivity is modulated by reproductive status, implying that seasonal plasticity is involved in auditory perception. Moreover, the amplitude of the N1 ERP component (mean amplitudes during the interval occurring 30–130 ms after stimulus onset) is higher in females for the telencephalon and higher in males for the mesencephalon, regardless of reproductive status and acoustic stimulus type. These results show that auditory ERP responses for specific brain regions exhibit sexual dimorphism in the absence of exogenous sexual stimulation during both the two reproductive states in the music frog.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Given the demonstrated role of 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) in mediating many of the silvering-related changes, we investigated the role of 11KT in driving this advanced osmoregulatory ability in the New Zealand short-finned eel (Anguilla australis). Yellow (non-migratory) eels with or without 11KT implants and blank-implanted silver (migratory) eels, either held in freshwater or subjected to seawater challenge, were sampled to determine serum [Na+] and [Cl−], pituitary prolactin mRNA levels, gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity and gill mRNA levels for Na+/K+-ATPase-α1 subunit and for Na+/K+/2Cl− co-transporter-1α-subunit. Developmental stage and 11KT treatment advanced the eels’ osmoregulatory ability. Thus, serum [Na+] and [Cl−] were affected by developmental stage and 11KT treatment upon seawater challenge. However, seawater challenge, not 11KT treatment or developmental stage, produced the strongest and the most consistent effects on A. australis osmoregulatory processes, inducing significant effects in all the relevant parameters we measured. In light of our results and in view of the eel’s marine ancestry, we contend that A. australis, or freshwater eels in general, are highly tolerant and able to adapt quickly to changing salinities even at the yellow stage, which may preclude a critical need for an advanced osmoregulatory ability at silvering.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

However, the light wavelengths (λ’s) used to accomplish this orientation have not been thoroughly documented, nor do we understand why some λ’s are favored over others. We measured nocturnal radiance on the horizon at 20 nm intervals between 340 and 600 nm at two nesting beach sites and then, under laboratory conditions, determined the lowest intensities of those λ’s that induced green turtle and loggerhead hatchlings to crawl toward each light source (a low positive “phototaxis threshold”). Both species were similarly sensitive and were attracted to all λ’s. Radiance measures at all λ’s were greater toward the seaward horizon than toward the landward horizon, providing an important orientation cue regardless of variation in lunar illumination. Previous studies document that both species detect λ’s longer than those that are most attractive. We hypothesize that seafinding is a specialized response mediated by cones that are sensitive to the shorter λ’s (to minimize the effects of dark noise) but such as rods, are especially sensitive to low levels of nocturnal illumination.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Cutaneous and branchial ionocytes were identified using Na+/K+-ATPase immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy. Cutaneous ionocyte abundance significantly increased with SL, but a reduction in ionocyte size and density resulted in a significant decrease in relative ionocyte area. Cutaneous ionocytes in preflexion larvae had a wide apical opening with extended microvilli; however, microvilli retracted into an apical pit from flexion onward. Lamellae in the gill and pseudobranch were first detected ~ 3.3 mm SL. Ionocytes were always present on the gill arch, first appeared in the filaments and lamellae of the pseudobranch at 3.4 mm SL, and later in gill filaments at 4.2 mm SL, but were never observed in the gill lamellae. Unlike the cutaneous ionocytes, gill and pseudobranch ionocytes had a wide apical opening with extended microvilli throughout larval development. The interlamellar fusion, a specialized gill structure binding the lamellae of ram-ventilating fish, began forming by ~ 24.5 mm SL and contained ionocytes, a localization never before reported. Ionocytes were retained on the lamellar fusions and also found on the filament fusions of larger sub-adult yellowfin tuna; however, sub-adult gill ionocytes had apical pits.

Crayfish escape from attack of predators by tailflipping and in response to rostral stimuli crayfish show backward escape swimming following an initial rapid flexion of the abdomen. Since the tailflip is an energetically costly behaviour, the occurrence of a tailflip diminishes if a stimulus is repeatedly applied through habituation. In this study, we have compared the process of this habituation between fed and starved crayfish. We found that in starved animals habituation was enhanced compared to fed animals. The presence of food in the experimental tanks further enhanced habituation of starved animals. Starved crayfish thus showed trade-offs between energy saving and predation risk.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Under high-intensity narrow-band lights and when yellow light is added, the magnetic compass is disrupted: migratory birds no longer prefer their migratory direction, but show other orientation responses. The candidate receptor molecule Cry1a is located in the shortwavelength-sensitive SWS1 cone photoreceptors in the retina. The present analysis of avian retinae after the respective illuminations showed that no activated Cry1a was present under 565 nm green light of medium and high intensity, and hardly any under high intensity 502 nm turquoise, whereas we found activated Cry1a at all three tested intensities of 373 nm UV and 424 nm blue light. Activated Cry1a also was found when 590 nm yellow light was added to low-intensity light of the four colors; yet these light combinations result in impaired magnetic orientation.

Typical ground squirrel hibernation is characterized by prolonged periods of torpor with significantly reduced heart rate, blood pressure, and blood flow, interrupted every few weeks by brief interbout arousals (IBA) during which blood flow fluctuates dramatically. These physiological conditions should increase the risk of stasis-induced blood clots and myocardial ischemia. However, ground squirrels have adapted to survive repeated bouts of torpor and IBA without forming lethal blood clots or sustaining lethal ischemic myocardial damage. The purpose of this study was to determine if ground squirrels are resistant to thrombosis and myocardial ischemia during hibernation. Blood markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, and ischemia, as well as histological markers of myocardial ischemia were measured throughout the annual hibernation cycle. Hibernating ground squirrels were also treated with isoprenaline to induce myocardial ischemia. Thrombin–antithrombin complex levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) during hibernation, while D-dimer level remained unchanged throughout the annual cycle, both consistent with an antithrombotic state. During torpor, the ground squirrels were in a hyperfibrinolytic state with an elevated ratio of tissue plasminogen activator complexed with plasminogen activator inhibitor to total plasminogen activator inhibitor (p < 0.05). Histological markers of myocardial ischemia were reversibly elevated during hibernation with no increase in markers of myocardial cell death in the blood. These data suggest that ground squirrels do not form major blood clots during hibernation through suppression of coagulation and a hyperfibrinolytic state. These animals also demonstrate myocardial resistance to ischemia.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Two types of crawling are known: creeping by muscular waves in terrestrial gastropods such as Helix and сiliary gliding in aquatic gastropods such as Lymnaea. It was found that the smooth muscles that underlie the ciliated epithelium in Lymnaea are involved in gliding and contribute significantly to fast crawling. Thus, the locomotor apparatus is fundamentally the same in both snails and the difference between crawling reflects an adaptation to a habitat. The control of crawling speed is also the same. Tonic contraction, relaxation, and rhythmic contractions are involved in this control. During a locomotor episode, the sole length and crawling speed spontaneously change and directly correlate with each other via the contraction force of the muscle cells in the locomotory waves. Dopamine, unlike ergometrine, decreases the sole length and crawling speed. Serotonin stimulates, increases crawling and determines the number of muscle cells involved in the locomotory waves for each locomotor episode. This control (taking into account heterogeneity) apparently might exist in any other phasic smooth muscle, including vertebrates.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Moreover, in ectothermic species, physiological performance capacity is affected by body temperature. We analyzed two components of locomotor performance in three species of lizards, Phymaturus extrilidus, Liolaemus parvus, and Liolaemus ruibali, in the Puna environment of Argentina. First, we estimated the thermal sensitivity of locomotion by measuring sprint speed at four different body temperatures. We included two measures of sprint speed: initial velocity and long sprint for sustained runs. Based on these data, we calculated the optimal temperature for performance and the optimal performance breadth. We also estimated endurance capacity at a single temperature. Maximum sprint speed for L. parvus was greater than L. ruibali and P. extrilidus in both initial velocity and long sprint. In contrast, L. parvus exhibited lower levels of endurance than L. ruibali and P. extrilidus. However, endurance in L. ruibali exceeded that of P. extrilidus. The species differed in the optimal temperature for the initial velocity with the lowest for L. ruibali (31.8 °C) followed by P. extrilidus (33.25 °C) and then L. parvus (36.25 °C). The optimal temperature for long sprint varied between 32 and 36 °C for all species. We found that all species attained maximum performance at body temperatures commonly experienced during daily activity, which was higher than the thermal quality of the environment. We found evidence for thermal sensitivity in locomotor performance in these species. However, we also show that the broad thermal breadth of performance suggests that the lizards are capable of sustaining near optimal levels of locomotor performance at ambient temperatures that would appear to be suboptimal.

Inverting the alligator results in displacement of the liver, post-pulmonary septum, and the heart. EKG analysis revealed a significant decrease in heart rate following inversion; this decrease was maintained for approximately 45 s after inversion which is in general agreement with the total duration of tonic immobility in alligators (49 s). Doppler ultrasonography revealed that following inversion of the alligator, there was a reversal in direction of blood flow through the foramen of Panizza, and this blood flow had a significant increase in velocity (compared to the foraminal flow in the prone alligator). There was an associated significant decrease in the velocity of blood flow through the primary carotid artery once the alligator was held in the supine position.

The olfactory system of the cockroach utilizes two parallel pathways for encoding of odorant identity and the moment-to-moment succession of odorant concentrations as well as the rate at which concentration changes. This separation originates at the peripheral level of the ORNs (olfactory receptor neurons) which are localized in basiconic and trichoid sensilla. The graded activity of ORNs in the basiconic sensilla provides the variable for the combinatorial representation of odorant identity. The antagonistically responding ON and OFF ORNs in the trichoid sensilla transmit information about concentration increments and decrements with excitatory signals. Each ON and OFF ORN adjusts its gain for odorant concentration and its rate of change to the temporal dynamics of the odorant signal: as the rate of change diminishes, both ORNs improve their sensitivity for the rate of change at the expense of the sensitivity for the instantaneous concentration. This suggests that the ON and OFF ORNs are optimized to detect minute fluctuations or even creeping changes in odorant concentration.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Photoperiods at post-chilling periods affected ovarian development, when the length of pre-chilling periods or the length of chilling periods was shorter, suggesting that these treatments were not enough to complete diapause development. Ovarian development proceeded earlier in chilled and subsequent warmed females than unchilled females. Wing damage was remarkable at post-chilling periods when females were reared under an adequate length of pre-chilling and chilling periods, especially comparing with females under pre-overwintering conditions without chilling, indicating that post-diapause reproductive development was weak in unchilled females.

Part I: delay modulation,"Echolocating bats measure target distance by the time delay between call and echo. Target movement such as the flutter of insect wings induces delay modulations. Perception of delay modulations has been studied extensively in bats, but only concerning how well bats discriminate flutter frequencies, never with regard to flutter magnitude. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo delay that were independent of call repetition rate, mimicking fluttering insect wings. We show that in the frequency-modulating (FM) bat Phyllostomus discolor, the sensitivity for modulations in echo delay depends on the rate of the modulation, with bats being most sensitive at modulation rates below 20 Hz and above 50 Hz. The very short duration of their calls compels FM bats to evaluate slow modulations (< about 100 Hz) across entire echo sequences. This makes them susceptible to interference between their own call repetition rate and the modulation rate. We propose that this phenomenon constitutes an echo-acoustic wagon-wheel effect. We further demonstrate how at high modulation rates, flutter sensitivity could be rescued by using spectral and temporal cues introduced by Doppler distortions. Thus, Doppler distortions may play a crucial role in flutter sensitivity in the hundreds of FM species worldwide.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The echolocation call of frequency-modulating bats (FM bats) typically sweeps through a broad range of frequencies within a few milliseconds. The large bandwidth grants the bat high spatial acuity in depicting the target. However, the extremely short call duration and the overall low duty cycle of call emission impair the bat’s capability to detect e.g. target movement. Nonetheless, FM bats constitute more than 80% of all echolocating species and are able to navigate and forage in an environment full of moving targets. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo amplitude reflective of fluttering insect wings independently from other confounding parameters. We show that the FM bat Phyllostomus discolor successfully detected these modulations in echo amplitude and that their performance increased with the rate of the modulation, mimicking faster insect wing-beats.

We investigated how its loss in a white-eyed mutant (W-E) alters the photoreceptor electrophysiological properties, opsin gene expression, and the behavior of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of green-sensitive photoreceptors in W-E cockroaches gave reduced membrane capacitance, absolute sensitivity to light, and light-induced currents. Decreased low-pass filtering increased voltage-bump amplitudes in W-E photoreceptors. Intracellular recordings showed that angular sensitivity of W-E photoreceptors had two distinct components: a large narrow component with the same acceptance angle as wild type, plus a relatively small wide component. Information processing was evaluated using Gaussian white-noise modulated light stimulation. In bright light, W-E photoreceptors demonstrated higher signal gain and signal power than wild-type photoreceptors. Expression levels of the primary UV- and green-sensitive opsins were lower and the secondary green-sensitive opsin significantly higher in W-E than in wild-type retinae. In behavioral experiments, W-E cockroaches were significantly less active in dim green light, consistent with the relatively low light sensitivity of their photoreceptors.

However, the immobilizing drugs can adversely affect the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, yielding data that do not accurately represent the normal, resting state. We hypothesize that these adverse effects can be ameliorated by reversing the immobilizing agent while holding the animal under general anaesthesia. We used habituated sheep Ovis aries (N = 5, 46.9 ± 5.3 kg body mass, mean ± SEM) and goats Capra hircus (N = 4, 27.7 ± 2.8 kg) as ungulate models for large wild animals, and measured their cardiorespiratory function under three conditions: (1) mild sedation (midazolam), as a proxy for the normal resting state, (2) immobilization (etorphine and azaperone), and (3) general anaesthesia (propofol) followed by etorphine antagonism (naltrexone). Cardiac output for both sheep and goats remained unchanged across the three conditions (overall means of 6.2 ± 0.9 and 3.3 ± 0.3 L min−1, respectively). For both sheep and goats, systemic and pulmonary mean arterial pressures were significantly altered from initial midazolam levels when administered etorphine + azaperone, but those arterial pressures were restored upon transition to propofol anaesthesia and antagonism of the etorphine. Under etorphine + azaperone, minute ventilation decreased in the sheep, though this decrease was corrected under propofol, while the minute ventilation in the goats remained unchanged throughout.

Here, we analysed the responses of interneurons in a katydid species that uses long-lasting acoustic trills and compared these with previously reported data for homologous interneurons of a sympatric species that uses short chirps as acoustic signals. Some interneurons of the trilling species respond exclusively to the heterospecific chirp due to selective, low-frequency tuning and “novelty detection”. These properties have been considered as evolutionary adaptations in the sensory system of the chirper, which allow it to detect signals effectively during the simultaneous calling of the sympatric sibling species. We propose that these two mechanisms, shared by the interneurons of both species, did not evolve in the chirper to guarantee its ability to detect the chirp under masking conditions. Instead we suggest that chirpers evolved an additional, 2-kHz component in their song and exploited pre-existing neuronal properties for detecting their song under masking noise. The failure of some interneurons to respond to the conspecific song in trillers does not prevent intraspecific communication, as other interneurons respond to the trill.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Although insects have been used as models in studies on the impact of genetic alterations on cardiac function, there is surprisingly little information on the generation of the inotropic activity in their hearts. The main goal of this study was to investigate the sources of Ca2+ for contraction in Tenebrio molitor hearts perfused in situ, in which inotropic activity was assessed by the systolic variation of the cardiac luminal diameter. Increasing the pacing rate from 1.0 to 2.5 Hz depressed contraction amplitude and accelerated relaxation. To avoid inotropic interference of variations in spontaneous rate, which have been shown to occur in insect heart during maneuvers that affect Ca2+ cycling, experiments were performed under electrical pacing at near-physiological rates. Raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 0.5 to 8 mM increased contraction amplitude in a manner sensitive to L-type Ca2+ channel blockade by D600. Inotropic depression was observed after treatment with caffeine or thapsigargin, which impair Ca2+ accumulation by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). D600, but not inhibition of the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by KB-R7943, further depressed inotropic activity in thapsigargin-treated hearts. From these results, it is possible to conclude that in T. molitor heart, as in vertebrates: (a) inotropic and lusitropic activities are modulated by the heart rate; and (b) Ca2+ availability for contraction depends on both Ca2+ influx via L-type channels and Ca2+ release from the SR.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In both experimental groups, combined right aortic and right subclavian blood flow approximately doubled during swimming. Carotid blood flow increased during swimming in the hypoxia-programmed animals only, and both carotid and left aortic blood flow reached higher values in swimming hypoxic-programmed animals compared to the normoxic group. However, pulmonary blood flow, which increased two to threefold during swimming (in both groups), was higher in normoxic-programmed animals at both rest and swimming. The differences between programming groups were preserved after cholinergic blockade (atropine), but reduced by adrenergic receptor antagonists (propranolol and phentolamine). Propranolol and phentolamine also blunted the incremental increases in blood flows during swimming, which was especially clear in the hypoxia-programmed animals. Alteration in adrenergic control and relative cardiac size (which was increased in hypoxic-programmed alligators) may account for the differences between the experimental groups.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

We describe the effects of electrical stimulation of each vestibular sensor on vestibular-related eye movement in rats and compared the results to other species. We demonstrated that each sensor is responsible for specific bilateral eye movements. We found that the eye movements in rats differed from other species.

During utricular stimulation, the ipsilateral eye moved dorsally in most cases, while the contralateral eye usually moved either caudally, or in extorsion.

Between-species comparisons showed that with all eight odorants, the mice displayed significantly lower threshold values, that is, a higher sensitivity than the spider monkeys, but not than human subjects tested in previous studies. Analysis of odor structure–activity relationships showed that in both species, the type of oxygen-containing functional group and the presence versus absence of a double bond as well as the length of the carbon backbone of the odor stimuli had a systematic effect on detectability.

However, the pattern of torpor varies among individuals within species and populations, even under the same environmental conditions, with significant implications for survival rate and reproductive success. Body mass is one factor that may influence this variation, especially in some small mammals that accumulate fat stores prior to overwintering. However, to our knowledge there has been no previous study examining the detailed relationships between torpor expression and body mass change in small mammals that hoard food as an energy resource during winter. The large Japanese field mouse, Apodemus speciosus, whose winter survival strategy depends on food caches instead of fat stores, displays daily torpor under artificial winter conditions (short-day photoperiod and cold). The present study clarifies the characteristics and patterns of daily torpor and body mass change in this species in the laboratory. Although expression of daily torpor was facilitated progressively as in other species, the observed patterns of torpor expression and body mass change showed considerable individual variation. Moreover, there was no obvious correlation between body mass and daily torpor expression. Therefore, it is suggested that in A. speciosus body mass may not contribute to individual variation of daily torpor during winter. Daily torpor during winter may be adjusted by not only mechanisms common to other small mammals, but also species-specific factors relating to the external or internal reserves of energy in small mammals.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This species survives winters using cryoprotective dehydration as a cold tolerance strategy during which it becomes drastically dehydrated. Several studies have investigated the physiological responses associated with water loss of M. arctica under exposure to freezing temperatures, but little is known of the dynamics of body water and hemolymph osmolality when subjected to gradually increasing drought stress at temperatures above the freezing point. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in which M. arctica was subjected to relative humidities (RH) decreasing from fully saturated conditions to ca. 89%RH over a period of 30 days. During the experiment water content of springtails decreased from about 3 to ca. 0.5 mg mg−1 dry weight. Alongside with water loss, trehalose concentrations increased from nearly nothing to 0.12 mg mg−1 dry weight, which contributed to an increase in hemolymph osmolality from ca. 250 mOsm to at least 7 Osm. All springtails survived water loss down to 0.7 mg mg−1 dry weight and hemolymph osmolality of ca. 4 Osm, and about 60% of the springtails survived with only 0.5 mg water mg−1 dry weight and osmolality of ca. 7 Osm. At this level of dehydration, Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis showed that most, but not all, osmotically active water was lost. It is discussed that the extensive dehydration must be associated with high concentrations of salts potentially causing denaturation and precipitation of cellular proteins. M. arctica is remarkably tolerant of dehydration, but because it does not endure loss of the osmotically inactive water it cannot be categorized as a truly anhydrobiotic species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To test this, we exposed Damaraland and naked mole rats to stepwise increases in environmental CO2 (0–10%) and measured activity, exploratory behaviour, and body temperature. Surprisingly, we found that both species exhibited no differences in movement velocity, distance travelled, zone transitions (exploration), or body temperature at any level of environmental hypercapnia. Conversely, when carbonic anhydrase was inhibited with acetazolamide (50 mg kg−1 intraperitonially, to increase whole-animal acidosis), exploration was significantly elevated relative to hypercapnic controls in both species at all levels of inhaled CO2, and naked mole rat body temperature decreased in > 7% CO2.

In a previous study, we showed that surgical removal of the optic lobes, the principal circadian clock locus in crickets, disrupted their circadian rhythm, but not their circatidal rhythm. In this study, we focused on the pars intercerebralis (PI) because surgical removal of the PI disrupts the circadian rhythm and causes arrhythmic activity in some cricket species. After surgical removal of the PI, the proportion of crickets displaying circatidal rhythm decreased, and more than half of the crickets exhibited arrhythmic activity. Surgical removal of the regions around the PI also caused a similar effect on locomotor activity.

Both are broadly tuned to 1–20 kHz with best frequencies at 1–3 kHz, but NIII is significantly more sensitive than NII. The compound action potentials (CAPs) of both branches increase their first peak amplitudes and areas in response to higher sound levels. NII and NIII differed in their suprathreshold CAP responses to sound frequencies, with stronger responses to 1–3 and 4–6 kHz, for NIII and NII respectively; results that are consistent with tympanal membrane mechanics. These results indicate that butterflies are capable of amplitude and frequency discrimination. Both auditory branches responded to playbacks of the flight and calls of predatory birds.

Changes in animals’ environments can be challenging, particularly for bats, which are small endotherms with large uninsulated flight membranes. Heterothermy is a powerful response used to cope with changing environmental conditions. Recent research has revealed that many tropical and subtropical species are heterothermic and display torpor with patterns unlike those of “classical” heterotherms from temperate and arctic regions. However, only a handful of studies investigating torpor in bats in their natural environment exist. Therefore, we investigated whether the Malagasy bat Macronycteris commersoni enters torpor in the driest and least predictable region in Madagascar. We examined the energy balance and thermal biology of M. commersoni in the field by relating metabolic rate (MR) and skin temperature (Tskin) measurements to local environmental characteristics in the dry and rainy seasons. Macronycteris commersoni entered torpor and showed extreme variability in torpor patterns, including surprisingly short torpor bouts, lasting on average 20 min, interrupted by MR peaks. Torpid MR was remarkably low (0.13 ml O2 h−1 g−1), even when Tskin exceeded that of normothermia (41 °C). Macronycteris commersoni is thus physiologically capable of (1) entering torpor at high ambient temperature and Tskin and (2) rapidly alternating between torpid and normothermic MR resulting in very short bouts.

The muscle mass, MWW/BW, and fiber CSA were found significantly decreased in SOL and EDL of hindlimb unloading rats, but unchanged in hibernating ground squirrels. The MuRF1 expression was increased in both SOL and EDL of unloading rats, while it was only increased in SOL, but maintained in EDL of hibernating ground squirrels. The expression levels of calpain-1 and calpain-2 were increased in different degrees in unloaded SOL and EDL in rats, while they were maintained in EDL and even reduced in SOL of hibernating ground squirrels. Besides, the expression of calpastatin was decreased in unloaded rats, but increased in hibernating ground squirrels. The desmin expression was decreased in unloaded rats, but maintained in hibernating squirrels. Interestingly, the levels of troponin T and troponin C were decreased in both SOL and EDL of unloaded rats, but increased in hibernating ground squirrels with muscle-type specificity. In conclusion, differential calpain activation and substrate-selective degradation in slow and fast muscles are involved in the mechanisms of muscle atrophy of unloaded rats and remarkable ability of muscle maintenance of hibernating ground squirrels.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

One difference is that few enter torpor, especially in temperate environments. The few that do include swallows, none of which live throughout the year in cold-temperate environments, because their food, flying insects, is not available in winter and no passerine is known to hibernate. They seasonally migrate to warm-temperate and tropical environments. We present data on the energetics of the Rifleman (Acanthisitta chloris), a small, insectivorous member of the Acanthisittidae, a passerine family endemic to temperate New Zealand. This family is considered to be the sister taxon to all living passerines, which raises the question whether its physiological and behavioral characteristics reflect its evolutionary status in a manner that distinguishes it from other passerines. Only two of the eight known species in this family survive; four of the extinct species were flightless, a condition that evolved independently three times and is almost absent from other passerines. The Rifleman readily enters torpor, which is facilitated by its small mass. It enters torpor at ambient temperatures that are commonly encountered in its wet, cool-to-cold environment. As a result, its body temperature and rate of metabolism are highly variable. An estimate of the basal rate of metabolism is similar to that expected from body mass. Unlike some  torpor-prone birds, the Rifleman is a permanent resident in a temperate environment. This residency is possible, because the Rifleman gleans insect prey from surfaces, which does not require insects to have high body temperatures for activity. Its only living relative, the endangered, insectivorous Rock Wren (Xenicus gilviventris), is a permanent resident at altitudes from ca. 1000 to 2500 m in the mountains of South Island, New Zealand. There it faces severe winter conditions that are not avoided by descent to lower altitudes. Its response to these conditions may be an extended period of torpor. The repeated evolution of a flightless condition possibly reflects some distinctive property of the acanthisittids. The evolution of torpor and a flightless condition in acanthisittids may have facilitated their survival on a geographically isolated, temperate landmass, and these character states permitted by the absence of endemic mammalian predators.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This paper describes ion transport mechanisms present in the plasma membranes of branchiostegite epithelial cells and the effects of pH on the uptake of 45Ca by these processes. Partially purified membrane vesicles (PPMV) of branchiostegite cells were produced by a homogenization/centrifugation method that has previously been used to define ion transport processes in both crab and lobster gill tissues. In the present study, lobster branchiostegite PPMV 45Ca uptake was highest at pH 8.5 and lowest at pH values between 6.0 and 7.0 (p < 0.02). At pH 8.0, 45Ca uptake was a biphasic process consisting of a saturable process at low [Ca] and a linear process at higher [Ca]. At pH 6.0, 45Ca uptake was only a linear process and paralleled linear uptake at pH 8.0. A valinomycin/K+-induced membrane potential (PD, inside negative) doubled 45Ca uptake at pH 7.0 above that in the absence of a PD (p < 0.05). An induced PD at pH 8.0 did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect 45Ca uptake observed in the absence of a PD, but was threefold greater than uptake at pH 7.0 in the absence of a PD (p < 0.05). Amiloride (2 mM) did not affect 45Ca uptake at pH 8.0, but 2 mM amiloride + 100 µM verapamil reduced uptake by approximately 50%. In the presence of both 2 mM amiloride + 100 µM verapamil, 15 s 45Ca influx at pH 8.5 was a hyperbolic function of [Ca] (0.1–5 mM) (Km = 4.2 ± 0.3 mM; Jmax = 9792 ± 439 pmol/mg protein × 15 s). 45Ca influxes at pH 7.5 under the same conditions were also hyperbolic with Km = 8.3 ± 1.4 mM; Jmax = 10732 ± 1250 pmol/mg protein × 15 s. Km values were significantly different (p < 0.05), but Jmax values were not (p > 0.05). These results suggest that 45Ca uptake by lobster branchiostegites may have occurred by the combination of diffusion through a verapamil-inhibited calcium channel and carrier-mediated transport by amiloride-insensitive, electroneutral, 1Ca2+/2H+ antiporters. Decreased pH, as might occur during ocean acidification, did not appear to modify calcium diffusion through the channels, but protons acted as competitive inhibitors of calcium transport by carrier-mediated antiport. Decreased calcium uptake with continued ocean acidification may significantly affect calcification processes during periodic molting, potentially influencing mortality.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

It has been proposed that elephants are heterothermic, but body temperature never has been measured in elephants over 24 h at environmental temperatures higher than body temperature, where elephants would have to rely on evaporative cooling to maintain homeothermy. We used ingested temperature data loggers to record core temperature of four partly free-ranging savanna elephants exposed to high solar radiation and environmental temperatures that exceeded core temperature (> 36 °C) in their natural habitat. The elephants maintained core temperature at an average 36.6 °C within narrow daily limits of about 1.3 °C. While mean 24-h core temperature increased with maximum air temperature, it did not increase with mean air temperature. Maximum and minimum daily core temperatures also did not change with maximum air temperatures. As a result, core temperature range remained constant despite large variations in daily air temperatures.

The ratio of intracellular glucose/plasma glucose was always higher than one in liver for all species consistent with a diffusion gradient from the tissue to the plasma. In all other tissues in Atlantic cod, cunner, and rainbow trout the diffusion gradient was from the plasma to the intracellular space. In short-horned sculpin, the mean ratio in heart and white muscle exceeded one and in winter flounder the ratio was significantly greater than one at 5.97 and 2.92 for heart and muscle, respectively. The presence of an active glucose 6-phosphatase in white muscle could account for elevated amounts of free glucose. The white muscle of all species displayed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and in winter flounder the activity was as high in white muscle as in liver suggesting that gluconeogenesis may be associated with a relatively high-muscle glucose content. The glycogen content was highest in liver followed by heart with lower amounts in all other tissues. There was an inverse correlation between heart glycogen content and plasma glucose concentration when all species were included. It is contended that in species with low plasma glucose, heart glycogen is accumulated at a slow rate under normoxia, to be called upon under hypoxic conditions when the gradient for inward diffusion is unfavourable for high rates of glucose metabolism.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

These flights are characterised by a succession of arcs or loops of increasing radius centred around the nest, with an incremental increase in ground speed, which requires precise control of the flight manoeuvres by the insect. Here, we investigated the role of optic flow cues in the control of learning flights by manipulating spatial texture in the ventral and panoramic visual field. We measured height, lateral displacement relative to the nest and ground speed during learning flights in bumblebees when ventral and panoramic optic flow cues were present or minimised, or features of the ground texture varied in size. Our observations show that ventral optic flow cues were required for the smooth execution of learning flights. We also found that bumblebees adjusted their flight height in response to variations of the visual texture on the ground. However, the presence or absence of panoramic optic flow did not have a substantial effect on flight performance. Our findings suggest that bumblebees mainly rely on optic flow information from the ventral visual field to control their learning flights.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

By coordinating cyclical lateral trunk flexion and limb movements, these animals are very mobile and show extraordinary maneuverability. The dynamic and static stability displayed in complex and changing environments are highly correlated with such lateral bending patterns. The axial dynamics of their compliant body can also be critical for achieving energy-efficient locomotion at high velocities. In this paper, lateral undulation is used to characterize the bending pattern. The production of ground reaction forces (GRFs) and the related center of mass (COM) dynamics during locomotion are the fundamental mechanisms to be considered. Mainly based on research on geckos, which show unrestricted movement in three-dimensional space, we review current knowledge on the trunk flexibility and waveforms of lateral trunk movement. We investigate locomotion dynamics and mechanisms underlying the lateral undulation pattern. This paper also provides insights into the roles of this pattern in obtaining flexible and efficient walking, running, and climbing. Finally, we discuss the potential application of lateral undulation patterns to bio-inspired robotics.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

This notion, although supported by some observations, has also generated considerable controversy since its inception. As an alternative, Paulo Jorge and colleagues formulated in 2009 the olfactory-activation hypothesis, which states that atmospheric odorants do not provide navigational information but, instead, activate a non-olfactory path integration system. However, this hypothesis is challenged by an investigation authored by Anna Gagliardo and colleagues and published in the current issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A.

We investigated the effects of Luther Marsh DOC, a dark allochthonous DOC, on ion regulation and N-waste excretion of zebrafish acutely exposed to either neutral or low pH in ion-poor water. In the first experiment, simultaneous exposure to pH 4.0 and DOC greatly attenuated the stimulation of Na+ diffusive losses (JoutNa), and prevented the blockade of Na+ uptake (JinNa) seen in zebrafish exposed to pH 4.0 alone, resulting in much smaller disturbances in Na+ net losses (JnetNa). DOC also attenuated the stimulation of net Cl− losses (JnetCl) and ammonia excretion (JnetAmm) during acidic challenge. In the second experiment, zebrafish acclimated to DOC displayed similar regulation of JinNa and JoutNa, and, therefore, reduced JnetNa at pH 4.0, effects which persisted even when DOC was no longer present. Protective effects of prior acclimation to DOC on JnetCl and JnetAmm at pH 4.0 also occurred, but were less marked than those on Na+ balance. Urea fluxes were unaffected by the experimental treatments. Overall, these effects were clearly beneficial to the ionoregulatory homeostasis of zebrafish at low pH, and were quite similar to those seen in a recent parallel study using darker DOC from the upper Rio Negro. This suggests that dark allochthonous DOCs share some chemical properties that render fish tolerant to ionoregulatory disturbances during acidic challenge.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Both species use protein as the main energy substrate and decrease the hepatosomatic index when exposed to reduced pH relative to the control. The observed changes may be associated with changes in the activity of enzymes related to osmoregulation, the use of amino acids as osmotic effectors of cell volume control and recovery, and the Bohr effect, and, because the gills are multifunctional organs related to osmoregulation, the changes may be related to acid–base control, nitrogen excretion, and respiration, with a change in one of these functions bringing about changes in the others.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To better understand the role of thyroid hormones in avian development, we examined autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure while manipulating thyroid hormone levels in the late stage embryonic Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). Thyroid hormone levels were manipulated on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period with the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole (MMI), triiodothyronine (T3), or saline. On day 25 of incubation, autonomic tone on cardiovascular function was studied by injections of cholinergic and adrenergic receptor antagonists. Embryos from all treatment groups expressed a cholinergic and β-adrenergic tone on heart rate at this age. Cholinergic blockade with atropine produced a larger change in heart rate in the hyperthyroid animals compared with euthyroid animals. In response to β-adrenergic blockade, hyperthyroid conditions produced a larger decrease in heart rate compared with euthyroid animals, with no change in mean arterial blood pressure. In response to α-adrenergic blockade, mean arterial blood pressure decreased in the euthyroid animals and more developed hyperthyroid animals.

Its protective properties in bacteria and some populations of isolated cells subjected to different stressors are reported; however, little is known on its effects against a commonly used compound, ethanol (ETH).

In the present study, we determined the following parameters: immobilisation, heart rate, thoracic limb movement, catalase (CAT) activity, and nitric oxide species (NOx) level. Our study revealed that both concentrations of ETH alone induced immobilisation and decrease of swimming velocity, heart rate, and thoracic limb activity; however, catalase activity and NOx levels were increased. On the other hand, the animals exposed to the combinations of ETH + ECT showed a reduced immobilisation and alleviated inhibition of heart rate and thoracic limb activity, lower increase of CAT activity, and NOx level when compared to the crustaceans subjected to ETH alone. The most distinct alleviation of toxic effects was noted in the combinations in which the highest concentration of ECT were used.

They are predicted to adjust their daily energy expenditure (DEE) during periods of food scarcity. Adjustments of DEE to changes in food availability have been well-studied in species in temperate zones during winter, but less so in species enduring seasonal droughts. Likely mechanisms regulating DEE involve adjustments of activity and maintenance metabolism. Species that experience seasonal droughts and changes in food availability, like the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), are appropriate model organisms to study the regulation of seasonal changes of DEE. We quantified DEE using the ‘doubly labelled water’ method, measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), and concomitantly determined activity levels using all-day focal observations of 69 free-living striped mice in the cold moist season with high food availability and the hot dry season with low food availability. Striped mice decreased their DEE in the food scarce dry season using multiple mechanisms, especially reductions in RMR, and reduced overall physical activity. This was further facilitated passively by reduced thermoregulatory costs. Our study demonstrates that animals reduce DEE via active and passive mechanisms in food-restricted environments, and highlights that several environmental factors should be considered simultaneously when aiming to understand how animals cope with harsh environments.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

By varying leg attachment, leg flexion, and body posture, we identify important influences on the amplitude and frequency parameters of transmitted vibrations. The legs respond best to relatively high-frequency vibration (200–2000 Hz), but in strong dependence on the leg position; the response peak shifts progressively over 500–1400 Hz towards higher frequencies following leg flexion. The response is amplified most strongly on the tibia, where specialised vibrosensory organs occur, and the response amplitude increases with the increasing frequency. Leg responses peaking at 800 and 1400 Hz closely resemble the tuning of the intermediate organ receptors in the proximal tibia of T. neglectus, which may be highly sensitive to positional change. The legs of free-standing animals with the abdomen touching the vibrating substrate show a secondary response peak below 150 Hz, induced by body vibration. Such responses may significantly increase the sensitivity of low-frequency receptors in the tibial accessory organ and the femoral chordotonal organ.

Responses of SO and DO neurons were obtained by in vivo intracellular recordings and examined for different stimulus amplitudes and durations. Our results revealed that response patterns of SO neurons were unaffected by changes in amplitude and duration of CF-FM stimuli. However, the excitability of DO neurons increased with prolonged CF duration and higher amplitude of CF-FM stimuli.

While the three photoreceptor types comprise the ‘color space’ at the perceptual level, preferential excitation of one or two of the photoreceptor types has been shown to play an important role in innate color preferences of bumble bees. Bees have been shown to exhibit strong attraction to fluorescence emission exclusively in the blue spectral region. It is not known if emission exclusively in the green spectral region produces similar attraction. Here, we examined responses of wild bees to traps designed to selectively stimulate either the blue or the green photoreceptor using sunlight-induced fluorescence in the 420–480 or 510–540 nm region, respectively. Additionally, we probed how subtle changes in the spectral characteristics of the traps affect the bee captures once a highly selective excitation of the blue photoreceptor is achieved. It was established that selective excitation of the green photoreceptor type was not attractive, in contrast to that of the blue photoreceptor type. However, once a highly selective excitation of the blue photoreceptor type (at ~ 400–480 nm) was achieved, the wild bees favored strong excitation at 430–480 nm over that in the 400–420 nm region.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Castniidae) is a large, diurnally active palm pest. Its compound eyes consist of ~ 20,000 ommatidia and have apposition optics with interommatidial angles below 1°. The ommatidia contain nine photoreceptor cells and appear structurally similar to those in nymphalid butterflies. Two morphological ommatidial types were identified. Using the butterfly numbering scheme, in type I ommatidia, the distal rhabdom consists exclusively of the rhabdomeres of photoreceptors R1–2; the medial rhabdom has contributions from R1–8. The rhabdom in type II ommatidia is distally split into two sub-rhabdoms, with contributions from photoreceptors R2, R3, R5, R6 and R1, R4, R7, R8, respectively; medially, only R3–8 and not R1–2 contribute to the fused rhabdom. In both types, the pigmented bilobed photoreceptors R9 contribute to the rhabdom basally. Their nuclei reside in one of the lobes. Upon light adaptation, in both ommatidial types, the rhabdoms secede from the crystalline cones and pigment granules invade the gap. Intracellular recordings identified four photoreceptor classes with peak sensitivities in the ultraviolet, blue, green and orange wavelength regions (at 360, 465, 550, 580 nm, respectively). We discuss the eye morphology and optics, the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, and the adaptation to daytime activity from a phylogenetic perspective.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We studied the sensitivity of Black Ducks to perturbations in food supply that often result from disturbances by storms, predators, and people. In the paper, we characterize the responses of captive Black Ducks to shifts in food quality and availability during winter and apply those measures to a comparison of wild birds. Captive ducks that were fed intermittently (3 consecutive days/week) compensated for fasted days to achieve similar body mass and body fat to control birds that were fed every day on both animal- and plant-based diets. However, birds that were fed intermittently expended 15% more energy each day than controls when both groups were fed (536 vs. 464 kJ/kg0.75), which indicates that variable food supply increases the costs of maintenance and thus reduces the number of birds that can be supported on the same resource of food without interruptions to foraging. Egg production was not affected by diet quality provided in spring or by the frequency of feeding during the preceding winter months. Black Ducks lost body fat through winter in captivity and in the wild. Fat stores of birds in New Jersey were greater than those of birds in Maine (13.3 vs. 8.3% of body mass) in January, which reflected the high energy demands of cold temperatures in Maine. Values for ∂15N were greater in Maine than in New Jersey for both red blood cells and plasma, which indicated a consistent diet of marine invertebrates in Maine. Greater isotopic variation in red blood cells indicated that diets were more diverse in New Jersey than in Maine for both ∂15N (9.7 ± 1.1 vs. 11.2 ± 0.4‰) and for ∂13C (− 15.1 ± 2.2 vs. − 13.8 ± 1.4‰). Plasma ∂13C was enriched over red blood cells in wild birds especially those with low fat stores, which suggested birds with low energy stores were shifting diets. Black Ducks can compensate for disturbances in feeding by increasing intakes if they have access to high quality wetlands where they are able to find abundant food. High energy demands at cold temperatures may constrain fat stores and thus the tolerance of feeding disturbances especially at the northern limits of the winter range. We hypothesize that decreasing variation in diet may indicate an increase in vulnerability to disturbance in winter when body fat is low. Recent efforts to assess and improve habitat quality of Black Ducks could be enhanced by monitoring the body composition and diet of birds to assess their vulnerability to disturbances in food supply and energy demands.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

When water needs to be conserved, the renal medulla produces concentrated urine. Central to this process of urine concentration is an osmotic gradient that increases from the corticomedullary boundary to the inner medullary tip. How this gradient is generated and maintained has been the subject of study since the 1940s. While it is generally accepted that the outer medulla contributes to the gradient by means of an active process involving countercurrent multiplication, the source of the gradient in the inner medulla is unclear. The last two decades have witnessed advances in our understanding of the urine-concentrating mechanism. Details of medullary architecture and permeability properties of the tubules and vessels suggest that the functional and anatomic relationships of these structures may contribute to the osmotic gradient necessary to concentrate urine. Additionally, we are learning more about the membrane transporters involved and their regulatory mechanisms.

Acid–base regulation in gill breathers involves a net increase of internal bicarbonate levels through transmembrane ion exchange with the surrounding water. Successful maintenance of body fluid pH depends on the functional capacity of ion-exchange mechanisms and associated energy budget. For a detailed understanding of the dependence of acid–base regulation on water parameters, we investigated the physiological responses of the shore crab Carcinus maenas to 4 weeks of ocean acidification [OA, P(CO2)w = 1800 µatm], at variable water bicarbonate levels, paralleled by changes in water pH. Cardiovascular performance was determined together with extra-(pHe) and intracellular pH (pHi), oxygen consumption, haemolymph CO2 parameters, and ion composition. High water P(CO2) caused haemolymph P(CO2) to rise, but pHe and pHi remained constant due to increased haemolymph and cellular [HCO3−]. This process was effective even under reduced seawater pH and bicarbonate concentrations. While extracellular cation concentrations increased throughout, anion levels remained constant or decreased. Despite similar levels of haemolymph pH and ion concentrations under OA, metabolic rates, and haemolymph flow were significantly depressed by 40 and 30%, respectively, when OA was combined with reduced seawater [HCO3−] and pH. Our findings suggest an influence of water bicarbonate levels on metabolic rates as well as on correlations between blood flow and pHe. This previously unknown phenomenon should direct attention to pathways of acid–base regulation and their potential feedback on whole-animal energy demand, in relation with changing seawater carbonate parameters.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

To evaluate the role of these attachment devices in generating attachment, behavioural experiments testing locomotion of insects with ablated pulvilli, shaved hairs and cut-off claws were performed. Using traction force experiments, insect attachment performance was evaluated on artificial substrates characterised by different roughness and on two substrates with different surface energies in the air and under water. To examine the contact area of attachment devices during resting, pulling and inverted walking, intact insects and those without claws were video-recorded using a high-speed camera. The present data reveal a great involvement of pulvilli in insect attachment on all the tested surfaces, while the hairy pad seems to have a role in producing friction forces only on smooth surfaces and on surfaces with intermediate roughness. The hairy pad was revealed to be important in adhesion to hydrophobic substrates under water, a function that could be relevant for N. viridula insects in consideration that many plant leaves tend to have hydrophobic surfaces and may be often covered by water film.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Using Neurobiotin™ as a retrograde neuronal tracer, specific motor nerves or individual labral muscles were stained. Results show that the labral muscles receive innervation from tritocerebrum and suboesophageal ganglion. The axons of many motor neurons use three different pathways to cross the midline in the periphery to innervate ipsi- and contralateral muscles. Intracellular recordings from fibers of individual muscles and simultaneous recordings from motor neurons imply that the labral muscles lack inhibitory innervation. The location of motor neurons in both tritocerebrum and suboesophageal ganglion supports the notion that the labrum is innervated by the so-called intercalary segment. That many of the efferent axons cross the midline in the periphery might be explained by the hypothesis that the labrum derives from a fusion of appendages.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The giant clam, Tridacna squamosa, harbors nitrogen-deficient symbiotic zooxanthellae, and normally conducts light-enhanced ammonia absorption to benefit the symbionts. Nonetheless, it can excrete ammonia when there is a supply of exogenous nitrogen or exposed to continuous darkness. This study aimed to elucidate the role of AMT1 in the ctenidium of T. squamosa by cloning and characterizing the AMT1/AMT1, determining its subcellular localization, and examining changes in its transcript and protein expression levels in response to light exposure. The cDNA coding sequence of AMT1 from T. squamosa consisted of 1527 bp and encoded 508 amino acids of 54.6 kDa. AMT1-immunofluorescence was detected mainly at the apical epithelium of ctenidial filaments, and it decreased significantly after 12 h of exposure to light. By contrast, the epithelial cells surrounding the tertiary water channels in the ctentidium, which are known to exhibit light-enhanced glutamine synthetase expression and take part in the assimilation of exogenous ammonia in light, did not display any AMT1-immunolabelling. Furthermore, the transcript level and protein abundance of ctenidial AMT1/AMT1 decreased significantly at the 6th and 12th h of light exposure. Taken together, these results indicate that AMT1 might participate in ammonia excretion instead of ammonia absorption and assimilation in T. squamosa. It is probable that the expression levels of AMT1/AMT1 need to be down-regulated during light exposure to achieve light-enhanced ammonia uptake.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Here, we use cue-conflict experiments to investigate the interplay between these two routines in ants, Cataglyphis noda, which start their foraging careers (novices) with learning walks and are then tested at different stages of experience. During their learning walks, the novices take nest-centered views from various directions around the nest. In the present experiments, these learning walks are spatially restricted by arranging differently sized water moats around the nest entrance and thus, limiting the space available around the nest and the nest-feeder route. First, we show that the ants are able to return to the nest by landmark guidance only when the novices have had enough space around the nest entrance for properly performing their learning walks. Second, in 180° cue-conflict situations between path integration and landmark guidance, path integration dominates in the beginning of foraging life (after completion of the learning walks), but with increasing numbers of visits to a familiar feeder landmark guidance comes increasingly into play.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Voles with this experience possessed more OT-but less TH-immunoreactive neurons as compared to the control. Additionally, males with this experience had less D2R and OTR mRNA expression in the NAcc than the control while females had less D2R mRNA expression in the NAcc, but more OTR mRNA expression in the MeA.

We studied the ability of the blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans, to successfully land on a perch moving unpredictably. We tracked the insects landing on a vertical pole moved linearly 6 cm back and forth with sinusoidal changes in velocity. When the moving perch changed direction at frequencies higher than 1 Hz, the damselflies engaged in manoeuvres that typically involved sideways flight, with minimal changes in body orientation relative to the stationary environment. We show that these flight manoeuvres attempted to fix the target in the centre of the field of view when flying in any direction while keeping body rotation changes about the yaw axis to the minimum. We propose that this pursuit strategy allows the insect to obtain reliable information on self and target motion relative to the stationary environment from the translational optic-flow, while minimizing interference from the rotational optic-flow. The ability of damselflies to fly in any direction, irrespective of body orientation, underlines the superb flight control of these aerial predators.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In addition, urea levels were significantly higher in fall-collected frogs than summer-collected frogs in the tissues of heart, brain, kidney, and muscle. The results of differential scanning calorimetry indicated that the ice-nucleating protein was present only in cold-acclimated and fall-collected frogs’ plasma.

Knowledge of ANG II’s contribution to developmental cardiovascular function comes from studies in fetal mammals and embryonic chickens. This is the first study to examine the role of ANG II in cardiovascular control in an embryonic reptile, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Using chronic low (~ 5-mg kg embryo−1), or high doses (~ 450-mg kg embryo−1) of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, we disrupted the RAS and examined the influence of ANG II in cardiovascular function at 90% of embryonic development. Compared to embryos injected with saline, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly reduced by 41 and 72% under low- and high-dose captopril treatments, respectively, a greater decrease in MAP than observed in other developing vertebrates following ACE inhibition. Acute exogenous ANG II injection produced a stronger hypertensive response in low-dose captopril-treated embryos compared to saline injection embryos. However, ACE inhibition with the low dose of captopril did not change adrenergic tone, and the ANG II response did not include an α-adrenergic component. Despite decreased MAP that caused a left shifted baroreflex curve for low-dose captopril embryos, ANG II did not influence baroreflex sensitivity.

During torpor cardiac conduction slowed in a temperature dependent manner, primarily via prolongation along the atrioventricular pathway (PR interval). A close coupling of depolarisation and repolarisation was retained in torpid bats, with no isoelectric ST segment visible until animals reached Tsub <6 °C. There was little change in ventricular repolarisation (JT interval) with decreasing Tsub, or between rest and torpor at mild Ta. Bats retained a more rapid rate of ventricular conduction and repolarisation during torpor relative to other hibernators. Throughout all recordings across seasons (> 2500 h), there was no difference in ECG morphology or heart rate during torpor, and no manifestations of significant conduction blocks or ventricular tachyarrhythmias were observed. My results demonstrate the capacity of bat hearts to withstand extreme fluctuations in rate and temperature throughout the year without detrimental arrhythmogenesis.

Vapor density deficit, the driving force for evaporative water loss, increases exponentially as temperature increases. Acute temperature changes may be the result of daily behavioral thermoregulation of ectotherms, which may influence the among individual variation rates of water loss. The goals of this study were to determine (1) how rates of cutaneous water loss (CWL) and skin resistance (Rs) are affected by acute temperature acclimation, (2) how rates of CWL and Rs vary throughout the day allowing behavioral thermoregulation and (3) the repeatability of CWL and Rs within and among sampling periods. We measured CWL and calculated skin resistance (Rs) of 30 male Sceloporus consobrinus lizards across three summers. We measured CWL on the dorsal and ventral surface of each lizard at 23 °C followed by measurements at 35 °C, and three separate times throughout the day. We found a significant increase in Rs and decrease in CWL at increased acclimation temperatures (35 °C), a significant difference in CWL and Rs throughout the day allowing behavioral thermoregulation, and support for the repeatability of CWL and Rs. Our results demonstrate variability in CWL and Rs in relation to temperature acclimation and thermoregulation, but mixed evidence for repeatability across treatments.

The locomotion sequences were analysed to determine the gait and the various spatiotemporal gait parameters of the limbs. We found that velocity adjustments are accounted for differently by stride frequency and stride length depending on whether the animal showed a symmetrical or an asymmetrical gait. When using symmetrical gaits the increase in velocity is associated with a constant contribution of the stride length and stride frequency; the increase of the stride frequency being always lower. When using asymmetrical gaits, the increase in velocity is mainly assured by an increase in the stride length which tends to decrease with increasing velocity. A reduction in both stance time and swing time contributed to the increase in stride frequency for both gaits, though with a major contribution from the decrease in stance time.

Hereditary hemochromatosis in humans is due to deficiency of hepcidin or resistance to the action of hepcidin. Here, we investigated the role of hepcidin in iron metabolism in one species of pteropodid bat that is prone to iron storage disease [Egyptian fruit bat (with and without hemochromatosis)], one species of pteropodid bat where iron storage disease is rare [straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum)], and one species of bat with a natural diet very high in iron, in which iron storage disease is not reported [common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus)]. Iron challenge via intramuscular injection of iron dextran resulted in significantly increased liver iron content and histologic iron scores in all three species, and increased plasma iron in Egyptian fruit bats and straw-colored fruit bats. Hepcidin mRNA expression increased in response to iron administration in healthy Egyptian fruit bats and common vampire bats, but not in straw-colored fruit bats or Egyptian fruit bats with hemochromatosis. Hepcidin gene expression significantly correlated with liver iron content in Egyptian fruit bats and common vampire bats, and with transferrin saturation and plasma ferritin concentration in Egyptian fruit bats. Induction of hepcidin gene expression in response to iron challenge is absent in straw-colored fruit bats and in Egyptian fruit bats with hemochromatosis and, relative to common vampire bats and healthy humans, is low in Egyptain fruit bats without hemochromatosis. Limited hepcidin response to iron challenge may contribute to the increased susceptibility of Egyptian fruit bats to iron storage disease.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In their natural environment, Formosan wood mice exhibit high locomotor activity, including searching and exploratory behaviours, which is observed similarly in the laboratory environment. How the behavioural responses of Formosan wood mice exhibit in elevated plus maze and marble burying tests remains unclear. How corticosterone levels and central dopaminergic activities are related to the behaviours in these tests is also unclear. This study compared the behaviours of Formosan wood mice with that of C57BL/6J mice using the elevated plus maze and marble burying tests, and measured the corticosterone levels and central dopaminergic activities. Formosan wood mice showed greater locomotor and exploratory activity than the C57BL/6J mice. Similarly, the marble burying and rearing numbers were higher for Formosan wood mice. High locomotor and exploratory behaviours were strongly correlated with corticosterone levels after acute mild restraint stress in Formosan wood mice. The anxiolytic, diazepam, reduced the high exploratory activity, corticosterone levels and central dopaminergic activities. The high locomotor and exploratory behaviours of Formosan wood mice are related to the corticosterone levels and central dopaminergic activities. These data may explain Formosan wood mice dominance in the intermediate altitude of Taiwan.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Hymenoptera, Odonata and Diptera show prominent equatorial fovea-like indentations of the ocellar retinae, where distal receptor endings are furthest removed from the lens surface and receptor densities are highest. In contrast, rhabdomere arrangements are very diverse across insect groups: in Hymenoptera, with some exceptions, pairs of ocellar retinular cells form sheet-like rhabdoms that form elongated rectangular shapes in cross-section, with highly aligned microvilli directions perpendicular to the long axis of cross-sections. This arrangement makes most ocellar retinular cells in Hymenoptera sensitive to the direction of polarized light. In dragonflies, triplets of retinular cells form a y-shaped fused rhabdom with microvilli directions oriented at 60° to each other. In Dipteran ocellar retinular cells microvilli directions are randomised, which destroys polarization sensitivity. We suggest that the differences in ocellar organization between insect groups may reflect the different head attitude control systems that have evolved in these insect groups, but possibly also differences in the mode of locomotion and in the need for celestial compass information.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Osmoregulation may be controlled by the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), a neuropeptide mainly expressed in the eyestalks. In L. vannamei, CHH-B1 and CHH-B2 are CHH isoforms isolated from the eyestalks whose expression is influenced by environmental salinity. It has been suggested that they are involved in the response to salinity stress. To clarify this, we investigated the effect of the recombinant peptides, rCHH-B1 and rCHH-B2, on the osmo-ionic regulation of shrimp acutely exposed to different salinity conditions (8, 26 and 45‰). Both rCHHs promoted differential effects on the osmoregulatory capacity (OC) and the ionoregulatory capacity (IC) for hemolymph Na+ and Cl− during iso-osmotic (26‰) and hyper-osmotic (45‰) transfers. These changes were linked to the changes observed in Na+/K+ ATPase and carbonic anhydrase gene expression in gills, especially under high salinity conditions, suggesting that the hormones may regulate the expression of these genes. Glucose and protein levels measured during acute salinity transfer suggest their roles as sources of metabolic energy for osmotic regulation or as organic osmolytes. These results taken together suggest that both the CHH-B1 and CHH-B2 peptides are important regulators of the physiological response of L. vannamei to acute salinity fluctuations.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Their main characteristic is the selectivity to looming (a 2D representation of an object approach), rather than to receding stimuli. We studied a set of LSNs by performing surface extracellular recordings in the optic nerve of Neohelice granulata crabs, and characterized their response against computer-generated visual stimuli with different combinations of moving edges, highlighting different components of the optical flow. In addition to their selectivity to looming stimuli, we characterized other properties of these neurons, such as low directionality; reduced response to sustained excitement; and an inhibition phenomenon in response to visual stimuli with dense optical flow of expansion, contraction, and translation. To analyze the spatio-temporal processing of these LSNs, we proposed a biologically plausible computational model which was inspired by previous computational models of the locust lobula giant motion detector (LGMD) neuron. The videos seen by the animal during electrophysiological experiments were applied as an input to the model which produced a satisfactory fit to the measured responses, suggesting that the computation performed by LSNs in a decapod crustacean appears to be based on similar physiological processing previously described for the LGMD in insects.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The results showed that RMR scaled with M of the fish by an exponent (b) of 0.833 (bR), which was significantly larger than 0.75. MMR scaled with M by a power of 0.775 (bM), which was significantly lower than 1 and may be due to a small size proportion of red muscle. No difference between bR and bM or correlation between factorial aerobic scope and M was found. However, EPOC scaled positively with M by a power of 1.231, suggesting a constant aerobic capacity and an enhanced anaerobic capacity with fish growth. Mass of the inactive organs scaled with M by a power of 1.005, which was significantly larger than 1 and was negatively correlated with RMR, suggesting that the proportion of inactive organs increases with fish growth, which may contribute to the negative scaling of RMR. Red blood cell surface area (S) did not increase with increasing M, suggesting that the ontogenetic decrease in the surface area to volume ratio of cells may not contribute to the negative scaling of RMR. The predicted bR value (0.846) by the average S (1.746 µm²) differs by only 1.62% from the observed bR value using our previously reported S − bR function in carp, suggesting that the species-specific cell size, rather than its ontogenetic change, affects the metabolic scaling of a species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Their relatively high lower critical temperature of around 20 °C suggests strong sensitivity to cold, thereby limiting their distribution to tropical and subtropical waters. “Cold stress syndrome” affects and kills Florida manatees every year during intense or prolonged cold weather, posing one of the major threats to manatees. However, knowledge regarding manatee thermoregulation is sparse, but essential for effective conservation and management of this threatened species. We measured heat flux in two captive Florida manatees at multiple times of the year, at 41 sites distributed across the entire body surface of each manatee. Heat flux differed significantly between individuals, and among body sites and times of the year. The pectoral flippers and axillae were identified as areas with highest heat exchange. Despite exposure to constant water temperature throughout the year, the manatees in this study had significantly lower heat flux in winter than in summer. We used the measured heat flux values to calculate total heat dissipation in individual manatees. The values estimated this way correspond well with the low metabolic rates estimated in previous studies, confirming the reliability of our novel approach. Our method provides simple and useful options for enhancing manatee welfare by monitoring the animals’ thermal state during potentially stressful activities such as during medical treatment, capture restraints and transportation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

This study investigated the development of freeze tolerance in D. chrysoscelis, analyzing the response of the cryoprotectant system to cold acclimation, freezing, and thawing. Glycerol production was low and unresponsive to acclimation temperature, or duration of acclimation to 5 °C, except for one cold-acclimated frog that presented elevated glycerol in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. Curiously, glycerol concentration in skeletal muscle was higher than that of plasma and liver, in both warm- and cold-acclimated frogs, suggesting glycerol synthesis in muscle. Urea concentration in plasma doubled in response to cold acclimation but did not change during freezing. Freezing induced hepatic glycogen catabolism and an increase in glycerol and glucose in several tissues, although the mobilization dynamics differed between these cryoprotectants, possibly as a result of different transport mechanisms. Although hepatic glucose mobilization was of considerable magnitude, glucose accumulation in peripheral tissues was low and was surpassed by that of glycerol and urea. The muscle production of glycerol and the cold-induced accumulation of urea imply a role for skeletal muscle metabolism in the mobilization of cryoprotective solutes in D. chrysoscelis. The cryoprotectant system of D. chrysoscelis is complex, highly variable, and unique, with glycerol, glucose, and likely urea serving as cryoprotectants.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Fish were exposed to environmental acidosis (pH ~ 6.0) or hypercarbia (≈ 30 torr PCO2) that produced changes in water pH equal to the pH levels of the acidotic water to distinguish the relative roles of CO2 versus H+. We also injected acetazolamide to elevate arterial levels of PCO2 and [H+] in fish in normocarbic water to distinguish between internal and external stimuli. We measured changes in gill ventilation frequency, air breathing frequency, heart rate and arterial blood pressure in response to each treatment as well as the changes produced in arterial PCO2 and pH. Exposure to normocarbic water of pH 6.0 for 1 h did not produce significant changes in any measured variable. Exposure to hypercarbic water dramatically increased air breathing frequency, but had no effect on gill ventilation. Hypercarbia also produced a modest bradycardia and fall in arterial blood pressure. Injection of acetazolamide produced similar effects. Both hypercarbia and acetazolamide led to increases in arterial PCO2 and falls in arterial pH although the changes in arterial PCO2/pH were more modest following acetazolamide injection as were the increases in air breathing frequency. The acetazolamide results suggest that the stimulation of air breathing was due, at least in part, to stimulation of internally oriented CO2/H+ chemoreceptors monitoring blood gas changes.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Dermal photoreception is believed to serve a variety of functions, including rapid color change via specialized cells called chromatophores. In vitro studies of this system among color-changing fish have suggested the use of a phototransduction signaling cascade that fundamentally differs from that of the retina. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify phototransduction genes and compare their expression in the retina and skin of a color-changing fish, the hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus. De novo transcriptomics revealed the expression of genes that may underlie distinct, yet complete phototransduction cascades in L. maximus retina and skin. In contrast to the five visual opsin genes and cGMP-dependent phototransduction components expressed in the retina of L. maximus, only a single short-wavelength sensitive opsin (SWS1) and putative cAMP-dependent phototransduction components were expressed in the skin. These data suggest a separate evolutionary history of phototransduction in the retina and skin of certain vertebrates and, for the first time, indicate an expression repertoire of genes that underlie a non-retinal phototransduction pathway in the skin of a color-changing fish.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Several studies recently demonstrated that tyramine, the biological precursor of octopamine, also affects behaviors independent of octopamine. Here we investigated the involvement of tyramine in agonistic interaction of the male crayfish Procambarus clarkii. When male crayfish fight, larger animals (3–7% difference in body length) are more likely to win. By contrast, direct injection of tyramine or octopamine counteracted the physical advantage of larger animals. Tyramine or octopamine-injected naive large animals were mostly beaten by untreated smaller naive animals. This pharmacological effect was similar to the loser effect in which subordinate larger animals are frequently beaten by smaller animals. Furthermore, loser effects were partly eliminated by either injection of epinastine, an octopamine blocker, or yohimbine, a tyramine blocker, and significantly diminished by injection of a mixture of both blockers. We also observed that tyramine levels in the subesophageal ganglion were remarkably increased in subordinate crayfish after losing a fight. These results suggest that tyramine modulates aggressive levels of crayfish and contributes to the loser effect in parallel with octopamine.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

In this study, we used a candidate gene approach to investigate the patterns of expression of key genes for cooperation and aggression in the brain of a primitively eusocial wasp, Polistes dominula, during colony founding, when multiple foundresses can join the same nest and establish subtle hierarchies of dominance. We used a comparative approach to select candidate genes for cooperation and aggression looking at two previously published studies on global gene expression in wasps and ants. We tested the expression of these genes in P. dominula wasps that were either displaying aggressive behaviour (dominant and single foundresses) or cooperation (subordinate foundresses and workers) towards nestmates. One gene in particular, the egg yolk protein vitellogenin, known for its reproductive role in insects, displayed patterns of expression that strongly matched wasp social rank. We characterize the genomic context of vitellogenin by building a head co-expression gene network for P. dominula, and we discuss a potential role for vitellogenin as a mediator of social interactions in wasps.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

How these muscle properties scale determines, in part, the scaling of performance during movements, such as jump height or distance. Muscle-mass-specific work is predicted to remain constant across a range of scales, assuming geometric similarity, while muscle-mass-specific power is expected to decrease with increasing scale. We tested these predictions by examining muscle morphology and contractile properties of plantaris muscles from frogs ranging in mass from 1.28 to 20.60 g. Scaling of muscle work and power was examined using both linear regression on log10-transformed data (LR) and non-linear regressions on untransformed data (NLR). Results depended on the method of regression not because of large changes in scaling slopes, but because of changing levels of statistical significance using corrections for multiple tests, demonstrating the importance of careful consideration of statistical methods when analyzing patterns of scaling. In LR, muscle-mass-specific work decreased with increasing scale, but an accompanying positive allometry of muscle mass predicts constant movement performance at all scales. These relationships were non-significant in NLR, though scaling with geometric similarity also predicts constant jump performance across scales, because of proportional increases in available muscle energy and body mass. Both intrinsic shortening velocity and muscle-mass-specific power were positively allometric in both types of analysis. Nonetheless, scale accounts for little variation in contractile properties overall over the range examined, indicating that other sources of intraspecific variation may be more important in determining muscle performance and its effects on movement.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

ITDs are thought to be the dominant cue in the low-frequency range, ILDs the dominant cue in the high-frequency range. ITDs and ILDs co-occur. Their interaction and contribution to the lateralisation of pure tones by Mongolian gerbils was investigated behaviourally using cross-talk cancellation techniques for presenting ITDs and ILDs independently. First, ITDs were applied to pure tones with frequencies ≤ 2 kHz to the ongoing waveform, at the onsets and offsets, or in both the ongoing waveform and at the onsets and offsets. Gerbils could lateralise tones only if ongoing ITDs were present indicating that ongoing ITDs are decisive for the lateralisation of low-frequency tones. Second, an ITD was added to 2-to-6-kHz tones with varying ILD. Gerbils’ lateralisation was unaffected by the ITD indicating that a large ILD provides a strong lateralisation cue at those frequencies. Finally, small ILDs were applied to 2-kHz tones with an ongoing ITD, pointing either to the same or opposing sides as the ITD. Gerbils’ lateralisation was driven by the ITD but strongly affected by the ILD indicating that both interaural cues contribute to the lateralisation.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

Each sex may benefit from possessing different thermal performance capacities that would allow them to maximise their fitness relative to their different reproductive roles; especially when performances are closely related to reproductive success. Here, we examine sexual divergence in thermal sensitivities of performance across three populations of the Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) over an extensive latitudinal cline. Using analyses of the thermal sensitivity of routine activity, bite force and sprint speed, we explored whether: (i) males and females differed in their optimal temperatures for performance, (ii) the sexes differed in their thermal sensitivities of performance, and (iii) the degree of sexual divergence in thermal sensitivity varied among the populations. Because male H. frenatus are highly aggressive and frequently engage in combat to gain territories and mating opportunities, we expected males would be active over a wider range of temperatures than females and this would favour broad thermal sensitivity curves for males. In addition, we expected a greater divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the temperate populations that experience greater daily and seasonal thermal variation. We found that males were more active, and had greater bite forces and faster sprint speeds than females, independent of body size. In addition, we found differences between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the tropical population; female H. frenatus were less active and possessed lower sprint speeds at higher temperatures than males. Although H. frenatus from the most variable thermal environments also displayed the broadest thermal performance range, it was the more stable tropical population that exhibited the greatest divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivity of performance. The divergence in thermal physiology that we detected between the sexes of H. frenatus is consistent with the idea that males will derive mating and territorial advantages for maintaining function over a broader range of temperatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

The present study compares the effects of the muscarinic agonist carbamylcholine chloride (CCh 10−8–10−5 M) on electrical activity in isolated atrial and ventricular preparations from dormant frogs (Rana temporaria) caught in January (winter-acclimatized, WA) and from active frogs caught in July (summer-acclimatized, SA). Seasonal differences in the density of potassium acetylcholine-dependent current (IKACh) were also studied in atrial and ventricular myocytes from both summer and winter groups. In atrial myocardium, CCh produced concentration-dependent shortening of action potentials (APs). CCh concentration producing a 50% reduction of AP duration was lower in WA (1.03 × 10−7 M) than SA atria (2.7 × 10−7 M). 10−6 M CCh induced drastic reduction of AP amplitude rendering the tissue unexcitable in both WA or SA atrial preparations. Ventricular preparations showed greater seasonal difference in CCh sensitivity. While 10−6 M induced inexcitability in 50% of tested WA preparations, in SA preparations even 10−5 M CCh was without effect. This striking difference between cholinergic effects in SA and WA frog ventricle could be explained by seasonal changes in the IKACh density. The density of IKACh induced by 10−5 M CCh and measured at 0 mV was 14.4 ± 3.45 pA/pF in WA, but only 1.5 ± 0.4 pA/pF in SA atrial cells. In ventricular cells, the respective values were 2.61 ± 0.56 and 0.71 ± 0.09 pA/pF. Thus, hibernating winter frog has a much greater electrophysiological cholinergic response than active summer frog due to up-regulation of IKACh.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Whilst adult crocodilian cardiovascular responses to changes in temperature have been investigated, similar studies in alligator embryos are limited. We investigated cardiovascular function of embryonic alligators during heating and cooling as well as at different temperatures. We measured arterial blood pressure (Pm) and heart rate (fH) in response to cooling (30–26 °C), heating (26–36 °C), followed by a reciprocal cooling event (36–26 °C) and assessed the cardiac baroreflex at 30 and 36 °C. Embryonic fH increased during heating events and decreased during cooling events, while embryos were hypotensive at 26 and 36 °C, although Pm did not differ between heating or cooling events. There was a clear temperature-dependent heart rate hysteresis at a given embryo’s temperature, depending on whether embryos were cooling or heating. Cardiovascular regulation through the cardiac limb of the baroreflex was not affected by temperature, despite previous studies suggesting that vagal tone is present at both low and high temperatures.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

For example, biliverdin is produced in the liver and spleen from the breakdown of heme, and has putative immune-suppressing and antioxidant properties. However, the majority of these properties have been investigated in vitro or in mammalian models, in which biliverdin reductase converts virtually all biliverdin to bilirubin. Thus, biliverdin’s physiological roles remain largely untested. Here, we investigated whether biliverdin has immunomodulating roles by injecting Northern Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) with either a vehicle control, lysed and rinsed pig red blood cells (pRBC) that contain erythrocyte antigens but no heme, or intact pRBC that contain both erythrocyte antigens and hemoglobin, thus increasing the amount of heme that can be converted to biliverdin. We then quantified hemagglutination and hemolysis ability, and biliverdin concentration in the liver and spleen, on 3, 6, and 9 days post-injection. We found that hemagglutination was greater in individuals that received intact pRBC, but not in those injected with heme-removed pRBC, demonstrating that biliverdin does not suppress immune function at this dosage. Biliverdin levels of liver and spleen were correlated within individuals, suggesting organism-level variation in biliverdin production. Lastly, individuals injected with intact pRBC had a reduced biliverdin concentration in the spleen, suggesting that immune challenges may reduce biliverdin production or accumulation. This initial investigation demonstrated that biliverdin may have more nuanced physiological roles than previously reported, supporting the value of further investigations into the physiology of biliverdin.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In swimming fish, power-producing muscles work in concert with the accessory muscles of the fins which augment and control power transfer to the water. Although fin muscles represent a significant proportion of the locomotor muscle mass, their physiological properties are poorly characterized. To examine the relationship between muscle metabolism and the differing mechanical demands placed on distinct muscle groups, we quantified the aerobic and glycolytic capacities of the myotomal, pectoral and caudal muscles of bluegill sunfish. These were indicated by the activities of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase, rate-limiting enzymes for aerobic respiration and glycolysis, respectively. The well-established roles of slow and fast myotomal muscle types in sustained and transient propulsive movements allows their use as benchmarks to which other muscles can be compared to assess their function. Slow myotomal muscle had the highest CS activity, consistent with meeting the high metabolic and mechanical power demands of body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming at the upper end of the aerobically supported speed range. The largest pectoral adductors and abductors had CS activities lower than the slow myotomal muscle, in line with their role supplying thrust for low-speed, low-power swimming. The metabolic capacities of the caudal muscles were surprisingly low and inconsistent with their activity during steady-state BCF swimming at high speeds. This may reflect adaptation to the observed swimming behavior in the field, which typically involved short bouts of BCF-propulsive cycles rather than sustained propulsive activity.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

Thus, it is important that the auditory system has a high temporal resolution to effectively process and extract relevant information from click echoes. This study used auditory evoked potential methods to investigate auditory temporal resolution of individuals from four different odontocete species, including a spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris), pygmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata), long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas), and Blainville’s beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris). Each individual had previously stranded and was undergoing rehabilitation. Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) were elicited via acoustic stimuli consisting of a train of broadband tone pulses presented at rates between 300 and 2000 Hz. Similar to other studied species, modulation rate transfer functions (MRTFs) of the studied individuals followed the shape of a low-pass filter, with the ability to process acoustic stimuli at presentation rates up to and exceeding 1250 Hz. Auditory integration times estimated from the bandwidths of the MRTFs ranged between 250 and 333 µs. The results support the hypothesis that high temporal resolution is conserved throughout the diverse range of odontocete species.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

We tested to what extent baseline blood glucose level is a repeatable trait in adult zebra finches, and whether glucose levels were associated with age, manipulated environmental conditions during development (rearing brood size) and adulthood (foraging cost), and lifespan. We found that: (1) repeatability of glucose levels was 30%, both within and between years. (2) Having been reared in a large brood and living with higher foraging costs as adult were independently associated with higher glucose levels. Furthermore, the finding that baseline glucose was low when ambient temperature was high, and foraging costs were low, indicates that glucose is regulated at a lower level when energy turnover is low. (3) Survival probability decreased with increasing baseline glucose. We conclude that baseline glucose is an individual trait negatively associated with survival, and increases due to adverse environmental conditions during development (rearing brood size) and adulthood (foraging cost).

In preparation to hibernation, fat-storing hibernators accumulate large quantities of body fat, which increases their locomotor costs and also the risk of predation. As a consequence, there should be a strong selective pressure to restrict pre-hibernation fattening to a short-time period before the onset of hibernation. The edible dormouse (Glis glis) is characterized by having adapted its whole life history to the irregularly occurring mast-seeding pattern of the European beech (Fagus sylvaticus). Thus, the question arises how this small endotherm copes with huge differences in food availability between years. Therefore, we investigated body mass and thermal energetics of edible dormice during high and low food years. Our results demonstrate that during periods of low food availability, edible dormice enter an energy-saving mode with reduced body temperature (Tb) and resting metabolic rate (RMR), and high torpor frequencies. During irregularly occurring short events of high food availability in mast years, however, Tb was higher, torpor did not occur, and RMR was drastically elevated possibly due to an enlarged digestive tract and the heat increment of feeding associated with a dietary switch to high-quality food and an increase in the amount of food ingested. This physiological flexibility allows edible dormice to efficiently accumulate body fat reserves under extremely different situations of food availability.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

In the jeju the anterior section of the posterior bladder is highly vascularized, and the swimbladder is used for aerial respiration; the traira, in turn, is a water-breather that uses the swimbladder as a buoyancy organ and not for aerial oxygen uptake. Measurement of swimbladder oxygen partial pressure (PO2) of fish kept at 26 °C in normoxic, hyperoxic (28–32 mg O2 L− 1) or hypoxic (1–1.5 mg O2 L− 1) water revealed constant values in traira swimbladder. Under normoxic conditions in the jeju swimbladder PO2 was higher than in traira, and the PO2 significantly increased under hyperoxic conditions, even in the absence of air breathing. In jeju, air-breathing activity increased significantly under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic air-breathing activity was negatively correlated to swimbladder PO2, indicating that the swimbladder was intensely used for gas exchange under these conditions. In traira, the capacity of the ROS defense system, as assessed by measurement of activities of enzymes involved in ROS degradation and total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) concentration, was elevated after 4 h of hyperoxic and/or hypoxic exposure, although swimbladder PO2 was not affected. In jeju, experiencing a higher variability in swimbladder PO2 due to the air-breathing activity, only a reduced responsiveness of the ROS defense system to changing environmental PO2 was detected.",True,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False

A potent source of noise in animal communication is that arising from other conspecific signals, whose co-occurrence can result in extensive interference—evident as the so called “cocktail-party problem”—that may affect the receiver mechanisms to detect potential mates. We studied grasshopper females to explore how modifications of the song pattern influence song recognition. First, we degraded an attractive model song with random fluctuations of increasing amplitudes out of different frequency bands, and determined “critical degradation levels” at which the females ceased to respond. A masker band with frequencies between 0 and 200 Hz, which covers the frequency range of the natural song envelope, was by 3–5 dB more destructive in hampering signal recognition than frequencies above 200 Hz. As second approach, we applied temporal disturbances such as accentuations or gaps at different positions within the song subunits and observed how response behavior was affected. Accentuations at subunit start increased, whereas those in the midst or at the end of a subunit reduced attractiveness. Gaps at these positions had diverse effects. The results are discussed with respect to neuronal filtering.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The functions of 5-HT in central nervous system are intensively studied; however, the presynaptic effects of 5-HT in frog spinal motoneurons are practically unexplored. We have previously shown that 5-HT decreases the frequency of glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (mIPSPs), but does not affect the frequency of GABAergic mIPSPs and increases the frequency of glutamatergic postsynaptic potentials. In the present study, using pharmacological methods and intracellular recordings in motoneurons from an adult frog’s isolated spinal cord, we aimed to identify the 5-HT receptor subtype responsible for inhibiting the release of glycine. Аn agonist of 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, and a selective agonist of 5-HT2 receptors, α-Ме-5-НТ, did not show any significant effect on inhibitory transmission, indicating that 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT7 receptors are not involved in the modulation of glycine release in the adult frog spinal cord. An agonist of 5-HT1B/D receptors sumatriptan decreased the frequency (but not the amplitude) of glycinergic mIPSPs similar to 5-HT. An antagonist of 5-HT1,2 receptors, methysergide, abolished the effect of sumatriptan. Together our results suggest that 5-HT inhibits the release of glycine by activation of 5-HT1B/D receptors.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,False

The goal of this study was to characterize the mechanistic hypercarbia-recovery strategies in the highly CO2 tolerant hagfish. We exposed hagfish to hypercapnia (30 Torr) for 48 h and allowed a 24 h recovery period in normocapnic seawater. Within 8 h of the recovery period, the compensatory plasma [HCO3−] load (~ 70 mmol L−1) was rapidly offloaded. While increases in both whole-animal HCO3− excretion and glomerular filtration were observed throughout recovery (2–8 h), neither can fully account for the observed rates of whole-animal HCO3− loss, which peaked at ~ 3.5 mmol kg−1 h−1. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase via acetazolamide revealed that the restoration of plasma [HCO3−] from hypercapnia-induced hypercarbia is likely facilitated in a dualistic manner, initially relying on both carbonic anhydrase mediated CO2 offloading and Cl−/HCO3− exchange processes, both of which are likely either upregulated or further activated as recovery progresses.",False,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,False
